He has introduced many Bills in the D\u00e1il, including the Parole Bill 2016.Jim drafted and secured cross-party support for his Parole Bill 2016, which was passed by the Oireachtas (D\u00e1il and Seanad \u00c9ireann) and became an Act in 2019. It comprehensively reformed the parole system, giving victims of crime and their families the right to be heard during the parole process.The Oireachtas also passed Jim\u2019s proposals to expand the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.Jim served as legal adviser to Fianna F\u00e1il from 2011 \u2013 2016. In May 2016, following his election to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, he was appointed party front-bench spokesman on Justice and Equality.He is currently the party\u2019s front bench spokesman on justice.Legal careerA barrister, Jim is a Senior Counsel. He holds degrees in Law from University College Dublin (UCD), Cambridge University and the King\u2019s Inns.Personal careerAn avid rugby fan, Jim played at senior level. Capped for Ireland at under-21 level, he also represented UCD, Cambridge University, London Irish, Wanderers, Leinster and Connacht. A keen cyclist, he supports the expansion of the cycling infrastructure in Dublin.Fianna F\u00e1il is a centre-left national party.Name originFianna F\u00e1il loosely translates as \u2018soldiers of destiny\u2019 or \u2018warriors of F\u00e1l\u2019. It\u2019s full name is \u201cFianna F\u00e1il \u2013 The Republican Party\u201d.IdeologyThe party\u2019s name and logo incorporates the words \u2018The Republican Party\u2019. \u201cRepublican\u201d here stands both for the unity of the island of Ireland and a commitment to the historic principles of European republican philosophy, namely liberty, equality and fraternity. The party\u2019s enduring goal is to reunite the north and the south of Ireland.ConstructionThe party was founded as an Irish republican party on 16 May 1926 by \u00c9amon de Valera and his supporters after they split from the anti-treaty wing of Sinn F\u00e9in on the issue of abstentionism in the aftermath of the Irish Civil War.The party dominated Irish political life for most of the 20th century, and, since its foundation, either it or Fine Gael has led every government. Between 1932 and 2011, it was the largest party in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, but latterly with a decline in its vote share; from 1989 onwards, its periods of government were in coalition with parties of either the left or the right.EvolutionFianna F\u00e1il\u2019s vote collapsed in the 2011 general election; it emerged in third place, in what was widely seen as a political realignment in the wake of the post-2008 Irish economic downturn. By 2016 it had recovered enough to become the largest opposition party, and it entered a confidence and supply arrangement with a Fine Gael-led minority government.In 2020, after a number of months of political stalemate following the general election, Fianna F\u00e1il agreed with Fine Gael and the Green Party to enter into an unprecedented grand coalition, with the leaders of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael rotating between the roles of Taoiseach and T\u00e1naiste.Dublin Bay South ConstituencyDublin Bay South ConstituencyConstituency Profiles23 December 2020Dublin Bay South is one of 39 constituencies.
