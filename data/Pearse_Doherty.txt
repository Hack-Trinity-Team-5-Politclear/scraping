He also previously served as aSenatorfor theAgricultural Panelfrom 2007 to 2010.[1]Early life[edit]Pearse Daniel Doherty was born inGlasgowon 6 July 1977, the son of Irish parents. When he was three years old, the family returned home to theIrish-speaking townofGweedore, where he grew up and became fluent inIrish.[2]He enrolled in acivil engineeringdegree course atDublin Institute of Technologyin 1996. In 1999, Doherty,Matt Carthyand two other Sinn F\u00e9in activists were arrested in Dublin. At a court hearing it was alleged that Doherty had abused a Garda, though it was argued Doherty's comment was the consequence of a \"simple misunderstanding\" and was not at anyway intended to offend the Garda. He was convicted, but was given the benefit of theProbation Actin lieu of a criminal record.[3][4]He completed two years of the course, earning anational certificatethat entitled him to work as a civil engineering technician. He then left third-level education to pursue a job in that field.[5]He later resumed his studies by enrolling in another civil engineering course atLetterkenny Institute of Technology, but dropped out in order to run forD\u00e1il \u00c9ireannin the2002 general election.[6]Political career[edit]A member ofSinn F\u00e9insince 1996, Doherty was a founding member ofSinn F\u00e9in Republican Youthand served on its national executive.In the 2002 general election, Doherty ran unsuccessfully in theDonegal South-Westconstituency. On 11 June 2004, he ran simultaneously in thelocal electionsforDonegal County Counciland in the2004 European Parliament elections. He failed to win a seat in the European Parliament, but was elected to serve as a member of Donegal County Council for theGlentieslocal electoral area.[7]Doherty's second attempt to win a D\u00e1il seat, at the2007 general election, also proved unsuccessful; he received 21.2% of the first-preference vote. However, he was elected toSeanad \u00c9ireannas a Senator for theAgricultural Panelon 24 July 2007.[7]On 12 July 2010, theHigh Courtgranted Doherty a judicial review into why the government had not held a by-election to fill the D\u00e1il seat vacated byFianna F\u00e1il'sPat \"the Cope\" Gallagherwhen he wonelection to the European Parliament in June 2009.[8]On 2 November 2010, the High Court ruled that the government had delayed unreasonably in holding the by-election. In response to the ruling, the government announced that theDonegal South-West by-electionwould be held on 25 November 2010. Doherty stood as the Sinn F\u00e9in candidate and won the by-election by a substantial margin, earning 39.8 percent of the first-preference vote.[9][10]On taking his seat in the D\u00e1il, Doherty was appointed Sinn F\u00e9in's spokesperson on Finance. However, the D\u00e1il was dissolved on 1 February 2011, at which point Doherty had been a TD for just over nine weeks.Shortly before the2011 general election, several newspapers alleged that Doherty had misled the public by stating on various Sinn F\u00e9in andOireachtaswebpages that he had formerly worked as a \"civil engineer\", an occupation that presumes a degree-level qualification. Doherty insisted that he had \"always been upfront\" about the fact that he had not completed his degree, clarified his educational credentials, and acknowledged that he had qualified as a civil engineering technician and not a civil engineer.[6][11]In that election Doherty topped the poll decisively in Donegal South-West, attaining 33.0% of the first-preference vote.[12]Doherty represented Sinn F\u00e9in in the Oireachtas delegation that met theBundestag's Budgetary and European Affairs committees inBerlinin late January 2012.[13]It was revealed in June 2012, that Doherty put \u20ac8,000 worth of unspent travel and accommodation expenses towards hiring part-time party workers, despite these expenses being supposed to be returned to the Oireachtas under rules introduced in 2010.[14]A report found that he had not breached any expense rules, and cleared him of any wrongdoing.[15]At the2016 general election, after a redrawing of constituency boundaries, Doherty was elected to the new five-seaterDonegalconstituency on the 8th count.[16]He topped the poll at the2020 general election, and was appointed leader of Sinn F\u00e9in's negotiations team.[17]On 16 June 2022, Doherty clashed withT\u00e1naisteLeo Varadkarin the D\u00e1il. Doherty attacked Varadkar for being \"out of touch\" and brought up Varadkar's legal issues with the DPP. Varadkar responded by calling it a \"cheap shot\" and brought up a 1999 in which Doherty was convicted of abusing a Garda, saying \"You abused, mistreated a Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. For that you were prosecuted. You were found guilty. Yes, you got away without a conviction because of your age at the time, but you were actually prosecuted. You were arrested. That's what happened to you.\"[18]Personal life[edit]Doherty continues to reside inGweedore. He is married to R\u00f3is\u00edn, a school teacher fromCounty Monaghan. They have four sons.[19]References[edit]^\"Pearse Doherty\". Oireachtas Members Database.Archivedfrom the original on 8 November 2018.

Before politics he worked as a civil engineering technician and on an EU-funded project that trained, educated and counselled former republican prisoners. He was elected a councillor in 2004 before becoming a Senator in 2007. In 2010, after taking the previous government to the High Court over a delay in holding the Donegal South West by-election he was elected a TD in the by-election. He is married to R\u00f3is\u00edn and has three sons.How did you get involved in politics?I never expected to get involved in electoral politics. From a very early age I wanted to be involved in Sinn F\u00e9in. I wanted to be involved in the republican struggle, to be part of freeing our country. Though I was only three or four years of age in 1981, 10 years later, reading about the hunger strikes as a 13 year old lit a spark inside me, and from that I just knew that I wanted to be involved in playing my part to try and bring an end to what was the injustice in the North. That was at a very young age and then I opened my eyes to see that we didn\u2019t just have injustice in the North, we had injustice right across the island and from there eventually I kind of stumbled into getting involved in electoral politics.What issues is Sinn F\u00e9in prioritising during the 31st D\u00e1il?To make sure that whatever policies the Government brings forward are fair, that they don\u2019t affect the most vulnerable and the most in need in a negative way, to try and protect public services while at thesame time trying to reduce our deficit and get back into the bond markets.Our job is to put very credible alternatives on the table, to show to people that there is a real alternative: that people shouldn\u2019t buy into this notion that there is no other way. We have a range of proposals that will see the middle income earners, those that are dependent on social welfare and public services protected, while at the same time there are hard decisions in our policies for some people who have additional wealth, because we believe they should pay more so we can protect those at the bottom of the ladder.The other issue is job creation. We have a genuine belief that our economy and country can\u2019t recover unless we create jobs, that we can\u2019t afford to have nearly half a million people out of work, and we can\u2019t afford the social consequences of trying to make it affordable.What are the main issues facing Donegal South West and the region?The main issue is unemployment, even during the height of the Celtic Tiger unemployment rates in Donegal South West were over 20 per cent, so getting people back to work and providing them with those opportunities.Another major issue is the services which people rely on, because it is very much an isolated rural constituency, and the border makes it all that much harder because we\u2019re cut off from the rest of the state. It\u2019s about making sure we have the proper investment and giving people the proper opportunities.When, if ever, do you think there will be a united Ireland?Bobby Sands wrote in the last words he ever wrote in his diary on hunger strike: \u201cThe day will dawn when all the people of Ireland will have the desire for freedom to show.\u201d I think that\u2019s one of the things that we need to work on, that we need to get more people to realise that a united Ireland is achievable. For the first time, since the Good Friday Agreement, we now have the legal instruments to bring about a united Ireland through a border poll. It\u2019s impossible to set a date on it but I want to see a united Ireland in my lifetime.I\u2019m an impatient republican. I\u2019m not happy just to wait and let it happen gradually, I believe that we can make decisions and take actions today that will lead to a united Ireland quicker than it may happen. It will happen eventually but I want to see it happen quicker than eventually.What do you think are the three biggest challenges facing the Minister for Finance?To ensure that the budget that he brings in, with the type of adjustment that\u2019s talked about, is fair, and that it\u2019s seen to be fair by the public.The second thing is to convince our European partners that we cannot pay back all of the \u20ac64 billion of banking debt, and we need a write-down on that debt.And the third thing is to steer our economy in a different way, away from the kind of greedy, ugly, selfish style in which the economy developed during the Celtic Tiger, into a fairer, more equal, balanced economy into the future.From your own experience how does the D\u00e1il contrast with the Seanad as a parliamentary chamber?I think there\u2019s a massive difference between the D\u00e1il and the Seanad. For a start there\u2019s a chance that somebody is listening to you when you\u2019re speaking in the D\u00e1il, there\u2019s very little chance in the Seanad. The Seanad doesn\u2019t get the media attention that it deserves.During my time in the Seanad I felt very frustrated because I felt that what I was doing was quite irrelevant, and that\u2019s very different than in the D\u00e1il. In my own experience I saw a huge contrast because I went from being in the Seanad one week to the D\u00e1il the next week, delivering the response to the budget, carried live on TV. That kind of example showed me that people do not have a huge regard for the Seanad, and the reason they don\u2019t is because they don\u2019t know their senators. It\u2019s undemocratic, elitist and out of date. There\u2019s a huge difference and there is no need for the Seanad in its current form.What deputies in the other political parties do you admire and why?Admire is a word that I don\u2019t use, whether you ask me about my own party or other parties. I think respect would be a more appropriate word. I respect people who speak their minds. Recently we\u2019ve seen Tommy Broughan and Peter Matthews speaking their minds. There are many others in the different political parties that I respect as well. I respect people who have conviction politics. I respect the stance that was taken by Denis Naughten in what was a difficult stance for him.Name three people you would invite to a dinner party?Tommy Tiernan to keep craic going at the dinner table, Francis Black for a good sing song afterwards, and my wife so I don\u2019t get into trouble the next day.How you do you like to spend your spare time?Just relaxing, catching up with the boys. I love a good movie at the cinema or on TV just to chill out.TagsPolitical PlatformAugust 2011Show MoreShareFacebookXLinkedInWhatsAppShare via EmailCheck AlsoClosePublic AffairsDoireann N\u00ed Ghr\u00edofa:A Ghost in the ThroatDecember 2020AnalysisGovernment misses waiting list reduction targetAnalysis,IssuesHousing 2022 reflections  Overall housing target on track but crisis aboundsAnalysis,IssuesGalway City: The beating heart of the westAnalysis,Regional focus: Galway City CouncilThe cost-of-living budgetAnalysis,IssuesCategoriesCategoriesSelect Category100 years of policing reportAgribusiness magazineAgriculture Food and DrinkAnalysisBanking & FinanceBrexitBusinessClimate COP26 reportConnectivity and future of workConnectivity reportCover StoryCybersecurity reportData protection reportDelivering cost rental housing reportDigitalDigital government reportDigital government reportEconomyEducationEnergy & EnvironmentEnergyEnvironmentRetrofiteolasEurope and BrexitFeaturedFintech ReportFuture of policing reportFuture of rail reportFuture of work and connectivity reportHealth and care servicesHousingInfrastructureRoad safetyInfrastructure and construction reportIssuesJusticeLocal GovernmentLocal government reportMol an \u00f3igePeoplePoliticsPublic AffairsReformRegional focus: Galway City CouncilRegional focus: Leitrim County CouncilReportsArtificial intelligence reportInfrastructure and construction reportRetrofitting reportRound table discussion: Cyber-resilience in an age of ransomwareRound table discussion: Digital transformation of public servicesRound table discussion: Driving electric vehicle adoption in IrelandRound table discussion: Evolution or revolution?
