McHugh was re-elected to the D\u00e1il at the2011 general election, attaining 19.3% of the first-preference vote.In January 2011, McHugh called for a monument, funded by the government, in Donegal, dedicated to the founding of theUlster Volunteer Forcein 1912.[7]McHugh was criticised by Eileen Doherty, a sister ofDonegal County CouncillorandProvisional IRAmemberEddie Fullerton, who was assassinated by loyalists in 1991. Doherty claimed McHugh and other Fine Gael councillors in Donegal had snubbed a number of commemorative events and opposed the building of a monument in Fullerton's memory inBuncrana. Fullerton was the third elected official in the Republic of Ireland to be assassinated.[8]InManchesterin October 2011, McHugh became the first Fine Gael TD to address delegates from the BritishConservative Party. He described it as an \"opportunity.\"[9]On 15 July 2014, he was appointed asMinister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resourcesandat the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltachtwith responsibility for Gaeltacht Affairs and Natural Resources.[10][11][12]His appointment was met with criticism as his knowledge of theIrish languagewas at a basic level,[13][14]although he subsequently received praise for his efforts to improve his language skills to the point where he could conduct lengthy interviews in the language.[15]RT\u00c9 Radio 1produced the radio documentaryFine Gaeilgeoir,narrated and produced by M\u00e1ire Treasa N\u00ed Cheallaigh, following McHugh's efforts to improve his Irish over the course of a year.[16]Shane Ross later wrote of his fear of having what he described as a \"Joe McHugh moment\", meaning being a non-Irish speaker to a Gaeltacht ministry.[17]In February 2016, McHugh was heavily criticised for allocating 93% of Gaeltacht grants to the Donegal Gaeltacht, which is located in and beside his constituency. This revelation led to calls for McHugh to appear before the D\u00e1ilPublic Accounts Committeeto explain such a disproportionate allocation of funding.[18]McHugh subsequently denied the claims.[19]At the2016 general election, McHugh was elected to the new five-seaterDonegalconstituency on the 11th count.[20]The following May, he metCharles, Prince of Wales, andCamilla, Duchess of Cornwall, during their day visit to the county.[21]He was appointed asMinister for Education and Skillson 16 October 2018.[22]He was not re-appointed to theGovernment of the 33rd D\u00e1ilin June 2020, and declined the offer of appointment as a Minister of State.[23]In September 2020, McHugh became Chair of theCommittee on European Union Affairs.In May 2022, McHugh announced that he would not stand at thenext general election.[2][3]On 6 July 2022, McHugh resigned the Fine Gael party whip in order to vote for an opposition bill regarding theMica scandal.[24]Personal life[edit]In July 2005, McHugh marriedOlwyn Enright, who served as a Fine Gael TD forLaois\u2013Offalyfrom 2002 to 2011.

Photo: Gareth ChaneyMica affected homeowners from around Ireland are seeking 100pc redress for the faulty concrete blocks in their homes. Photo: Stephen Collins/Collins PhotosKevin DoyleThu 7 Jul 2022 at 03:30Former Fine Gael minister Joe McHugh has not decided whether he will support the Government in future D\u00e1il votes after resigning the party whip.The Donegal TD went against his Coalition colleagues last night as they sought to progress legislation that will underpin a \u20ac2.7bn redress scheme for homeowners affected by the mica scandal.His decision means the number of Government TDs has dropped to 79, leaving them shy of a guaranteed majority ahead of September\u2019s Budget.Mr McHugh told theIrish Independentthat people in his constituency were not satisfied with the scheme and he could not stand over it.Read moreWhy Covid-19 and shortage of dentists are impacting the price of having your tooth filledWhile he thanked Housing Minister Darragh O\u2019Brien for trying to devise a workable scheme, he said a decision to limit D\u00e1il debate last night to just two hours was the final straw for him.\u201cI am making this decision with a clear head,\u201d he said, adding that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t in good conscience\u201d vote for the bill. Afterwards he resigned the Fine Gael party whip.Asked whether he will support Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe\u2019s Budget in September, the former education minister replied: \u201cI haven\u2019t thought it that far through.\u201dFine Gael leader Leo Varadkar last night told TDs and senators he expects the Government will be able to rely on Mr McHugh\u2019s vote on issues outside of the mica redress scheme.Two Green Party TDs are suspended from the government benches until November, meaning the Government could be at the mercy of some Independent TDs for the Budget.Parts of Mr McHugh\u2019s constituency have been blighted by the presence of mica in concrete blocks used in the construction of homes. Many families have seen walls in their properties literally crumble as a result.There were rowdy scenes in the D\u00e1il last night as some campaigners sought to voice their unhappiness with the scheme from the public gallery.Explaining his vote, Mr McHugh said: \u201cI\u2019m talking in particular about people who are my generation and a bit older. People who are going to find it hard to get a \u20ac30,000-\u20ac40,000 loan upfront [to finish a rebuild project].\u201dHe acknowledged Mr O\u2019Brien was rushing the legislation in an attempt to have it passed before the D\u00e1il goes into summer recess later this month \u2013 but said there need to be changes. \u201cThe downsizing was a big issue for me, and I still think it\u2019s unfair for somebody who wishes to downsize, that unfairness in being penalised... I felt very strongly on that point, and I\u2019ll continue to raise that point.\u201dRead moreWhy Covid-19 and shortage of dentists are impacting the price of having your tooth filledJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channelStay up to date with all the latest newsRelated topicsFine GaelMicaDarragh O'BrienGreen PartyDonegal newsLatest PoliticsCatherine Martin in war of words with RT\u00c9\u2019s board after chair Si\u00fan N\u00ed Raghallaigh effectively \u2018sacked\u2019 live on TVLower rates for school buses to stay for another academic year, with plans to expand eligibilityMarch referendums focus on family, but it\u2019s hard to ignore the anti-immigrant agenda from someDrug cautions system \u2018clearly not working\u2019 as cannabis possession charges top 17,000Sammy Wilson quits as DUP\u2019s chief whip at Westminster following party\u2019s Stormont return\u2018Concerning situation\u2019 as around 1,000 male asylum seekers now without accommodation in IrelandMinister Helen McEntee says Ireland needs to be \u2018realistic\u2019 about domestic violence refuge spaces, as Cuan agency launchedMore than 2,000 carers to get state pension after reformsFianna F\u00e1il backbenchers want more countries put on \u2018safe\u2019 listExplainer: Why the FAI was called before the Public Accounts Committee \u2013 and a redacted email caused annoyance among TDsShow moreTop StoriesSoccerExclusive|The Stephen Kenny interview: \u2018Some people don\u2019t just want to criticise you, they really want to seriously damage your reputation\u2019Irish News\u2018Abusers hide in plain sight, he was a monster behind closed doors,\u2019 says stepdaughter of paedophile ex-rugby player Davy TweedNewsTipperary engineering firm offers \u20ac10,000 reward to catch thieves who stole goods worth over \u20ac70,000CelebrityMel B says she was left with \u00a3700 to her name and forced to shop in Aldi after divorceLatest NewsMoreCelebrity NewsVin Diesel shares update on Fast And Furious \u2018grand finale\u201914:35GAAOutgoing GAA president Larry McCarthy describes Belfast court sitting as the \u2018worst day\u2019 of his three-year tenure14:33GAAGAA Congress: Motion to allow players to play U20 and senior inter-county championship games in same week passed14:22Six NationsLive|Ireland v Wales, Six Nations \u2013 Andy Farrell\u2019s men seek win to keep Grand Slam bid alive14:10GAAGAA Congress: Verbal abuse of match officials to carry minimum two-match ban13:46Celebrity NewsGraham Norton announces he is quitting Virgin Radio weekend shows13:30CrimeMichael Lynn enjoys \u2018model prisoner\u2019 status behind bars13:25RadioGraham Norton confirms he is leaving Virgin Radio weekend show with Irish presenter to fill in as temporary replacement13:24CelebrityMel B says she was left with \u00a3700 to her name and forced to shop in Aldi after divorce12:56EuropeDeath toll in Spain apartment block fire rises to 1012:56Top StoriesMoreCrimeMichael Lynn enjoys \u2018model prisoner\u2019 status behind barsSix NationsLive|Ireland v Wales, Six Nations \u2013 Andy Farrell\u2019s men seek win to keep Grand Slam bid aliveSex & RelationshipsAsking for a friend: My family took my husband\u2019s side after I cheated and moved in with my new partner.

Photo: Gareth Chaney, CollinsPhilip Ryan and Paul HylandWed 4 May 2022 at 12:14Former Education Minister Joe McHugh will not contest the next general election for Fine Gael.In a statement, Mr McHugh said he is stepping away from politics to spend more time with his family.The former minister\u2019s constituency has been a hotbed for public disquiet with the Government over the Mica controversy which has left thousands of homes crumbling beyond repair. Donegal homeowners remain unhappy with the State\u2019s enhanced grant scheme for those affected by the defective blocks.\u201cIn this current D\u00e1il, I remain committed to Mica redress and I will continue to work in the D\u00e1il, and with my council colleagues on this crucial issue, as well as all the other issues affecting Donegal,\u201d Mr McHugh said.Read moreWhy former minister Joe McHugh\u2019s exit from politics spells trouble for Leo Varadkar\u201cEverything that I have achieved has been with the help and support of both the Fine Gael organisation and so many people in the wider community in Donegal,\u201d he added.Mr McHugh said the last two years of the pandemic has given him time for reflection and he wants to be around more for his children as they grow older. Mr McHugh has three children with former Fine Gael TD Olwyn Enright who also left politics.\u201cPolitics is a 24/7 job that demands absolute commitment. I have given politics everything I could throughout my career and it has been my greatest honour to serve as a TD representing the people of Donegal in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann,\u201d he said.\u201cI have always given my full commitment to my role as a public representative and this won\u2019t change in this current D\u00e1il, however, after the next election, I want to focus more on my family life.\u201cMy election to this current D\u00e1il by the people of Donegal is a mandate which I will continue to diligently serve for the lifetime of this D\u00e1il. I can assure you that I will work as hard as ever for the remainder of this D\u00e1il serving my constituents and this county.\u201cI am making my intentions clear now, well in advance of the next General Election, to give the Fine Gael organisation and potential candidates the time to establish themselves and campaign to ensure Fine Gael will retain a seat in Donegal.\u201cI will continue to work closely with the Fine Gael organisation, and I know with the determination we have in the party, among our members and our County Councillors, we will present a strong team in the county in the next election,\u201d he added.He thanked former Taoiseach Enda Kenny and T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar for the opportunities they gave him while he served in the D\u00e1il.\u201cI want to thank all those who have given me such support and encouragement over the years, I deeply appreciate it. I also want to thank and acknowledge the hard work and dedication of all those who have worked with me in the office,\u201d he added.\u201cIt is an enormous privilege to be a public representative. It is an honour and a pleasure to be able to serve your community, your county and your country.\u201dSpeaking on the9 til Noon Showwith Greg Hughes on Highland Radio, Deputy McHugh said it was a decision he was \"brewing\" for some time, and he is \"very content\" with.He said he started to \"realise\" and \"appreciate\" how much family time he had missed out on, when he spent more time at home during the pandemic.\"The six years in the ministries were very intense... and I just realised how much I missed them,\" he said.He said the two-year run into his retirement gives him comfort because he knows there is an \"endgame\" in sight.Mr McHugh said he has had a \"good run\" and while some people have expressed \u201cshock\u201d at his announcement today, others have acknowledged his commitment and contribution to local and national politics.Mr McHugh said his \"motivation the whole time\" was to serve the people of Donegal and he used his ministerial appointments \"in the best interests of the country and also to make up for deficits\" in his home county.He said he is \"confident\" he would win back his seat if he stood in the next election and fear of losing the election was not a motivating factor.Mr McHugh said the highlight of his career was when Leo Varadkar selected him as Education Minister.\u201cAfter putting the children to bed on a Friday night, two missed calls and Leo asking me to become Minister for Education. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I think it\u2019s the only time I got any way emotional when I got something in politics and I just felt so good about that and I wanted to do so much in it and I was glad that he put his faith in me,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, Deputy McHugh said a \"low point\u201d was during the recession years from 2011 to 2014 when Fine Gael entered Government and they were \u201cparalysed\u201d by trying the \u201cbalance the books\u201d.He added: \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the pain of having to take \u20ac30 billion of an economy over a very short couple of years\u2026 and that hurt people. We eventually got the economy back on track again, but a lot of people had difficult times along the way and it wasn\u2019t nice seeing that and meeting people and trying to explain that to people when people were really, really struggling and 90,000 young people emigrating. It\u2019s very hard to be part of all of that.\u201dRead moreWhy former minister Joe McHugh\u2019s exit from politics spells trouble for Leo VaradkarJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channelStay up to date with all the latest newsLatest PoliticsCatherine Martin in war of words with RT\u00c9\u2019s board after chair Si\u00fan N\u00ed Raghallaigh effectively \u2018sacked\u2019 live on TVLower rates for school buses to stay for another academic year, with plans to expand eligibilityMarch referendums focus on family, but it\u2019s hard to ignore the anti-immigrant agenda from someDrug cautions system \u2018clearly not working\u2019 as cannabis possession charges top 17,000Sammy Wilson quits as DUP\u2019s chief whip at Westminster following party\u2019s Stormont return\u2018Concerning situation\u2019 as around 1,000 male asylum seekers now without accommodation in IrelandMinister Helen McEntee says Ireland needs to be \u2018realistic\u2019 about domestic violence refuge spaces, as Cuan agency launchedMore than 2,000 carers to get state pension after reformsFianna F\u00e1il backbenchers want more countries put on \u2018safe\u2019 listExplainer: Why the FAI was called before the Public Accounts Committee \u2013 and a redacted email caused annoyance among TDsShow moreTop StoriesSoccerExclusive|The Stephen Kenny interview: \u2018Some people don\u2019t just want to criticise you, they really want to seriously damage your reputation\u2019Irish News\u2018Abusers hide in plain sight, he was a monster behind closed doors,\u2019 says stepdaughter of paedophile ex-rugby player Davy TweedNewsTipperary engineering firm offers \u20ac10,000 reward to catch thieves who stole goods worth over \u20ac70,000CelebrityMel B says she was left with \u00a3700 to her name and forced to shop in Aldi after divorceLatest NewsMoreCelebrity NewsVin Diesel shares update on Fast And Furious \u2018grand finale\u201914:35GAAOutgoing GAA president Larry McCarthy describes Belfast court sitting as the \u2018worst day\u2019 of his three-year tenure14:33GAAGAA Congress: Motion to allow players to play U20 and senior inter-county championship games in same week passed14:22Six NationsLive|Ireland v Wales, Six Nations \u2013 Andy Farrell\u2019s men seek win to keep Grand Slam bid alive14:10GAAGAA Congress: Verbal abuse of match officials to carry minimum two-match ban13:46Celebrity NewsGraham Norton announces he is quitting Virgin Radio weekend shows13:30CrimeMichael Lynn enjoys \u2018model prisoner\u2019 status behind bars13:25RadioGraham Norton confirms he is leaving Virgin Radio weekend show with Irish presenter to fill in as temporary replacement13:24CelebrityMel B says she was left with \u00a3700 to her name and forced to shop in Aldi after divorce12:56EuropeDeath toll in Spain apartment block fire rises to 1012:56Top StoriesMoreCrimeMichael Lynn enjoys \u2018model prisoner\u2019 status behind barsSix NationsLive|Ireland v Wales, Six Nations \u2013 Andy Farrell\u2019s men seek win to keep Grand Slam bid aliveSex & RelationshipsAsking for a friend: My family took my husband\u2019s side after I cheated and moved in with my new partner.
