Chris Andrews	48	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2024-02-15	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	dbsect_29	Recently, the Sporting Liberties report highlighted the severe lack of sports facilities in the inner city. It is an example of inner city neglect. Regeneration of council housing in the inner city is beyond slow. Flat complexes are being left derelict and empty for years in the middle of a housing crisis. Regeneration at Glovers Court, Pearse House and St. Andrew’s Court is painfully slow. Verschoyle Court which is just a five-minute walk from this House has 70 one-bedroom units for senior citizens, which are damp, have mould and are the size of dog boxes. That is another example of inner city neglect. The Government’s legacy will be neglect of the inner city. When will the Government take regeneration of the inner city seriously and give it the attention it really needs?	spk_310

In the view of the public, and in the experience of service providers in local communities, there is simply no co-ordination of services and no proper communication, as has been highlighted again and again. The Government is treating communities like fools and they have lost trust in it. There is no meaningful engagement with local communities and no additional support to schools or local health clinics. I was contacted by a number of school principals last week, who feel genuinely overwhelmed by the lack of supports in their schools. There is no additional support for trauma therapy, SNAs or speech and language supports. There is absolutely nothing and teachers and principals are feeling overwhelmed. Because of the Government's failure to sit down and talk with communities about their concerns and worries, they do not believe what the Government is saying.They do not believe what they hear from the Government, Dublin City Council and local authorities around the country and why would they? The international protection system has never worked and we have been saying this for years. The Government approach has been shambolic from the start. Decisions have taken way too long. We need an efficient, compassionate and enforced immigration system just like Canada or Australia. We need to have effective control over our borders. People are frustrated when they hear stories of people arriving on flights with no passports. They have no faith in the Government's process for dealing with these cases. People are extremely frustrated because there is a housing crisis. They recognise the role of migrant workers every time they visit a hospital or when they have a dental appointment. They understand the need to have an effective immigration system but they do not see one in place. All they see is billions of euro being spent on hotels and filling the pockets of profiteers, some of whom are Members of this House. On top of this, our local communities are being sucked dry by the cost of housing, rent, the worsening health system, mortgages, childcare and the cost of living; it just does not add up. The longer the Government parties are in office, the worse it is for communities in Dublin's inner city, the worse it gets for communities such as Ringsend, Pearse Street, City Quay, Kevin Street and all the inner-city communities. The immigration system is broken and vulnerable communities have to pick up the pieces. The responsibility is no one else's but Government's.	spk_170

It ruled that South Africa has a plausible case against Israel for the crime of committing genocide. It is imperative that Ireland acts and joins South Africa in this case. lreland and the EU have a duty to promote, protect and support peace and stability in the region. We must make the terror state of Israel an outcast among the international community. The EU must mirror its reaction to Russia's brutal war on Ukraine. We must see an EU-wide ban on athletes and teams representing the apartheid state of Israel. Sports cannot simply continue as if this genocide is not happening. The Irish Government should be standing by our athletes who do not want to compete against Israel. The Olympic committee stood on the right side of history in the 1960s when it barred apartheid South Africa. It is now time for the Olympic committee once again to take a stand against apartheid and ban Israel for participating in the upcoming Olympic Games. It is clear that the Olympic committee will not do this off its own bat. We need the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other EU states to call publicly on the Olympic committee to act and to stand by its declaration against ""apartheid in sport"", a declaration that calls for the total isolation of apartheid in sport. We also need the Olympic Federation of Ireland to take action and step forward. I commend the members of the Irish basketball team who are refusing to play against Israel next month. Basketball Ireland, which backed the sporting boycott of Russia, should now call for the same against Israel. Basketball Ireland should be standing by its players and calling on FIBA, basketball's world governing body, to ban Israel from competing due to the crimes of its government. History has shown us the strength of sport in fighting injustice and breaking apartheid. The message from Ireland needs to be loud and clear: ""Don't play with Apartheid."""	spk_195

However, sport is increasingly being weaponised by oppressive regimes to win positive media coverage. It is called sportswashing. In the words of Nelson Mandela, sport has the power to change the world and the power to inspire. When you see the Dublin women's Gaelic football team and their brave and inspiring call for a ceasefire in Gaza, you realise how true Mandela's words are. Israel is targeting Palestinian athletes, their sports clubs and their facilities. Yarmouk Stadium in Gaza has been turned into a detention centre for men and boys, who are daily stripped, beaten and terrorized. It is painfully clear that Israel has breached the Olympic Charter on sport on several occasions and it continues to do so. The European Council, with the support of Ireland, called on the Olympic committee to ban Russian athletes from the Olympic Games. The Council was decisive in its approach to Russian brutality. Now in the Gaza Strip, there are more than 25,000 dead, mainly innocent civilians. We need Ireland to urge the European Council to call for a ban on Israeli athletes from participating in the Olympics. We must call for Sport Ireland, the Olympic Federation of Ireland, FIFA and all the relevant sporting bodies to call for an international investigation into Israel's violation of the Olympic Charter and impose sanctions. Ban Israel from international sports. Mandela said the Irish Dunnes Stores strikers demonstrated to South Africans that ordinary people far from the crucible of apartheid cared for our freedom. In 2024, it is ordinary people in Irish sport who must show they care. Irish Sport for Palestine has called on Basketball Ireland not to play the women's basketball game against Israel on 8 February in Riga. I concur with this call.	spk_164

Prospective home buyers are being picked off by the vulture funds, and this Government's failures in housing have only increased the concerns of local communities. People who have grown up in their community want the opportunity to continue to live in there, near their support structures but without affordable housing, communities will continue to be pulled apart. The Irish Glass Bottle site gave hope to so many in Ringsend and Irishtown. It gave them the hope that they would finally be able to buy affordable homes in their community, as promised. However, with each passing month, concerns about affordability grow. The Irish Glass Bottle site will have 950 homes on it, a mix of social and affordable homes. However, it is hard to see how the how the so-called affordable homes on the site will actually be affordable. The well-informed speculation is that the homes on the site will come in at between €600,000 and €700,000 each. Even with the Government subvention, that will not be affordable for ordinary families. The only people that will be able to afford the homes on the site are vulture funds and the extremely wealthy. I ask the Minister to give an assurance to the community that vulture funds will not be allowed to buy up all of the homes on the Irish Glass Bottle site. The Government needs to put the construction of the new Dodder bridge on hold until these apartments are made affordable. If that is what it takes to make them affordable then it must be done. There is still no affordable housing scheme in place. The community has waited far too long for these new homes. The residents of Seán Moore Road are enduring construction noise from 7 a.m. each day, and the construction works are so extensive that they are concerned for the structure of their own homes. I ask the Minister to meet the developer to get answers for the local community.	spk_304

Worse still, not only is it standing by, but it is incentivising and encouraging it. We need to see urgent measures taken to put a halt to the practice of these vulture funds. Thousands upon thousands of people have been working hard and saving everything they can but they still cannot afford homes. We have a generation putting their lives on hold to simply own their own homes, but they are left fighting against the enormous wealth of these vulture funds. It is not a battle that they can win without Government intervention on their behalf. This injustice must stop. How many more housing estates will this Government allow to be sold off to vulture funds? We need to put Irish workers and families ahead of foreign vulture funds because 3,500 new homes are going to be built on the Irish Glass Bottle site. The first phase of construction is under way. Are vulture funds going to be allowed to swoop in and buy up all the homes and then rent them out to hard-working families who will not be able to afford them? The only people that will be able to afford them are the extremely wealthy. The communities I represent, such as those in Ringsend, Irishtown, and Pearse Street, are crying out for housing. They are enduring seriously high levels of construction noise and traffic from 7 a.m in the hope that the Irish Glass Bottle site will deliver affordable homes to the community. However, this site, like so many other housing developments, is being left vulnerable to bulk-buying by these virtual funds. This practice must stop. Fairness must be introduced into the housing market and the wings of the vulture funds must be clipped.	spk_378

From what I can see, this Government is effectively trying to normalise the crisis and trying to get ordinary people to think that this is just the way it is, that these things happen and that it will work its way through it. We in Sinn Féin will never accept this. This Government's failed housing policies are not working and need change. Sinn Féin is committed to being the party that builds affordable homes, regenerates inner-city flat complexes, puts an end to the greed and ensures renters are treated fairly and justly. We need to give workers and their families the type of security which renters across Europe have had for years. This Bill would ensure that ordinary workers and families have that security. The reality of failing to provide these protections is painfully clear to see. In Dublin this Christmas, over 3,000 children will wake up in emergency accommodation. I met one family today who are in a homeless hub. For them, with three children, what they are going through is absolutely devastating. It is traumatic.The long-term effect cannot be underestimated and we should not be accepting this as a normal behaviour. This Bill will protect workers and families who pay their rent on time - renters who fulfil their side of the agreement, but are left exposed to the whim of a landlord who might all of a sudden want them out. Families and workers need to be put first.	spk_190

Both these communities, along with communities right across the island of Ireland, have a deep sense of connection with the Shelbourne Park greyhound stadium. The cohesion and engagement between the stadium and the local community have been eroding in recent years. While Shelbourne Park is best known now for greyhound racing, it is less known that it was probably one of the first multisport facilities in the State. Along with greyhound racing, it has hosted Shels football club as its home ground. It was twice the venue for FAI Cup finals. In the seventies speedway racing was staged there. It was a multisport facility. There was a variety of entertainment at Shelbourne Park for the whole community. In recent decades, however, this has slipped away. This brilliant stadium, situated in the heart of the city, has failed to reach its potential. Racing only takes place there three nights a week. What is happening in Shelbourne Park can be contrasted with what has happened in the greyhound stadium in Galway. That stadium is now the home of Connacht Rugby. It is a vibrant facility that provides a mix of sporting interests. It is clear that multisport facilities are highly cost-effective, providing a great return on capital investment and a big return for the local community. Work is soon to begin on the redevelopment of Shelbourne Park. There has not really been an effort to fully utilise this facility's potential. It has huge potential. It could host a number of different sports but that commitment has to be made, supported and resourced by Government. With this development, there is talk of the stand being upgraded to a seven-day conference and meeting facility. I believe this is a missed opportunity. Community benefit should be an integral part of any redevelopment plans. Shelbourne Park has great potential to be a recreational asset to the people of all of Dublin. We must ensure this site is protected and utilised to its full potential for the community. There is growing concern in the local community that it could be lost completely. As the Minister of State knows, that site has a split ownership. The stand is owned by the greyhound community and the track is owned by a private entity. The track is under a 99-year lease from that private entity. There have been attempts by the owners of the track to have the land rezoned for housing, which clearly shows the mindset of those owning the land. That is a huge concern for the local community.

The main pillars that upheld apartheid South Africa are being replicated today in Israel, especially in the West Bank, the demarcation of the population into racial groups, the forcing of the different designated groups to reside in different geographic areas, the restriction of movement between those areas and the repressive security matrix, which includes detention, torture, censorship, banning and extrajudicial assassinations. However, one South African journalist wrote: ""We never experienced, even in the worst days of apartheid, helicopter gunships and fighter jets flying over, or tanks patrolling"". Israel is committing a textbook case of apartheid and genocide, yet people still remain divided on this issue. Are the lives of one population worth more than another? Israel continues to act contrary to international law. It is in effect rendering international law worthless and meaningless. It must be held accountable by the ICC, the EU and the international community. The Irish people clearly stand with Palestine and I urge all leaders and countries to follow suit. The actions we take today will be remembered through the annals of history. We must work together to impose sanctions and put economic and cultural pressure on the State of Israel.

It is not in the public eye as much because, understandably, people are focused on what is happening - the slaughter in the Gaza Strip. I understand that this morning at rush hour, two gunmen jumped out of a car in Jerusalem, opened fire and killed three people. I think the Tánaiste referenced that. Three civilians were killed and many others were wounded. Yesterday in the West Bank, two Palestinian children were murdered, one of whom was just nine years of age. It is painfully clear that it is innocent Palestinian and Israeli children who are paying the price for the crimes of Hamas and the Israeli Government. A ceasefire is really important but it does not seem as though the EU really believes in a ceasefire and a settlement when you contrast its actions against Russia and its actions against Israel.	spk_337

It was a damning report which highlighted the abuse of cadets. St. John Ambulance has changed little, if anything. What signal does that send to victims? What deterrent does that send to other organisations about protecting members in the event of children being sexually abused? How, as a country, do we allow there to be no consequences for current senior and former members of St. John Ambulance for the covering up of sexual abuse of children within the organisation? Questions arise as to what St. John Ambulance has done to change since Dr. Shannon's report has been published. It appears that there has been almost no change. Questions also arise as to letters sent to the Minister about changes to the board which seem not to have happened. There does not appear to be any changes. The Minister might outline the changes he sees have happened since the Shannon report following his communication with it. Why has St. John Ambulance resisted legitimate legal claims from victims it has failed, which the Shannon report highlighted? Many questions arise, but there are few answers. How can an organisation with this record, and in which the Minister has no confidence, still have access to the public, children and public funds? Mick Finnegan has campaigned on this issue for 20 years. He, along with the other survivors, is not going to give up. They feel deflated. It is almost a year to the day since the Shannon report was published and there has been no changes to deal with St. John Ambulance. It is still operating and still has access to children and adults. The board needs to step down in its entirety and a new board put in place. It is unacceptable. I know the Minister is not happy with the situation. Nobody could be. We have to ensure that St. John Ambulance and the members who were complicit in the abuse face consequences. To date, there does not appear to be any consequences for them. It is important that it does not get State funding. It has received direct State funding in the past. It is important the Minister and Government say to St. John Ambulance that it is not getting another single penny in direct funding from the State unless they see wholesale changes.	spk_446

When it comes to the FAI and gender quotas in sports organisations, they are told that if they do not meet a certain level, their funding will be cut. A similar approach needs to be applied to St. John Ambulance. It cannot be given funding when it has not implemented any clear change. There have been tiny tweaks but any change has been glacial. I know this is an important issue for the Minister and he is very committed, but the difficulty is that people just do not feel as though it is going to go anywhere. It has been a year; who knows how much longer it will take? People should not have to wait years and years for justice and for the State to intervene and put in place structures that will prevent what happened to them from happening again. They do not see that at the moment and that is very disheartening for all the survivors.

I acknowledge and extend my thoughts to the children and adults hurt in Thursday's sickening attacks. Those attacks were heartbreaking. There were many heroes on the day. I commend the gardaí who had to put up with extreme levels of violence and abuse. The gardaí on the front line were immense. The gardaí I deal with daily in the south inner city go above and beyond each and every day. Equally, gardaí do not have the resources they require. We have had 12 years of Fine Gael Ministers for justice and have a bigger population and fewer gardaí now than when Fine Gael took over. The events on Friday, for anyone representing or living in the inner city, were not surprising. We saw it coming. It is important to remember we will not police our way out of the problems in the inner city. Neglect of the inner city is a huge issue. Generational neglect by this Government is now manifesting itself.So much neglect of housing and housing estates means that many must live in conditions that are simply unacceptable and are disconnecting generations from society. A generation has been lost on this Government's watch. Residents looking at their conditions see clearly they have been let down and neglected by the State. They see the lack of educational opportunities and the lack of good jobs. They see the lack of, and poor, leisure facilities. While a complex and multilayered response is needed there needs to be a law and order response. I have regularly warned the Minister in the House that the resources are not being put in to make the city safe. Over a number of years there have been running knife battles on City Quay. Many children have now got to the ages of 15 or 16 without facing any consequences for their criminal behaviour and terrorising families in City Quay and Creighton Street. This must change. There must be consequences for those terrorising residents in the inner city. I noticed the Commissioner said recently there will be a large number of arrests, and that of course is positive. However, this is of little use when they will all be released the next day. Of the 34 people who were arrested recently, 32 were released the next day on bail. What are the consequences for those terrorising communities, because they seem to face very little or none? I heard the Taoiseach say earlier that juveniles are not immune from the law. I could say it seems to many residents in the inner city that juveniles are immune from the law. That needs to change.	spk_191

Ireland is the only state to have continuous deployment on UN and UN-mandated peace operations since 1958. We should be immensely proud of that commitment to peace and stability. We should stand fully opposed to any attempts to undermine our highly respected standing on the international stage. Where we are known as a voice for peace and justice, we should be developing our soft power and our diplomatic corps, and developing and enhancing our neutrality. While Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and the Green Party may be happy to chip away at our neutrality, it is clear that the Irish people stand firmly opposed to it. Irish people stand firmly supportive of Irish neutrality. I would be happy to hear these parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party, outline where they see Irish troops being sent. If not on a UN peacekeeping mission, where will the Irish go? Will it be off to prop up some NATO intervention? Should Irish men and women be sent off to put their lives on the line to fulfil the militarist agenda? This is an agenda which is being pushed so hard by a growing element within the EU. The EU has shown itself repeatedly to be happy to do business with rogue states such as apartheid Israel, which shows no respect for international law. This is a state which does not even hide the brutal crimes it commits. This is a state which murders thousands of children in the Gaza Strip yet this Government is telling us that we should send Irish troops to conflict zones selected by the EU. We should be standing firmly by our commitment to United Nations peacekeeping missions and not be following the militarist line. Ireland must come to the fore in the EU and pull it back to a line of peace, justice and respect.	spk_281

In the past few weeks, we have seen the devastating impact floods can have on communities, North and South and all over the island of Ireland. Last month in Midleton the main street was submerged in 3 ft of water in only eight minutes, leaving a trail of devastation in that community. There has been similar devastation in County Down, with towns such as Downpatrick, Newcastle and Newry heavily impacted by flooding. In 2002, in my constituency, Ringsend and Sandymount experienced the harsh realities of not having flood defences. It was traumatic and I distinctly remember being in the areas affected and the devastation caused for residents. I know the Irish Red Cross intervened and work has been done in Ringsend along the River Dodder, which has made a significant difference to the residents and given them a sense of security.  The Sandymount flood protection project was initiated in 2003 following the major flooding in 2002. More than 20 years on, we have seen little or no progress. All we have seen from Dublin City Council is the stalling of these works. The community is sick and tired of being given start dates for work, only for it to be stalled again and again. It is a disgrace and an insult to the local community that these vital works have been delayed again.  The most recent announcement is that there will be a delay of ten years. Understandably, residents in Ringsend are devastated by this news. Given the increase in flooding and the speed with which it happens, residents are absolutely horrified that it will take ten years before work will start again. I have been speaking with local people over the past week and they are devastated and disappointed with the news from Dublin City Council. The entire area of Sandymount is at risk of flooding. There are more than 1,000 homes in the area so the potential risk to the community is enormous. How is it possible that these works will take more than a decade to deliver? The Sandymount and Merrion Residents Association has sought a meeting with the Minister of State with responsibility for public works, Deputy O'Donovan. I would appreciate if the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, would bring the message back to his colleague the need to take the residents up on that offer to meet them. I strongly urge the Minister of State to accept that invitation. It is really important. He is, after all, from Newcastle West, a town that has suffered from the devastation of flooding, so he understands flooding. He should take up the residents' request to meet them. I ask that Minister of State with responsibility for public works also engage with Dublin City Council to seek clarity as to why a flood defence system will take ten years to deliver. I ask that he and the council work together to ensure they reduce the timeframe for the completion of these works because there is a real concern from the community that its voice is not being listened to. I ask that every effort be made to reduce the timeframe. The ten-year timeframe is far too long for people, young and old. It is not acceptable and there has to be real engagement on and an urgency about progress for flood defences in Sandymount and along the coast around Dublin Bay. It has been glacial and it needs to be speeded up as a matter of urgency.	spk_440

Clearly ten years is an unacceptable wait for residents for flood relief works to be completed. It is very important that people get their heads together. Everybody in the House would agree that families should not have to live in fear of the next flood. This is what people in Sandymount and Ringsend are worried about. In a related matter, in June there was a discharge by Uisce Éireann of large volumes of raw sewage directly onto the shoreline in Sandymount with no warning to the community and no clean up effort by Uisce Éireann. The utter lack of respect shown to users of Sandymount Strand by the likes of Uisce Éireann is an absolute disgrace. No community should be subjected to raw sewage being released onto a beach, which is an amenity and a biosphere. Uisce Éireann has also refused to deal with the serious problem caused by ectocarpus algae along the strand. It strikes me as no coincidence that we see a large bloom of algae following the discharge of wastewater into the bay from the Ringsend and Sandymount treatment plant. The look and foul odour of the algae leaves much of the strand unusable. Residents have repeatedly sought action from the council to combat the algae on the strand. Like so many other issues, their concerns seem to fall on deaf ears. The algae look and smell like faeces. The levels of algae on Sandymount Strand in recent years have increased dramatically.

There was no issue or problem referring Russia to the ICC. The hypocrisy is absolutely clear and is unacceptable. In the past 24 hours, I have received thousands of emails from members of the public asking that Ireland take a stand against the horror, the genocide and the carpet bombing engulfing the Gaza Strip. I have been told from contacts there that dogs are starting to eat the corpses of the bodies in the rubble. It is a never-ending horror. We are witnessing genocide. Today it is Palestine; tomorrow it could be anywhere. We need to see the international community take a stand against the genocide occurring in Gaza. There has to be a cost to Israel ignoring international law. Israel has faced no diplomatic consequences for breaching international law and committing war crimes and this must change. Ireland must step up and refer Israel to the ICC. Let us be straight. The EU is not a neutral body watching this genocide. It is not some innocent bystander. The reality is that the EU is an enabler of this genocide and has profited in billions due to Israel's brutal system of apartheid and its war crimes against the people of Palestine. Since 2012, the EU states have licensed over €2 billion of military contracts to Israel. The EU hints at Israel to show some restraint, but if it is serious about a lasting peace in the region it should stop selling and profiting from the weapons being used in genocide. We see the pressure that the ICC arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin has created, severely restricting his travel out of fear of arrest. Israel must be referred to the ICC and Ireland must do this.	spk_169

Some 88 UN aid workers have been murdered by Israeli bombs. Over 4,000 children have been brutally murdered. A child is murdered by Israel every ten minutes. We are watching some of the worst war crimes of the 21st century take place and the world is standing by. Even worse, many in the EU are supporting and standing by Israel as it carries out these horrific war crimes. The Irish Government needs to go beyond words and make Israel face consequences for its terror. The Government is speaking out of both sides of its mouth and it is because it is not taking action against Israel. The Irish Government hints at criticism of Israel, yet the Israeli ambassador thanked the EU for the solidarity shown towards Israel. This, as members of the EU, includes Ireland. The Government refuses to hold Israel to account. Why are there no consequences for the slaughter of children by Israel? When will the Government pass the occupied territories Bill? The following is not a huge ask. When will we recognise the state of Palestine and when will we pass the illegal Israeli settlements Bill?

That lift serves 28 families and, therefore, young and old must climb the stairs day in and day out, yet there is still no sign of it being fixed. Flooding of apartments and no ongoing maintenance is causing serious health issues for residents. The neglect is due to a lack of resources being invested in the flats and means they are becoming more and more run-down. One would imagine keeping the stairwells in the flats would be a fairly simple, straightforward job but the vast majority of stairwells in the flat complexes are disgusting as there is urine, needles and rubbish. The stairwells are untidy and smell disgusting. The failure of Government to build public homes on public land is sentencing families to a lifetime in substandard accommodation and poor health. Dublin City Council is also adding to the dereliction in streets. It has retail units and is using the ones on Townsend Street to store brushes and bins. It is completely unacceptable. It is not fair to local communities and it needs to be changed urgently.	spk_175
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-10-19	dail	33	Capital Support for Sports Facilities: Statements	dbsect_33	I acknowledge, as did the Minister of State, the contribution and the performances of the Irish rugby team in the World Cup. They were absolutely fantastic. They brought us happiness and joy and, ultimately, heartbreak. I have no doubt they will rise again. I wish Johnny Sexton, who has been an amazing servant for Irish rugby, the very best in his future journey. I welcome the time allocated in the Dáil to the speak on Government's capital support for sports facilities. We are speaking on statements on the importance of continued and enhanced capital support for sports facilities. I feel that statements on the continued underinvestment in sport facilities by the Government would have been more fitting title. Ireland, as the Minister of State said, is a sports-mad country. Sport is in every single corner of the country in communities throughout the State. We have seen record League of Ireland attendances, with stadiums selling out days in advance. What we also see at the vast majority of League of Ireland venues is the legacy of decades of neglect by successive Governments. In many cases, stadiums are in an appalling state. There is an ongoing issue with the lack of facilities for female players at grassroots level. Facilities are simply not fit for purpose. As a result, League of Ireland football is struggling to reach its full potential. There is massive potential for the League of Ireland and we have to invest in it and support it. I must ask where is the enhanced capital support for League of Ireland facilities. There is not one mention of the great work of the League of Ireland in this year's budget. The FAI put together a compelling case for the need to invest in sport. It highlighted the immense potential that Irish football has. Despite the best efforts of League of Ireland clubs and the FAI, this potential has barely been tapped into. As I have said, there is massive potential. They are operating with one hand tied behind their back due to the lack of support from the Government. Last week we heard the exciting news that Ireland would co-host the 2028 European Championships. This is a great achievement and it will be a great showcase for Ireland. It will be brilliant to see games hosted here in Dublin and in Casement Park in Belfast. Last week we also had the announcement of a legacy fund for the European Championships in 2028. It is essential that when the tournament is over there is a genuine legacy left behind to support the grassroots and League of Ireland football. If I am to be honest, the figure cited last week of €6.2 million is concerning. When we look at the costs associated with the development of Dalymount Park, €6.2 million seems like a drop in the ocean in the needs of Irish football. The cost associated with this one-off tournament is an amount of money that the League of Ireland or the grassroots of Irish football could only dream of. A national sports facility strategy at the heart of capital spending on sport facilities would ensure the most effective delivery of sports facilities in terms of costs and need. While successive Governments have spoken about a national sports facility strategy, none has ever gone as far as developing and delivering such as strategy. Over the past two decades, more than €1 billion has been invested in sport facilities. That is welcome. It has been done through programmes such as the sports capital local authority swimming pool programme and the large-scale sports infrastructure fund. Despite the large volume of money invested in sport, there remains no national strategy on the delivery and expansion of sports facilities. All are  The national sports policy gave a commitment to publish a full audit of all sports facilities throughout the State by 2020. It is three years overdue and there is still no sign of it. Perhaps the Minister of State will update it.	spk_346

Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-10-19	dail	33	Capital Support for Sports Facilities: Statements	dbsect_33	How can we effectively invest and plan for the development of sports facilities if we do not even have a clear account of what we have or what is the condition of our existing stock of facilities? The Minister of State engages with national governing bodies, as do I. They clearly show the massive demand that exists for increased sports facilities. Many of these national governing bodies have brilliant plans already in place. The missing elements are capital and core support from the Government. These national governing bodies have plans that would keep young people active in sport and help to develop the next generation of sporting heroes and role models. Their plans will help build a healthier society and increase participation in sport. At present the Government's approach clearly is not working. Participation rates are moving at a snail's pace and are a long way off the Government's targets. In our alternative budget, Sinn Féin provided for increased capital funding to reopen the large-scale sport infrastructure fund for a fresh round. The national governing bodies are urgently calling for this. We have made it clear that Sinn Féin would increase capital funding for sports facilities, providing the sports sector and local communities with the modern sports facilities that they urgently need. The sports capital and equipment programme has been the State's primary vehicle for supporting the development of local sports facilities and equipment for the past two decades. The programme has done great work. It has probably touched every parish in the State. While it has benefited a large number of clubs, many in the sports community have been calling for reform to the programme to improve it and make its impact in communities stronger. There is an issue with how the grants are paid, which I have raised previously with the Minister of State. The grants are paid after the work or equipment has been paid for and, of course, this causes problems.I referred to a club in Ringsend. It is in a working-class community that does not have the resources upfront to pay for capital works. The sports capital grant is the only grant available to sports clubs for which it is necessary to pay upfront. All other grants can be paid in advance. Smaller clubs in particular do not have the cash flows and cash reserves to pay for work. This is a clear barrier that needs to be addressed. The Minister of State mentioned the LSSIF and said additional clubs had applied. He might clarify how many clubs have done so. I ask this because I understand that only four groups have drawn down their funding from that scheme. How many groups have applied for additional funding?	spk_354

The President of the Commission was, of course, referring to Ukraine. Why do the same laws not apply to the people of Palestine? Clearly, in the eyes of Ursula von der Leyen and the European Commission, one life is more important than another. There is no other country in the world that could bomb four countries in 48 hours - Libya, Palestine, Egypt and Syria - and still be considered an innocent victim. As someone who has lived in and worked in the Gaza Strip, I find the events of recent days utterly depressing and so sad. I got to know ordinary families trying to live ordinary lives and do ordinary things. There was a huge hunger for education and a love of FC Barcelona and Real Madrid, El Clásico. I recall the young boys running around with excitement when they got Ronaldo haircuts. I support these Palestinians, not Hamas or the Palestinian Authority, PA. I lived in the Gaza Strip and I know the difference. The slaughter of civilians, whether they be Palestinian or Israeli, is unforgivable and a war crime. All those who kill civilians must be held accountable. Equally, the events of the past ten days have not arisen out of thin air. They occurred because of decades of apartheid, murder and torture of Palestinians. They also occurred because of the failure of Ireland to hold Israel to account. We hear a lot of people talking about peace but without justice, there can be no peace. The time for the Irish Government to act in unison with the EU has long passed. The Irish Government must step forward and take action. We urgently need to see a ceasefire and the release of hostages. Ireland needs to boycott, divest and sanction Israel. We must pass the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill 2023 and the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018. We must expel the Israeli ambassador and seek that the International Criminal Court issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu who is a war criminal. Ursula von der Leyen must be sacked because her behaviour has been absolutely abysmal."	spk_218

Mick has been a tireless advocate for survivors of sexual abuse in St. John Ambulance Ireland and he has been hugely affected, like all survivors have been. He has devoted his life to getting some sort of answers and consequences for those who abused him and many others. I would like to acknowledge Mick's presence here. I recently saw some script from Joe Mooney, who said:It is to Ireland's shame that survivors must exhaust themselves from pleading to be heard. It still appears child protection is everybody's business until it is not.That resonated with me, and I think it resonates with most people and certainly survivors. I have to ask, does the Minister feel that serious reforms have been made? There does not appear to be any. Nothing is happening, and everything seems to be quiet. Survivors are still waiting for answers. There are no consequences for those who carried out these disgusting acts. Six months have passed now and the board of St. John Ambulance Ireland remains largely the same. Judge Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's recommendations still have not been implemented. The two long-standing board members who were meant to resign still have not. One left, and the other is now the interim chair. That seems like another kick in the teeth for survivors. I was talking to Mick about this last week, and we were saying there seems to be a disparity within our society regarding people from socio-economically deprived and disadvantaged areas in that they are not worthy of the same support from the State, despite crying out and asking for help. There is that real sense, when survivors start looking at other examples of abuse and how it was treated, that they feel if they were from a different class, they would be treated differently. It is an important thing, and it is important we hear those concerns of survivors. All survivors want is real accountability, and every member that was a senior officer on the board to step down and let the good, honest and hard-working volunteers take over, and let them continue to do the good work that the organisation has done in this country for well over 100 years. Only then will survivors accept and acknowledge that accountability has taken place. The survivors and I do not feel that there has been any accountability. There have been no consequences for the perpetrators, the organisation and the culture within that organisation. Despite the recent resignation, there remains people on the board of St. John Ambulance Ireland who were not only aware of what was going on, but had even adapted lyrics of popular songs at the time to mock the children being abused in the old Kilmainham ambulance division in Dolphin's Barn.	spk_385

Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-10-11	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 4: General (Resumed)	dbsect_18	People from across the sporting community tuned in yesterday to follow the budget announcements and to hear what support and investment sport and recreation would get in 2024, only to be bewildered and left wondering where was the support for which the sporting sector had been calling. This budget has made it clear that sport and recreation is not even on the radar when it comes to priorities for Fine Gael, the Green Party and Fianna Fáil. Year after year, Ireland has had the lowest level of investment in sport and recreation across the entire EU and this budget has ensured Ireland will stay at the bottom of the list. Simply put, in comparison with the rest of the EU, sport in Ireland is neglected. As a result, improvements in levels of participation in sport are either stagnant or moving at a snail's pace. Worst of all, we are seeing the harsh impact of the cost-of-living crisis on children. Barnardos has said that nearly one quarter of parents have had to stop or reduce their child's sporting activities due to rising costs. This was reinforced in the Irish Sports Monitor's annual report, which painted a clear picture of growing inequality in sport. Children are paying the harsh price for this Government's neglect of sport and recreation. Sinn Féin would provide our sporting community with the respect it deserves. We would introduce a leisure card that would make sport more affordable and accessible to children across the State. The leisure card scheme would drive up participation and support families during this cost-of-living crisis.We would increase capital funding for sports facilities, providing communities with the modern sports facilities they urgently need. Sport and recreation are crucial to society and vital to our social fabric. It is about time sport and recreation were shown the respect and support they deserve. 	spk_157
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-10-04	dail	33	An Garda Síochána: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this really important motion, and the Minister for coming in and listening to the debate.This Government claims it is committed to stronger and safer communities and that it is committed to a strengthened and well-resourced Garda force. Yet, after decades of Fine Gael at the helm of the Department of Justice I see little or no evidence to back up that claim. In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, we have lost more than 100 gardaí in the past four years. That is a huge blow to inner city security. The loss of so many gardaí in the city centre is having a crippling effect on the policing of the city centre. Over the years I have watched the hard work of community gardaí in Pearse Street, Kevin Street and Ringsend. I have watched the strong relationship that community gardaí have fostered with communities and the positive impact it has had. Community gardaí are an immensely valuable resource in the inner city. Since 2020 Pearse Street Garda station has gone from having 28 community gardaí to just 20, but now because of the new roster Pearse Street is set to lose another one third of the community gardaí. This is going to be a devastating blow to community policing in the inner city. The superintendent in Pearse Street is very good. He is really engaged with the local community and he is very professional, as are all the gardaí that I meet, day in and day out, but he does not have the resources available to him that he requires. The Garda do not have the resources they need. It must be demoralising for gardaí, yet they go above and beyond for the local community day in and day out. We cannot tolerate the abandonment of local communities due to Fine Gael's neglect of An Garda Síochána for more than a decade. Last night I got calls and images of violence and fires being lit just off Pearse Street. Communities are being terrorised by these gangs. The Garda does not have the resources it needs and the streets are not safe. They do not feel safe for people living in the south inner city. Increasingly, we hear accounts of people avoiding the city centre. It is not just the people visiting the city, it is the inner city community itself.	spk_35

Like everybody in the House, I continuously have parents ringing my office looking for advice, support and help to find a place in childcare in their local community. Parents are desperate to find childcare. Most have conceded that affordable childcare in Dublin is impossible to find. The sky-high childcare fees and lack of places means that a whole section of society is being locked out of employment. At a time the Government is meant to be working for increased general equality, in reality what we are seeing is inequality increasing as more mothers are forced to stay at home. They are being denied the opportunity to return to a profession or education. This is a result of the Government's continued failure to deliver affordable childcare.  We are witnessing a substantial cohort of workers being locked out of the workplace. There is no doubt that this is causing severe damage to our economy and society. The hands-off approach of the Government has failed and, as a result, workers and their families are being left to pay the price. We are fortunate that in Dublin Bay South there are some brilliant community childcare facilities such as Ringsend and Irishtown Community Centre and St. Andrew's Resource Centre. I speak to the services regularly and they are demoralised by the amount of paperwork, box ticking and inspections that are taking place. The amount of work they have to put in does not ensure that children are being cared for. Childcare facilities do amazing work and are the heart of the community. They are a core element of building community and provide a valuable resource.	spk_157

Earlier this week, I extended an invitation to the GRA to come to Leinster House to give a cross-party briefing on the realities facing front-line gardaí and to ensure that their voices were heard. Community policing is vital in the inner city, but as a result of the new roster, it is being skinned to the bone. This is not acceptable. Front-line gardaí have told me that the number of community gardaí has been reduced by one third in preparation for the new roster. This will damage the Garda’s impact locally and set back years of hard work by community gardaí in the inner city. Will the Government intervene, stand up for front-line workers and protect community policing?	spk_328

In August of this year, the Tánaiste said he wanted Ireland to be the best country in Europe in which to be a child. Those comments ring hollow for children with spina bifida and scoliosis. Courtney Manning, a disability advocate, was supposed to be having surgery this week. She now has no consultant, plan or answers. Courtney only has stress and pain. The Government clearly has no urgency and no plan. Sophie Redmond, who is now 14, went through multiple surgeries to address her chronic back pain. It seems that Sophie is not one of the 19 but she and her family and families like them want, deserve and need answers. They must be wondering whether they can trust the system. That is a crucial aspect of all this. Trust has been lost by the Government. That is why the terms of reference need to be expanded beyond the current narrow focus. These parents are worried beyond belief and they cannot be left in limbo. They need answers as soon as possible. There are 314 children currently waiting on spinal surgery. That is up six on the last report and it is climbing steadily. In the context of meeting with parents, it is not good enough to take an approach of squeezing them in this Friday. Parents must be included in setting the terms of reference for the next review. The families must be at the centre of deciding on the terms of reference. The terms of reference must be widened and parents must have confidence. Parents and families must be at the front of the bus. Deputy Durkan referred to the need to give families hope. We need to give them more than that. We need to give them action and a commitment that they can trust the system, it will get them out of their pain and we will deliver a genuine health service that works for children and young people, rather than leaving them in pain, which is what is happening now.	spk_138

In recent weeks we have watched fuel and prices steadily increase. Petrol and diesel prices have increased by 7.6% and 9% respectively. This Government seems hell-bent on ensuring fuel prices hit the €2 mark as soon as possible. This Government is planning two fuel price hikes in October and that these price hikes are not happening in isolation. They are happening in the middle of the cost-of-living crisis and they are suffocating workers. These price hikes need to be stopped. It is ordinary workers and pensioners and vulnerable members of our society who will feel the brunt of these price hikes most. Some commentators say these price hikes are needed to push more people to buy electrical vehicles and to push people to cycle in active transport. The reality is that for the average person in Ireland an electric car is beyond their means. In the past year, the price of an electric car has jumped by 13% and, as a result, an electric car in Ireland now costs an average of €65,000. That is an enormous sum of money for ordinary people in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. Last week I spoke to a young mother who works as a healthcare worker in a hospital here in Dublin. She told me why she does not use public transport despite having the choice. She said that to drive to hospital takes her 20 minutes versus over an hour on the bus. Getting public transport every day for her would add more than seven hours a week to her commute. We need to see this Government delivering efficient public transport so that we can ease the congestion we are seeing across the city and start improving the quality of life for those living in the city. Many communities across my constituency, like Pearse Street and Kevin Street, experience constant traffic congestion throughout the day. Many times of the day these streets are like car parks simply because the Government and Dublin City Council have failed to put in effective public transport. The city council slowing down the lights will simply not work.	spk_372

Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-09-21	dail	33	Local Authorities	dbsect_40	I was just going to say that. It is a nationwide issue. I am sure the Minister of State is aware that Fórsa members in local authorities across the State are in the middle of industrial action. As a public representative, I have seen first hand over the years the brilliant work the estate managers and area officers do for and across communities in my constituency. I know the pressure they are under. For instance, when estate managers are moved or move themselves or go off sick, there is no replacement for them. They are under pressure on the front line. They deal with residents in local authority housing across the city in public and private housing. Fórsa estimates that there has been a loss of 10,000 jobs from this sector over a number of years. That is how under-resourced local government is, including Dublin City Council and, as the Ceann Comhairle said, across the State. The issue at the core of this dispute is simple, it is how the management of local authorities has refused to engage on this and have allowed this to go on. It is beyond me. This should have been addressed a long time ago. During the years of the harsh austerity measures, these workers stepped up and took on increased responsibilities and duties. Workers are seeking that the increased duties they have accepted be formally recognised. A job evaluation scheme is a practice already common across Europe and in the North of Ireland. The health and higher education sectors in the South have already brought in this scheme. It is a process of evaluating each post, the responsibilities of the post and the worth of the post. We have seen the success of this scheme elsewhere; I cannot understand why local government management is refusing to implement the scheme. We must ensure that workers are given a fair and transparent process to evaluate their roles and ensure proper grading. It should be made clear that this dispute is a result of the Local Government Management Agency refusing to enter negotiations with Fórsa, as was recommended by the WRC in January. We need to see meaningful engagement from the local management agency with the union. The workers have overwhelmingly voted for industrial action up to and including strike action. This is having a harsh impact on vulnerable members of our community. The Government cannot take a spectator's role in this dispute between the workers and local government management. Will the Minister and the Government intervene to bring about a fair solution that shows these workers are valued and respected?	spk_427
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-09-21	dail	33	Local Authorities	dbsect_40	I agree that this affects all of us in the House. It is an important issue because, like Deputy Collins said, vulnerable people contact us. The reality is that management seems to be sitting on its hands and is content to allow this dispute to escalate. Staff levels are depleted - estate managers who work on the front line are not being replaced for months. That is the case in my constituency. The people to suffer are the residents in local authority housing and flat complexes in particular. It is the residents who are being made to suffer. The reality is that management appears to be sitting on its hands. It does not want a resolution to this particular dispute. Dublin City Council has also overseen some of the worst neglect I have ever witnessed. The conditions in which some of the tenants are living in local authority housing is appalling. The conditions are not acceptable and the neglect is ongoing. I have raised the issue in the House on numerous occasions of the shocking conditions in which residents are living and the neglect people in the south and north inner city are facing.There is dampness in flats, raw sewage, gas and other leaks, electrical faults and rat infestations. The list goes on. As the Minister of State pointed out, it is neither he nor I who will be affected. Rather, it is the residents, who are facing more neglect. Management needs to be proactive on this matter, as does the Government. The Government cannot be seen as a bystander on this issue, leaving vulnerable city council tenants to face the current situation alone.	spk_429

I am sure the Minister of State is aware that Fórsa members in local authorities across the State are in the middle of industrial action. As a public representative, I have seen first hand over the years the brilliant work the estate managers and area officers do for and across communities in my constituency. I know the pressure they are under. For instance, when estate managers are moved or move themselves or go off sick, there is no replacement for them. They are under pressure on the front line. They deal with residents in local authority housing across the city in public and private housing. Fórsa estimates that there has been a loss of 10,000 jobs from this sector over a number of years. That is how under-resourced local government is, including Dublin City Council and, as the Ceann Comhairle said, across the State. The issue at the core of this dispute is simple, it is how the management of local authorities has refused to engage on this and have allowed this to go on. It is beyond me. This should have been addressed a long time ago. During the years of the harsh austerity measures, these workers stepped up and took on increased responsibilities and duties. Workers are seeking that the increased duties they have accepted be formally recognised. A job evaluation scheme is a practice already common across Europe and in the North of Ireland. The health and higher education sectors in the South have already brought in this scheme. It is a process of evaluating each post, the responsibilities of the post and the worth of the post. We have seen the success of this scheme elsewhere; I cannot understand why local government management is refusing to implement the scheme. We must ensure that workers are given a fair and transparent process to evaluate their roles and ensure proper grading. It should be made clear that this dispute is a result of the Local Government Management Agency refusing to enter negotiations with Fórsa, as was recommended by the WRC in January. We need to see meaningful engagement from the local management agency with the union. The workers have overwhelmingly voted for industrial action up to and including strike action. This is having a harsh impact on vulnerable members of our community. The Government cannot take a spectator's role in this dispute between the workers and local government management. Will the Minister and the Government intervene to bring about a fair solution that shows these workers are valued and respected?	spk_427
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-09-21	dail	33	Local Authorities	dbsect_44	I agree that this affects all of us in the House. It is an important issue because, like Deputy Collins said, vulnerable people contact us. The reality is that management seems to be sitting on its hands and is content to allow this dispute to escalate. Staff levels are depleted - estate managers who work on the front line are not being replaced for months. That is the case in my constituency. The people to suffer are the residents in local authority housing and flat complexes in particular. It is the residents who are being made to suffer. The reality is that management appears to be sitting on its hands. It does not want a resolution to this particular dispute. Dublin City Council has also overseen some of the worst neglect I have ever witnessed. The conditions in which some of the tenants are living in local authority housing is appalling. The conditions are not acceptable and the neglect is ongoing. I have raised the issue in the House on numerous occasions of the shocking conditions in which residents are living and the neglect people in the south and north inner city are facing.There is dampness in flats, raw sewage, gas and other leaks, electrical faults and rat infestations. The list goes on. As the Minister of State pointed out, it is neither he nor I who will be affected. Rather, it is the residents, who are facing more neglect. Management needs to be proactive on this matter, as does the Government. The Government cannot be seen as a bystander on this issue, leaving vulnerable city council tenants to face the current situation alone.	spk_429
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-07-13	dail	33	Planning and Development (Provision of Public Housing) Bill 2023: First Stage	dbsect_32	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act Bill to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 and to repeal section 97(3)(b).The purpose of this Bill is simple. It is stated in the Title. It is to ensure and protect the provision of public housing. Where this is particularly relevant is in dense urban areas. The Part V exemption of section 97(3)(b) should have been scrapped when the previous Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage removed the height restrictions in the city. To be clear, we have no issue with exempting small sites that are being developed to supply four or five homes. This Bill would not affect such developments. However, when we see large developments of up to 50 units in respect of which exemption from providing public housing is being sought, it is clear that the existing legislation is flawed. In 2020, I introduced other legislation aimed at tackling the abuse of this loophole. That was rejected by Government. I was told then that the reason why it was rejected was because the example I gave was an isolated incident where there was an application for a large building with multiple units on a very small site of 0.1 ha.The Minister said legislation could not be made based on a one-off development. I understood that. However since then I have seen the continual use of this loophole by developers seeking to avoid their Part 5 obligation. I represent communities which are experiencing the worse side of the housing crisis. Families are living in damp, overcrowded conditions in accommodation that really is only fit to be condemned and pulled down. I see the neglect of tenants in social housing right across the city of Dublin. I speak to my constituents in Dublin Bay South, where I can see the standard of accommodation in the south inner city and the neglect by Dublin City Council. The reality is, that Dublin City Council's record in the south-east inner city in dealing with public and social housing is an absolute shambles. The way the council treats residents and tenants of public housing is absolutely abysmal. There are infestations of rats and mould, damp and flooding. It is just unacceptable in this day and age. Communities are continually being promised regeneration. Pearse House has been promised regeneration for many years now and the progress on that is glacial. Communities in areas like Ringsend, Pearse Street, and Kevin Street are the heart of this city. These communities are facing neglect and the public - ordinary working families - are being priced out of housing in the inner city. We are seeing a generation of people being forced to abandon the community they know and in which they grew up, in order to try to find a home. It is ordinary people who make this city. Without them, Dublin will be, and would be, a shell of a city. We need to amend the legislation to ensure public housing is delivered in communities most under pressure. I will mention a number of communities that are under pressure. There are 3,500 homes going on the Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend. There are talks about affordable housing. It does not appear the homes on this site are going to be affordable. It is hard to understand but the speculation is that the cost of units in the Irish Glass Bottle will be €500,000 to €600,000 each. The Government had an opportunity because the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, owned 20% of the share in the strategic development zone, SDZ. If that had been transferred to Dublin City Council, it could have made the homes truly affordable. However, the Government and NAMA have overseen the sale of that 20% stake in the SDZ to be sold off to the developer Johnny Ronan. It means there is huge uncertainty over the affordability of these homes and the Government really needs to intervene, meet with and talk to residents and explain what is going to happen.	spk_303

Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-07-13	dail	33	Situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory: Statements	dbsect_33	"I welcome the Dáil allocating time to address the unfolding horror we are seeing in Palestine due to the violence by Israel. It has been several years since I visited the Gaza Strip, but the destruction I witnessed then will never leave me. Gaza is actually an open-air prison. There is the wall that stops any movement, whether that is people coming or people going. People are only permitted to go a few kilometres out to sea. F-16 fighter jets fly overhead regularly and bombs are frequently dropped on sites in the Gaza Strip. I was recently invited to take part in a conference in Ramallah on the great crime of the Nakba. There is one simple reason why I cannot attend. It is because the apartheid government of Israel has barred me from entering Israel or Palestine. The reason I am barred is because, along with other activists, I was part of a flotilla that was bringing humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. When we were on the boat during that journey, I was taken hostage, along with the other activists, by the Israeli special forces. We were held at gunpoint for a number of hours, until we were brought to the port of Ashdod, where we were then imprisoned for more than a week by the apartheid Israelis. Does that sound like a ""vibrant democracy""? Does the Government not challenge the President of the EU Commission's description of the state of Israel? Ursula von der Leyen described Israel as a vibrant democracy that made the desert bloom. It is hard to understand how anybody could stand over that. For an EU official to use such racist tropes and to face no repercussions shows all that is wrong with the Commission. While I welcome the time the Dáil has allocated to address the brutal system of apartheid that Israel is inflicting on the Palestinian people, it does deeply frustrate me that despite how vocal dozens of Members of the Dáil, across all parties, have been on these crimes, we see no action from the Government, bar the odd statement of condemnation. The Tánaiste talks about maintaining a consensus. The difficulty is that the consensus is one that believes Israel is good and Palestinians are bad; that Israel is a friendly state to the EU and that the state of Palestine is not worth backing. That is the reality. The consensus in the EU is that when it comes to Palestine and Palestinians, it is not worth taking a stand for human rights. Human rights breaches happen daily and weekly. The Israeli Minister, Mr. Ben-Gvir, is a racist, who is encouraging the settlers to inflict more and more violence on Palestinians. What will it take for this Government to use its position in Europe and say enough is enough; that it is time to stop arming and empowering an apartheid government? The EU Commission views Israel as a friend and ally. That is the consensus. Ireland must say that Israel is not a friend. It is not an ally. We must tell Israel and tell the EU that we are going to take an independent stand; that we are not going to go along with the consensus any more. Perhaps it is time the Commission did what any decent friend would do, which is to tell apartheid Israel some home truths. It should tell Israel that it is an apartheid state and that the EU does not want to be friends with a government built on racism and hatred; that the EU will not be friends or allies with a government built on a brutal system of apartheid. It is time to stop this brutality and to start treating Palestinians as equals."	spk_311
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-07-13	dail	33	Dereliction and Building Regeneration Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_42	"I thank all the staff for their support and professionalism throughout this term. The need to streamline the CPO process has been mentioned. This is really important because the process is not user-friendly, certainly not in Dublin City Council. Limerick was mentioned as being an exemplar in terms of dealing with derelict sites. Dublin City Council is particularly poor at dealing with derelict sites. I know of five units very close to here that have been empty for years. The entire street is effectively empty. It is in an area where there is the possibility of very high rents. They are building up to ten or 11 storeys everywhere around it yet on Townsend Street, which is not too far from here, there are four or five units that are lying derelict. There is no life in the street and it takes down the energy of the street. When I first looked at the Bill, I saw the words ""dereliction"" and ""regeneration"" and thought it would be really welcome to see a discussion on the neglect, dereliction and need for regeneration of Dublin City Council flat complexes. We are talking about dereliction. Dublin City Council has neglected the residents of these complexes and social housing across the inner city to a criminal level. Examples include rats, flooding, raw sewage being pumped out on to balconies, the lack of cleaning, bins and the bin storage not being maintained properly and the lack of estate managers. Dublin City Council's neglect of inner-city Dublin is criminal. If private residences were in the same condition, there would be outrage, laws would be brought in and there would be debates here but because it involves Dublin City Council tenants, they are treated really poorly, which is very unfair. I was once in Leo Fitzgerald House, which is not too far from here. When you go up to the top balcony, it is like a prison with the spikes and barriers. It is horrendous. There are 200 flats in Markievicz House and right on the corner of that development is a site that has been derelict for years and is the source of rats that are plaguing residents in one part of Markievicz House. Dublin City Council should have three estate managers.At one stage, there were no estate managers dealing with the flat complexes. Of course, there is going to be neglect because they are not putting the resources in or the proper management that identifies these issues and does something about them. People being allowed to live in these conditions is completely unacceptable. It is not just in the very heart of the inner city. We are talking about flat complexes in Rathmines, Beech Hill in Donnybrook, in Ringsend and on Bishop Street. While we are talking about neglect, dereliction and regeneration, a couple of years ago it was announced that there would be regeneration of Pearse House. The redevelopment of this is glacial and it is unacceptable that people are allowed live in these conditions and in this uncertainty. Five or six years ago, St. Andrew's Court, again very close to here, was proposed for regeneration and redevelopment. It was proposed that it would be knocked and rebuilt. A private developer has built 21 apartments, which he finished two years ago, and there are people living in them. The council is still faffing around with plans for regeneration of that site. I criticise the council but ultimately the buck stops with Government and with the Minister. The Government has neglected those living in the inner city. I would be more than happy to accompany the Minister of State to any of the flats and show him the conditions. There is a young woman who had breast cancer who keeps her flat spotless and yet there is raw sewage coming out of the pipes and running down her balcony. There are condoms, hair and wipes all coming out onto the balcony and that has been going on for nearly a month. It is like the council just does not care; it really just does not care. It says it will send someone out but you will never see them. If someone does come out, they say they will be back, but they do not come back. This young woman has gone through enough. That is the way most tenants are treated. They are treated abysmally and then they are expected to pay extortionate rents in some instances. What do they get for it? They get neglect and dereliction. That needs to be addressed. I have raised this issue many a time. I have looked to raise it at various levels here and to have a debate around dereliction of the flat complexes and of the inner city. We are all talk about the need for a revitalised city. We are not going to do it if we do not have decent accommodation for those living in the inner city. I thank the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach. I know I went off tack but I hope everybody enjoys the recess."	spk_379
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-07-12	dail	33	Investment in Football: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_10	I welcome this important motion. Deputy Ó Ríordáin captured the romance of football. I send my well wishes to the women’s football team, in particular Abbie Larkin, who is from the heart of football in Ringsend, in the Women’s World Cup, which is starting on 20 July. League of Ireland football is in a good place, but that will stop being the case if we do not invest in it. The FAI’s investment proposal is welcome. Crucially, it is based on evidence, namely, an audit of the current infrastructure. I welcome that, under the plans, 50% of the funds will go to grassroots football. It is important the Government would carry out a long-overdue national sports facilities audit. From this, we would have a national sports facilities strategy. This would mean facilities for all sports would be developed where they were needed as opposed to being based on the profile of the club or current ministerial preferences. It would also mean facilities would not be dependent on clubs having deep pockets. A sports facilities strategy would avoid a situation where the county of Wexford would have no full-sized 11-a-side AstroTurf pitch. It would mean we would not have ten counties with no full-sized hockey pitches. Sinn Féin published our national sports facilities strategy, which set out clearly the need to provide facilities in the communities that required them, not in the communities that simply lobbied the best. We need to reform the sports capital grant programme. It is weighted against working-class clubs and benefits more affluent clubs. For example, clubs need large savings to pay for projects upfront before they can draw down grants. As a result, some clubs have to take out loans. Other clubs may never be able to draw down grants because they do not have the savings to spend upfront. A large number of football and other sports clubs do not have their own grounds and so cannot apply for the sports capital grant. Of Dublin’s football clubs, 73% do not have their own facilities. Clubs in less affluent areas do not find it as easy to access professional services as affluent clubs do. Ireland is bottom in terms of European investment in sport. If we were in a league, we would have been relegated long ago. Sinn Féin supports an increase in investment in domestic football. Any such increase would be funded through the Exchequer rather than any specific revenue stream. Therefore, the economic impact of any proposal to increase a specific revenue stream should be analysed closely. Football is not the only sport that has seen underinvestment. All sports have, and we must change that. We need to invest in all sports and all sports must be treated equally, including having equal access to sports funding based on the needs of the public, not on political needs and political expediency. We need to create a football industry. Irish football needs to be professionalised so that it can generate the bulk of its own income. If we invest in Irish football and professionalise the sport, we will create jobs in football and attract interest and investment into it. When the film industry was on its knees, the State invested in it. Today, it is thriving. The State needs to do the same for Irish football. The high-tech industry was and is supported by the State. The same must be done for Irish football. We need to introduce the leisure card scheme to address the rising cost barrier to participation. A recent report found that 20% of children had either stopped or reduced participation in sport due to the cost of living. A leisure card scheme would support these families and help to keep children involved in sport. Through increased participation, sports clubs will increase their funding.	spk_28
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-07-12	dail	33	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_20	I thank the Minister of State for being present to listen to us as we critique the recent EU Council meeting. Some two weeks ago here in this Chamber we heard in pre-EU Council meeting statements from several Deputies condemning the brutal actions of apartheid Israel and the murderous rampage it is waging on the Palestinian people. We asked that this condemnation be echoed at the Council meeting. Deputies spoke of the need for Ireland to assert its voice as one for peace on the Council and for Ireland to stand against the EU sprint towards mass militarisation. When we look at the post-meeting report, all we see is a commitment to further militarisation. There is not a single mention of addressing the brutal escalation of violence by apartheid Israel. In fact, the only mention of Israel is in the context of how to strengthen EU-Israel relations. It is clear from this why Ursula von der Leyen is highly tipped to take over as head of NATO. This is a reward for her clear commitment to ramping up the militarisation of the EU, for her helping to create an even bigger market for the military-industrial complex to profit from and for her ensuring that the EU will not stand in the way of arming rogue terror states like apartheid Israel. By the sounds of it, Ireland will also get its kickback for nodding politely as the EU heads down this destructive road. It appears that senior officials, elected representatives and Ministers are updating their CVs. That may explain why there is a push against neutrality. It might also explain why there is no resistance to the terror that Israel inflicts on Palestine day by day.	spk_258

This Bill is the product of engagement with autism advocacy groups such as Involve Autism and Neurodiversity – Irishtown, Ringsend and Pearse Street. There is a strong feeling among parents of autistic children that their voice is not being heard by school boards of management. This Bill would go some way towards correcting that imbalance. In many schools across the country, children with autism are transported out of their communities to schools that are great distances from their homes because the required numbers of class places are not available. This problem is particularly acute in south Dublin and Dublin 6W. In Dublin 2 and Dublin 4, the picture is not much better for autistic children. Regularly, there is resistance to opening autism places in schools, and this is replicated right around the country. The Bill would strengthen the voice of those with autism on the boards of schools. It would also mean issues relating to autistic children would have to be raised at board level. In bringing the Bill together, we consulted a range of stakeholders, including principals of many schools, AsIAm, Neurodiversity – Irishtown, Ringsend and Pearse Street, Alan Power of Involve Autism, and the National Council for Special Education. The Department of Education officials were particularly helpful. I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Madigan, who has done considerable work and is clearly committed to improving the lot of children with autism. I acknowledge the work of all involved. This Bill would not solve every problem but would be an important step in strengthening the rights of autistic children and their families. We all understand the challenge faced by autistic children in the school setting, so it is important that their voice be heard clearly at school board meetings.	spk_252

Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-06-28	dail	33	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_19	The agenda of the upcoming European Council meeting paints a grim picture of where priorities lie.It clearly shows the one-directional path the EU has chosen to follow, which is a pathway of increased militarisation across the Euro zone. With talk of the EU defence capacity in terms of the procurement, investment and production of weapons in 2021, the EU exported in excess of €179 billion worth of arms. We should be working to reduce, not increase, arms exports. I assume at this meeting there will be no mention of the deadly use of the EU-made weapons on civilians, The indiscriminate use of EU weapons in Palestine has led to death, injury, and loss of limbs of countless civilians. Thirty-nine children have been murdered by apartheid Israel this year so far. Israel clearly violates laws surrounding arms trade but yet the weapons keep on flowing in. Two weeks ago, we saw five killed in Jenin and more than 80 injured. Ambulances rushing to help the injured were targeted by Israeli forces, which is another violation of international law. When will we see Ireland as a neutral state, using its voice on the European Council as a voice for peace? For decades Ireland was to the fore as a mediator in conflict, working for peaceful solutions, but that voice of Ireland has been silent for too long. We are hiding behind the pretence that Europe is restricting our taking a principled stand on the mayhem, apartheid and terrorism Israel is imposing on Palestinian people. As an aside, apartheid Israel is where the Irish record goal scorer Robbie Keane is going to manage a football team, Maccabi Tel Aviv. This same state has murdered four children on a beach in the Gaza Strip and has led to the blocking of children coming to Ireland with Gaza Action Ireland to play sport right across the country - the same state that has imposed terror and apartheid. It is recognised by B'Tselem and Amnesty International that Israel is an apartheid state and I ask Robbie Keane to reconsider his decision.	spk_181

Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-06-21	dail	33	Youth Justice Strategy: Statements	dbsect_18	I welcome the national youth justice strategy. There are changes that we in Sinn Féin would make. Detention should be considered for juveniles or young people convicted of serious crimes such as sex offences, murder and manslaughter. That said, early intervention is key. The strategy acknowledges many offenders will have multiple disadvantages. Socioeconomic status is one such disadvantage, and my constituency has many people who face socioeconomic disadvantage daily. It is important to acknowledge that we will not police our way out of the challenges that face communities in the inner city. We have a great local Garda force. Pearse Street and Kevin Street Garda stations are really helpful and very professional, and they are very patient in the face of much provocation. Resources really are lacking where Garda numbers are concerned. The superintendent in Pearse Street, Mr. Dermot McKenna, engages very closely with local residents and tries to ensure there is no glaring lack of resources. Along with an increase in Garda resources, there needs to be greater employment opportunities for less affluent inner-city communities. Also needed are greater educational opportunities. Legislation is also needed to tackle socioeconomic issues. This process could have been started some months ago when Deputy Wynne and I introduced legislation to address and tackle socioeconomic disadvantage and outlaw discrimination. Unfortunately, the Government is dragging its heels. The Minister has said he hopes the legislation will be in place before the end of the life of this Government. I am not as convinced but I believe it is really important. To be fair to the Minister, he has acknowledged this. I hope he will back up his words of several months ago with deeds and ensure the legislation is enacted before the end of the lifetime of this Government. At City Quay in the Pearse Street area, there is a youth club called Talk About Youth that does absolutely fantastic work for the young people but does not have an own-door facility. It has to rent space when it wants to work with the young people and it does not always rent it in the same building. It has to go here and there, or wherever it can find the space to rent, to do the work with the young people in the south inner city. The Government should act further on the findings in the Mulvey report and extend to the south inner city the resources that followed the report. The reality is that the north and south inner-city areas are one community, albeit divided by a river. Now, unfortunately, because of Government actions, the community has been divided on the basis of resources available to community and youth groups, and that is a huge issue. People would say there are issues affecting the north inner city but they affect the south inner city equally. The lack of resources, educational opportunities and job opportunities, combined with the neglect of flat complexes and public housing in the south inner city, adds to the disconnect between young people and their local community and society. The flats are neglected and the conditions are shocking. I was in a flat complex not far from here today. In the stairwell, the smell of stagnant water, urine and Jeyes Fluid was absolutely sickening. There were bars and razor wire along the tops of the flats. It looked more like Mountjoy Prison but I would imagine that is being unfair to Mountjoy. I invite every Minister to come down to the flats to see the neglect residents have to put up with. We can have in place all the strategies and plans we want but nothing will change unless they are backed up with resources.	spk_232
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-06-20	dail	33	LGBTQI+ Equality: Statements	dbsect_17	"I welcome this opportunity to speak on this very important matter. When walking around Dublin this month, we can see an increase in levels of pride and visibility for our LGBTQI+ community. In the inner city over the years, we have seen some brilliant community Pride festivals happening. Notably last year, this was the case in Pearse House, in Ringsend and in Kevin Street. There is a real, ""what it says on the tin"" Pride in the community. Pride is a festival of inclusion and visibility, but also defiance. It marks the anniversary of when the community of Stonewall rose up against the harassment and discrimination the LGBT community was enduring. Irish society has been continually developing into a more welcoming, open and inclusive society. Recently, however, I saw a video that went around of a young LGBTQI+ individual who was savagely beaten by other young individuals. Like everybody else, I was really shocked by this. What was more shocking about that incident for me, if this was even possible, was the age profile of the young people who inflicted this brutal attack on the individual concerned. I always see my own kids and young people generally as being much more tolerant, accepting, inclusive and progressive, so it was frightening to see the age profile of those involved. Sometimes you think that maybe we are not in as good a position as we might think we are. We cannot, therefore, take for granted the work we need to do. In the context of events such as the attack I have described, we must ensure young people are made aware that this is about encouraging inclusivity and diversity. That video, as I said, was horrific for everyone to see. Equally, the age profile of those young people who carried out the attack was scary and counter to what I believed was young people's understanding of diversity.  Irish society has been developing, though, and homosexuality was decriminalised 30 years ago this month. We are now eight years on from when Irish people voted ""Yes"" to equality. While Ireland continues to become more progressive and forward-looking, we are lagging in the area of LGBTQ+ inclusion in sports. Research from the Gaelic Players Association is encouraging. Some 99% of elite players would accept a teammate coming out. Other questions that arose in the research, however, in respect of players' awareness of other players who have come out, are concerning. A total of 65% of females stated they were aware of an openly gay teammate. Let us compare this to male teammates, only 10% of whom said they were aware of an openly gay teammate. Looking at the League of Ireland as an example, we do not see any openly gay individual playing in its premier division, while there may only be one person in the first division. Clearly, then, there is an issue in men's sport. I do not know the reasons for this, but women are certainly much more open in this regard. I refer to the competitiveness of male sport, but I honestly do not know what the answer here is. Perhaps someone can enlighten me. Research provided by Sporting Pride sheds light on the harrowing experience of the LGBT community's involvement in sports. Some 75% have experienced or witnessed homophobia in sports, 49% of incidents are perpetrated by teammates and 20% of LGBTQ+ people avoid participating in sport because they are part of the LGBTQ+ community. These are shocking statistics that show the urgent need for strong and meaningful diversity and inclusion policies across sporting national governing bodies, NGBs. It is the voices of those in the LGBT community, who are most likely to experience barriers to inclusion, that should be at the forefront of developing diversity and inclusion policies."	spk_146
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-06-13	dail	33	Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_11	This Bill aims to ensure the tobacco industry is prevented from monopolising the market in tobacco and nicotine inhaling products. It will promote public health, public safety and consumer welfare. We welcome the Bill. It would have been more beneficial to have introduced it a number of years ago. However, as the saying goes, we are where we are. By introducing stricter regulations on the sale, advertising and marketing of these products, it will restrict access to hazardous substances. I recently heard a consultant say the people using vaping devices are taking part in an experiment. In effect, vapers are guinea pigs because we do not yet know the effects of vaping. That has to be a concern and should be borne in mind. As Deputy Ward said, legislation is not enough. Public awareness and education must run in parallel in response to these issues in order that people can make an informed decision regarding their health. By educating people on the dangers of using tobacco and nicotine, they can be encouraged to make healthier decisions and receive support if they fall victim to addiction. To support a healthier lifestyle for citizens, we must acknowledge and address the underlying problems and work towards an effective strategy. Additionally, the Bill acknowledges that new vaping devices and e-cigarettes are being introduced. These products will have to meet strict regulation requirements, including restricted-selling labelling and safety requirements. That is really important. The way the products look, including their colours, brightness and glitz, is a huge attraction to everyone, not just young people. Some vape products are marketed in ways that attract non-smokers. It may not be politically correct to say it but I have noticed that the number of young women who did not previously smoke but are now using these flavoured vape products seems to be increasing. It is hard to understand what the attraction is other than the good marketing associated with the products and the fact there is some addictive element to them. Young people especially seem to be attracted to vape devices such as those produced by Elf Bar. Many of the products are disposable, which means there are environmental consequences as well. One factor contributing to their attractiveness is the availability of enticing but misleading flavours such as birthday cake and cotton candy. As someone with a sweet tooth, such flavours would attract me. That practice absolutely must be stopped. The products are designed to copy enjoyable flavours and thereby release endorphins and all of that. Many people feel better when they have chocolate. I certainly do. People using these vaping devices feel the same. It is satisfying and the flavour is nice. Through mechanisms such as appealing to taste, the vape companies take advantage of young people by enticing them to buy their products. With stricter marketing regulations, we can diminish the influence of the tobacco and vape industry. There have been studies discussing the gateway effect of e-cigarettes in leading users to smoking, with the use of flavoured vape products eventually leading to tobacco addiction. By banning flavoured products, we can prevent the transition to tobacco use and in that way protect public health. The ongoing availability of tobacco products to new generations will always be synonymous with further deterioration of public health. Regulation provides a viable means of ensuring the protection of our communities. It is a long time since I was a young person. Therefore, I met with a group of young people to discuss this issue and find out what they think. They made a few points I thought were worth hearing. They pointed out that it is the responsibility of Oireachtas Members to step in and provide safeguards. It is their view that banning underage vaping promotes a healthier lifestyle and reduces the burden on the healthcare system. They pointed out the easy accessibility of vaping products and that enticing marketing leads to increased usage by teenagers. In their view, banning the sale of vaping products to people aged under 18 is essential. Under-18s, they noted, are a particularly vulnerable cohort as they fall much more easily into forming habits. They pointed out that under-18s are in a critical development period and are vulnerable to influence and addiction. Targeting prevention measures at under-18s can prevent habit formation and reduce the chance of further addiction. The young people feel this House has a responsibility to acknowledge the vulnerability of youth. Research they undertook showed the likelihood of developing a long-term addiction increases when individuals use tobacco during their adolescence. This Bill is welcome and essential. We can no longer allow vapers, including young people, to be guinea pigs for the large vaping and tobacco industry.	spk_124
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-06-01	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Engagement of Children in Criminal Activity) Bill 2023: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_34	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It is a sad reflection on society that so many children are being groomed into a life of crime. It is a shocking image of deterioration of communities. It is a clear reflection on many of the failings of Fine Gael over the past 12 years in government. Working communities have been abandoned and left behind at the mercy of thugs. Many of the families living in these communities feel like they are living under siege. Not only have these communities been failed, but also the rank and file members of the Garda have been failed by 12 years of Fine Gael in government. They have seen Garda numbers and resources reducing year-on-year in Dublin. The Government, like its predecessor, is failing front-line gardaí and emergency responders. Gardaí have been warning of the legal risk they face when responding to an emergency callout. It is unacceptable the members are left exposed to dangerous driving charges. It is also unacceptable that, in 2023, there is still no training for gardaí involved in pursuit. Now we have a garda facing potential charges for pursuing a crime gang that brought misery and terror to families and communities for years. What will the Government do to give emergency responders the necessary legal protections to carry out their job? It is demoralising for so many gardaí on the front line to know that they have to let many of these thugs escape. It is demoralising for the gardaí and for the local communities that they are supporting. Anyone living, or involved, in these communities can clearly see the increasing number of children being groomed by drug gangs as foot soldiers. For example, in Pearse House, young children, from the ages of 8, 9 and ten up, are being paid to smash up closed circuit television, CCTV, cameras and bring drugs from one location to another. Children aged ten, 11 and 12 are being paid to carry money from one location to another for these criminal gangs. The resources that the gardaí have available to them are inadequate for them to address the real dangers and concerns that communities have. Residents in Pearse House feel that they have been let down by the Government because of the lack of resources being put into communities. There was an issue where Dublin City Council put in CCTV all around the blocks in Pearse House. The children were paid to go up and drop blocks on the CCTV and smash them. That hinders the ability of the Garda and Dublin City Council to operate. Effectively, it is almost a no-go area for many families and children. It is demoralising because 98% or 99% of the people living in Pearse Street in that community are good decent hard-working people who worked throughout the pandemic. They were on the front line in the pandemic and they have been let down by the State. They have been let down by Government. These children are being exploited by these gangs to move and sell drugs because of their age. Many will end up leaving school early and will never get the opportunities in life that they deserve. I welcome this Bill but we must acknowledge that it alone will not be the solution. We cannot police our way out of the current crisis that communities are facing. It is part of the solution but we need to see local communities effectively resourced. Local communities benefit greatly from active community gardaí. We need to see increased support for community gardaí and an increase in youth diversion projects. The Proceeds of Crime (Investment in Disadvantaged Communities) (Amendment) Bill 2021, introduced by my colleague, Deputy Mark Ward, needs to be implemented. It has the potential to free up more money to support the communities that are suffering most at the hands of these gangs. In the north inner city, we saw the positive impact the Mulvey report has had. In the south inner city, we did not. All those increased resources and supports for the inner city stopped exactly at the River Liffey and the south inner city was forgotten about, despite the north and south inner city being very much one community.We have a fantastic youth group in the Pearse Street area called the Talk about Youth project. It is doing brilliant work engaging with young people in the area and that is having a positive impact but, again, it does not have the resources. It does not have its own facility and if it needs a facility in which to work with young people, it has to book it in advance. That is not the way in which any modern-day youth group should have to work. These youth groups need to be provided with dedicated facilities that will give them certainty and security and support the important work they do. We all know what needs to be done. If all the political parties and groups show some will and determination, we can start delivering the resources and supports that will protect children from these drugs gangs.	spk_315

They have been de-tenanted to get ready for the regeneration. However, overnight, without any communication with the residents, the council has decided to relet the empty flats at Glover Court. This will undoubtedly delay the regeneration process. Once again, residents of Glover Court are being treated like second-class citizens. The flats of St. Andrew's Court, Glover Court and Pearse House are monuments to the Government's failure and neglect of working-class communities.

Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-05-25	dail	33	Biodiversity Action: Statements	dbsect_37	It has been four years since a biodiversity emergency was declared in Ireland and the gradual destruction of our native landscape is showing no let-up. We must take bold steps to put a stop to this destruction and start the process of restoration. We are towards the bottom of the EU ranking when it comes to levels of forest cover among EU states and our UNESCO biosphere sites are neglected. The Minister of State indicated he was in Killarney last week and he would have seen for himself the challenges with regard to Sika deer and rhododendron, and that it is becoming increasingly bare. A strategy must urgently be put in place to remove invasive species from the biosphere. Our other UNESCO biosphere site, Dublin Bay, is subject to frequent abuse, with high volumes of raw sewage flowing into the bay. Earlier this month, David Turner from Sandymount sent me shocking footage of raw sewage being released straight onto Sandymount Strand, and scores of sanitary products and tissues were left on the beach. Not only is this doing harm to the biosphere of Dublin Bay, it is creating a health risk for many of the hundreds of people using that beach each day. It is demoralising for those involved in projects to support our biosphere. Dublin City Council has many of those projects and it is a very active and engaged participant in developing and protecting the biosphere. The complete lack of communication from Irish Water to the community is disgraceful. If an individual dumps sewage or waste like this, he rightly should face charges, but Irish Water seems to operate with a sense of entitlement that it is not accountable to anyone. As we approach the summer months, this lack of accountability must stop. We need to see meaningful engagement from Irish Water and Dublin City Council with the local community. How is it acceptable that in 2023 we continue to allow raw sewage to be released into this Dublin Bay biosphere? Dublin Bay has a vibrant community of users and sea swimming is immensely popular, with the Half Moon Swimming and Water Polo Club and, in Ringsend, two brilliant rowing clubs, Stella Maris Rowing Club and St. Patrick's, which are at the heart of the community.Members frequently contact me about raw sewage in the bay and its effect on their training. We have seen in the past that Ringsend wastewater treatment plant has failed to inform the public of large discharges of sewage. For the sake of Dublin Bay as a biosphere and the local community, we need to see accountability. We need to see a short-term and a medium-term engineering solution to ensure that parts of Dublin Bay do not turn into no-go areas. It is also important that we address the waterways of Irish Water and their condition. One does not have to go too far from here to see the Liffey, the Tolka and the Grand Canal and the condition they are in. It is hard to quantify the amount of waste that flows down those rivers and along the canal but thanks to Ringsend's Jimmy Murray, we do have some insight. Mr. Murray set up the Liffey Sweeper project. I am not sure if the Minister of State has heard of it but the aim of the project is to try to stop the waste that is flowing down the Liffey from reaching Dublin Bay. From just 11 sampling trips undertaken by the Liffey Sweeper project along the river, a total of 4,114 kg of debris was extracted, the vast majority of which could be recycled. Had the Liffey Sweeper teams not been out on those days, thousands more kilograms of waste would be out in Dublin Bay now. Projects like the Liffey Sweeper need to be supported and expanded so that they can cover more waterways and they need to be in place on a 24-7 basis.	spk_293

Neutrality has served us well. There is clearly a drift away from our current neutral status. The Government appears to be pushing us away from it. I know the Tánaiste is nodding his head but that is the strong impression that people have. Internationally, we are held in high regard for our commitment to peace and stability. The high regard our peacekeepers are held in is a clear testimony to this. While I welcome every opportunity to speak about the importance of upholding and strengthening Irish neutrality, I do not feel the consultative forum the Tánaiste has put in place is a fitting process for what is such an important issue for the Irish public. The public clearly supports our neutral position. The consultative forum will minimise the voice of ordinary people who overwhelmingly support neutrality. This forum will be made up of Government appointees. They say that if you want a particular point of view you should hire a planner. The planner will give you that point of view. In some ways that is what this feels like. The Government is getting the consultant to tell it what it wants. It will then be brought back and we will be told this was democracy in action. The reality is that the concluding report will be authored by another Government appointee and the fair and just process would have been to let the voices of ordinary people be heard through a citizens' assembly.Elements within the Government are pushing the narrative that neutrality leaves Ireland weak and exposed. What they fail to highlight is that successive Governments have failed our Defence Forces. Through cut after cut, they have stripped the Defence Forces down to the bare minimum. A neutral state has a responsibility to secure its land, air, and seas but successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments have underinvested in and have run down our Defence Forces. We need to see effective and meaningful investment in our Defence Forces. We need to see the value and respect being shown by the Government to the men and women who carry out the task of securing this State. For decades, Ireland's voice, as a neutral state with a deep commitment for peace, was heard and respected globally. We were clearly known for our determination to build peace between conflicting groups. A previous speaker mentioned Éamon de Valera and the major contribution made and when you look back at the impact made by Frank Aiken during his time as Minister, he was a strong voice against European colonialism in Africa, spoke out against apartheid in South Africa, was deeply committed to peace in the Middle East and, of course, was a champion of nuclear non-proliferation.

There is a determination by some in government who want to end our neutrality. Ireland needs to return to the global stage as a voice for peace. We are living in a time where the European Union is losing sight of its global aims and objectives, namely, building peace and mutual respect among people, respect for human rights and the strict observance of international law. We are not doing that. The military-industry complex in the EU has silently developed into one of the world's largest and profits by EU states have clearly taken precedent over the aims of the EU worldwide. The EU policy on arms trade clearly states ""member states are determined to prevent the export of military technology and equipment which might be used for internal repression or international aggression or contribute to regional instability"", yet Saudi Arabia is one of the largest buyers of EU-made weapons. It has used weapons made in the EU to rain down untold damage, suffering and death on the people of Yemen. Billions of euro in arms have been exported from the EU to apartheid Israel to be used in the oppression of the Palestinian people. Fighter jets used to bomb Gaza and kill civilians were made in northern Italy. Despite countless international human rights groups documenting these war crimes and acts of apartheid, these EU states clearly continue to violate the EU policy on arms trade and face absolutely no consequences. The EU stays silent while EU member states make large profits selling weapons to those rogue states and fuelling global instability. Ireland is part of that. How can the Tánaiste deny that is not happening? That is happening. We are engaging with military sales to countries that are breaking international laws and that is part of Ireland's role."	spk_334

I acknowledge the presence of the Palestinian ambassador in the Gallery today. There is a trend with this Government that is becoming more and more frequent, that is, switching into spectator mode. We have seen the Government standing on the sidelines watching crisis after crisis evolving and we have listened to Government Deputies making statements and comments as if they were just spectators on the sidelines and not actually members of Government. The EU's complicity in Israel's brutal system of apartheid is yet another example of this Government switching into spectator mode, afraid to rock the boat in Brussels. We have seen the Government take strong positions on sanctioning Russia for its crimes but only when other EU states acted first. Thanks to the UN's database of companies operating in the illegal Israeli settlements, it is clear that Irish taxpayers' money is being used to continue human rights violations in these illegal settlements. Successive Irish Governments have taken the position that Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are illegal under international law. However, ISIF considers it right to invest in and work with those who are actively supporting and advancing illegal settlements and, by so doing, facilitates what is clearly a crime under international law. The Government needs to switch off spectator mode and realise it is a willing participant in Israel's brutal crimes. The Irish Government must step up to the fore in the EU and take a stand against Israel's brutal system of apartheid that has been inflicted on the Palestinian people. ISIF must be compelled to divest itself of all current assets in any companies which operate in the illegal Israeli settlements. It must also prohibit any future investment in the illegal Israeli apartheid settlements. We must send out a clear message that Ireland does not stand on the side of apartheid.	spk_265

It was signed when much of Europe was still rubble after the devastation of the Second World War. The aim behind it was simple: to prevent the horrors of war from ever unfolding in Europe again. The declaration fittingly states its aim to make war between the historic rivals ""not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible"". The declaration set in place a vision for a new Europe with co-operation and peace at its core. I heard the Ceann Comhairle’s speech in LH 2000 earlier. He noted how the EU has been transformative for Ireland. Sadly, however, war once again rages in Europe, with levels of destruction not seen since the Second World War being unleashed across Ukraine. Over the decades, the EU has been to the fore in advancing social progress across member states and workers’ rights and environmental regulations have benefited Ireland. In recent years, however, it has clearly been failing in its aims and objectives. The growing EU policies of privatisation, deregulation and increased militarisation represent all that has gone wrong with the European project. These policies merely aim to benefit a minority within Europe. Privatisation and militarisation will not help workers struggling to pay energy bills and put food on the table. These policies will only drive up the cost of living. We need a European Union that strives for better for all, not just those in Europe. We need a European Union that strives for peace and justice globally. Undoubtedly, there has been a drift among EU members towards militarisation. Our own Government is looking to abandon military neutrality at a time when we need less war.

Perhaps the most visible sign of the cost-of-living crisis is the continual rise in the cost of food and groceries. Everyone in a household, from children to parents, can see prices rising. The Government's approach of sitting on its hands as food prices soar shows clearly how utterly out of touch it is with ordinary workers and their families. What will it take for this Government finally to stand on the side of ordinary workers and their families? Workers are seeing their real wages steadily decrease. At the same time, the price of the finished products produced by farmers has also been decreasing since last December yet the price of food and groceries is rising month after month. It has increased 17% since last year. Supermarket chains are making record profits at the expense of ordinary workers and their families. The greed of record profits is running wild and must be reined in. Companies are clearly using inflation as an excuse to rake in high profits. The trade unions recently described it well when they called it ""greedflation"". How far will the Government let the price gouging go before saying enough is enough? Workers need to see real and meaningful change from this Government. We need to see the Government start by instructing the CCPC to investigate possible price gouging in the retail food and grocery sector. We cannot let food prices rise any more.

This is a deeply unfair method and has a disproportionately negative impact on clubs in less affluent communities that simply do not have €40,000 or €50,000 at hand. Clubs in some communities have been unable to draw down grants as a result. Others have to take out loans to draw down grants but not all clubs have the ability to take out loans or even bridging loans. Many other sport clubs can pay up-front. Will the sports capital programme be reformed to end what is effectively discrimination against clubs in less-affluent areas?	spk_228

Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-04-25	dail	33	Re-introduction of Mortgage Interest Relief: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_21	I commend my Sinn Féin colleagues on the motion. We have seen from previous financial crashes, including those associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the current cost-of-living crisis, that we live in a very volatile economic system. It is shifting and changing, not always for the better. Since July, the European Central Bank has increased its key lending rate six times. Many struggle to get their head around the impact of these announcements and how they may impact on their repayments. These interest rate hikes are having a crippling effect on thousands of families. While this Government is sanctioning €1 billion in savings to developers, it will not help struggling mortgage holders. These hikes are costing families thousands over the course of a year. Ireland's mortgage rates are already much higher than the European average. Homeowners whose mortgages were sold off to vulture funds are among those most at risk. Some of their rates have gone as high as 7.5%. Those homeowners have been abandoned by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party and left at the mercy of the vulture funds. As a result of all these hikes in interest rates, homeowners are now under severe financial pressure and deeply worried about what lies ahead. The fear of losing their homes is a tragic possibility for many. At a time when the Government is forecasting a surplus of more than €10 billion this year, why is it not standing on the side of homeowners? We have never been a wealthier country. We have never had so much money and yet so many have so little. People are suffering and having to put up with the Government supporting developers and vulture funds, while it gives no relief to hardworking mortgage holders. Why is the Government not giving homeowners the break so many are calling out for and need? The sharp rise in interest rates is not just having a harsh impact on mortgage holders. The increases in interest rates are pushing the possibility of buying a home further and further away from first-time buyers. They are being left to pay sky-high rents as the Government fails to deliver affordable housing. Sinn Féin has repeatedly called for the introduction of temporary mortgage relief, a proposal that would see homeowners who are struggling with their mortgages get support, with relief of up to €1,500.	spk_291

Too many communities feel anxious, unsafe and abandoned as they face the terror, devastation and heartbreak that crime brings to their neighbourhoods. Criminals do not represent these hard-working, decent communities, such as those in Pearse Street, City Quay, Cuffe Street and so many more which contribute so much to Dublin life and are rightly appalled and horrified by these thugs. These communities deserve to feel safe and protected. They deserve to be able to walk around their neighbourhoods, send their children out to play and sleep soundly at home. Yet, when I talk to residents they tell me they feel trapped, forgotten about and abandoned by this Government. Fine Gael has held responsibility for the Department of Justice for more than a decade and in this time, policing and community safety have hit rock bottom. Gardaí do an incredible job, working hard day in and day out to protect our communities. I commend their bravery and hard work as they serve on the front line day and night in often extremely challenging circumstances. However, they too feel abandoned by the Government. They are overworked, understaffed and struggling to do their jobs safely. They have seen first-hand how Fine Gael's failure to invest in An Garda Síochána has brought the service to its knees. Never have I witnessed morale so low among gardaí. They are resigning in record numbers and the Garda is struggling to recruit the new officers it needs. Gardaí feel unsafe at work. It is as simple as that. Morale is on the floor. They are denied the modern equipment they need to do their jobs. It is no wonder it is proving so hard to increase Garda numbers. The self-professed party of law and order, Fine Gael, has stripped An Garda Síochána through its failure to provide leadership. Fine Gael is soft on crime and decent, hard-working communities are forced to pay the price. The Government must get to grips with organised crime. I see it in my constituency in Pearse Street. I heard previous Government speakers say there were loads of resources. The resources are not available. The local youth club that does fantastic work in Pearse Street has no own-door facility. It has to rent facilities it can use.	spk_478

The Minister mentioned voids and said he was focused on voids. I could bring him to any number of flats around here and show him that the number of voids is extensive. There are two voids in Leo Fitzgerald House and they have been empty for more than a year. There needs to be more focus on voids. Why would the Government not use that €1 billion to get a share in the Irish Glass Bottle site to increase the number of affordable and public homes on that site? The Irish Glass Bottle site will have 950 homes on it with the mix between social and affordable. It is hard to see how the affordable homes on the Irish Glass Bottle site will be affordable. Even with the current Government subvention guidelines, affordable homes will not be even close to affordable. The well-informed speculation is that homes in the Irish Glass Bottle site will cost approximately €650,000 to €700,000 at cost price, which is far from affordable. Even with the subvention it will not make them affordable. Building enabling works are advanced and yet there is still no affordable scheme. When will we get an affordable scheme on the Irish Glass Bottle site? Every day I get emails and messages asking when an affordable scheme will be in place. What is the delay? The Minister should explain to residents who are living in overcrowded conditions what the delay is. The delay is only adding to the prices residents in Ringsend and Sandymount will need to pay. The affordable schemes need to be tied down as a matter of urgency. It is also very important that the Government and Dublin City Council are committed to ensuring that the social housing is on the site and not moved away from the local community. The area around Ringsend, Irishtown and Pearse Street has lost many homes because developers were allowed to buy their way out of the Part V clause in providing homes in those communities because of the cost of the land. This cannot be allowed to happen on the Irish Glass Bottle site and Government needs to give a commitment that it will not happen.	spk_347

It is important as 58 schools have been impacted by the freezing of the process to develop and build schools. Four of the schools are in my constituency. Harold's Cross Educate Together National School, ETNS, Harold's Cross Educate Together Secondary School, ETSS, and Shellybanks ETNS and Sandymount Park ETSS, which are both in Sandymount. I met the staff of the Harold's Cross schools last week. The principals Ruth and in the secondary school, Pádraig Conaty, do fantastic work. I spoke with the third-year students who outlined the challenges they face because there is no indoor lunch area and no recreational area. They are surrounded by a building site. It is very loud and there is a lot of dust and dirt. It is certainly not conducive to a developing school. The students must eat at their desks when the weather is bad, and the Irish weather during winter is not great. They spend a lot of their break times in their classrooms. We all know how important PE is to students and yet there is no indoor exercise area at all. The students knew being on site as the school was developed would not be ideal but they liked the ethos of the school and they were very fond of the teachers and were appreciative of the work the teachers and principal did, so they signed up to the Harold's Cross schools. Parents and students assumed the building would continue but, out of the blue, everything was frozen. They are upset about the uncertainty and that the current conditions in which they are being educated will continue. It should be also pointed out that delays in school building and school development causes delays for the neurodiverse in the community who are already treated like second-class citizens. They are bussed and taxied out of their communities to school. These delays are adding to the stress caused to children and parents, as highlighted to me by Involve Autism and Neurodiversity – Irishtown, Ringsend and Pearse Street, NIRP. This freezing of the development of schools is a huge worry. The Department must address this as a matter of urgency and unfreeze the funds.	spk_638

The Government's legacy will be one of failure in housing, with Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and Fine Gael repeatedly failing to stand on the side of those most in need. The Government failed to provide for the most basic of needs – a safe home for them and their families – for ordinary people, including more vulnerable members of society. The figures released recently by the RTB show that many of those issued with notices to quit are families with children, couples and pensioners. Some of these will find themselves in need of emergency accommodation, of which there is none even for those who are already out on the street and sleeping rough. People will have to couch surf and relationships will break down. That is inevitable. Others will be forced to emigrate or will find themselves sleeping in cars. As the private rental market continues to fail to provide sufficient and affordable housing, the Government decision to end the eviction ban will see more people enter into homelessness and hardship. I was contacted by a tenant today who had received an eviction notice. She said that she was scared for her children. The Government has lost control of the homeless crisis and levels of homelessness continue to rise. By ending the winter ban on evictions, this number will grow larger in the coming months. The damage being inflicted on ordinary people by the Government is heartless and will be felt for generations to come. I can see its impact across my constituency. Young couples want to settle down in communities like Ringsend and start families, but they cannot do so. They find it impossible to locate affordable housing. The housing at the Irish Glass Bottle site is not going to be affordable. What is happening is having a devastating impact on communities across the city and country. I support the motion.	spk_241

It is very important legislation because it is clearly very important to have minimum standards in private rented accommodation. In my constituency, there is a huge amount of private rented accommodation in Rathmines, Harold's Cross and Sandymount. I believe the vast majority of landlords will welcome this Bill. It will help them and their tenants. The idea of an NCT for private rental accommodation is a very important proposal. While the Government is not opposing the Bill, the concern is that it will be allowed to wither and die, which is what happens generally to Opposition proposals. I highlight, as I have done many times previously, the fact that there are no minimum standards for flat complexes and public housing across Dublin city. Perhaps there are in theory but in practice, there are none. I was in York Street yesterday. A resident called me up and asked me to have a look at something. He pointed out that the bedroom window, the sitting room window and the bathroom windows in his apartment have no handles. They are locked tight. Two years ago, Dublin City Council told this tenant the handles were broken and would be taken away and put back on later. That was two years ago and he has not yet seen them. The windows have been locked tight since then. That is the sort of neglect residents in Dublin City Council properties face day in and day out. Another tenant in York Street showed me a balcony door where if you open it out on to the balcony and the door swings closed, you cannot open it because there is no handle on the outside. It is madness that tenants of Dublin City Council properties have to live in those sorts of conditions. The flats in Pearse House, Mercer House, Whelan House and O'Rahilly House in Ringsend were built to take people from the tenements. As one person said to me recently, they are now living in modern-day tenements. There needs to be urgency but there is no urgency in Government.  I was at a meeting with tenants in St. Andrew's Resource Centre about four or five years ago at which Dublin City Council stated it was going to knock down the small block of flats in St. Andrew's Court. A design team has been appointed but people are still waiting four or five years later. A private developer built 21 apartments down the road within two years. There is no sense of urgency. Dublin City Council and the Government show neglect again and again. The Government cannot wash its hands and place the blame on local authorities. It must accept that it has neglected tenants living in the flat complexes for years. Another time, a resident rang me in desperation because the sewage pipes were flooding into the public domain in Canon Mooney Garden flats. Raw sewage and toilet paper were floating around. This is where children's toys such as skipping ropes are stored. This is happening every three or four months and I get a call when it does. The council told residents at one point that it would take ten days to get a choke car out. This is not acceptable. People cannot be allowed to live in conditions like that. We are talking about minimum standards. Dublin City Council and the Government have accepted that there are no minimum standards for flat complexes. It is horrendous. I honestly do not know how there has not been a revolution from those living in the flat complexes. How they have not protested much more aggressively, to put it kindly, is beyond me.  I met a resident in a two-bedroom flat with two sons and a daughter. There is a 25-year-old, a 22-year-old and a 13-year-old girl - two boys and a girl - living in one bedroom. How can that be acceptable? How can the Government stand over that? I know the Minister of State does not stand over it but there must be some sort of urgency here for people living in flat complexes in Rathmines and Donnybrook and all the flat complexes across the city. I am naming the ones in my constituency because they are the people I know and I can see the conditions they have to live in. Raw sewage coming up in public areas because of the neglect by Dublin City Council and the Government is just not acceptable. It is unfair. The Government must have some minimum standards for flat complexes so residents can report when the heating is broken. The water tank in York Street burst and all the tenants underneath had to be moved out. In fairness, it has been fixed. Normally there are three estate managers in Dublin City Council in the Dublin Bay South constituency dealing with flat complexes. Today, due to illness and promotions, there are no estate managers so tenants come to us as public representatives. We should not have to do this. As a result of the neglect and lack of urgency shown by Government towards those living in flat complexes, we end up having to raise these issues on the floor of the Dáil, which we should not have to do. It is frustrating for me as a public representative so I can imagine how horrific and depressing it is for residents and how having to put up with these unacceptable standards affects families' mental health. We need to see fast-tracking and a sense of urgency regarding regeneration programmes for those living in flat complexes. I will continue saying this until there is some sense of urgency about addressing the neglect of those living in the flat complexes by Government and Dublin City Council.	spk_498

On 17 March, the International Criminal Court, ICC, took the brave step of finally issuing an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin, and I commend the speed at which the ICC operated on this case. It took less than four weeks for these arrest warrants to be issued by the court. At its heart, the Rome Statute of the ICC clearly states the international crimes the court has jurisdiction to investigate, including crimes such as deportation or the forcible transfer of population, torture, persecution, apartheid, murder, cruel treatment and sentencing or execution without due process. As I read this list, the apartheid State of Israel comes to mind in respect of each and every one of those crimes. Over the weekend, the death toll of Palestinians rose again. One Palestinian was executed with a single shot to the head at point-blank range as he lay face down on the ground. In the middle of the day, in the middle of a busy street, he was murdered by undercover Israeli agents. When will arrest warrants issue for those who are responsible for these brutal crimes being inflicted on the people of Palestine? Over the weekend, the Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, stated, “There is no such thing as a Palestinian people."" This Israeli Government has done away with all pretence that it wants to engage in diplomacy. It is now the case that Ireland believes we should hold the Russians to account but allow apartheid Israel to kill away and build illegal settlements. When will enough be enough?

All children who need an individual educational plan should get an individual educational plan. The EPSEN Act was enacted in 2004 to provide education in an inclusive mainstream setting. That is unfortunately not happening. There is a situation where neurodiverse children are bussed out of their community at a huge expense to the Exchequer. Taxis and buses cost a phenomenal amount. I could be wrong but I am pretty sure it costs about €70,000 a day for southside neurodiverse children to be bussed out of their community to schools further out. The 55 or 58 school building projects which have been held up were mentioned. My constituency has Harold's Cross Educate Together National School, Harold's Cross Educate Together Secondary School, Shellybanks Educate Together National School and Sandymount Park Educate Together Secondary School. They have all been delayed. That will have a significant impact on children. I was contacted by Involve Autism, which I know the Minister of State has worked closely with, and Neurodiversity - Irishtown, Ringsend and Pearse Street. They are distraught that this will have a huge impact on them. Places for neurodiverse children are already short. One just has to talk to Involve Autism, which will say that there are almost no school places for neurodiverse children and children with autism in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W. That has to be addressed. The hold-up of the schools building programme will have a significant impact. Like I said, parents have already contacted me to express concern. We need to ensure these families can get some solace. I know it is not all in the Minister of State's Department. The Department of Finance also has an impact. Children who are the most vulnerable in our society and who have been neglected and abandoned for many years now face more uncertainty and have no clarity about whether they will have school places in the coming months and years. These schools, including Harold's Cross, Shellybanks and Sandymount Park, have huge waiting lists not just for neurotypical children but for neurodiverse children. We have to address that. The Government is adding further concern to the already significant concern that parents of children with autism have. We can have all the plans and reviews but if we do not have the schools, it is academic. I ask that the green light be given to the schools I mentioned.	spk_507

For many people, particularly those at risk of poverty who budget with cash, moving to a cashless society is a huge concern. It shows a disconnect between Government and many big businesses, such as Ryanair, and ordinary people, particularly older people and people at risk of poverty. The GAA is the biggest grassroots organisation in Ireland and is a central pillar in community life. For many, the love of sport starts at an early age and follows though their whole life. It is disappointing to see the GAA introduce a cashless policy for tickets at grounds which will, without doubt, have a disproportionate impact on some of the most marginalised and vulnerable groups in our communities. The GAA, and going to matches, is such an important part of the social infrastructure for so many people, young and old. Research from Age Action Ireland shows that two thirds of the over 65 age group relies on cash. Last year, we saw AIB reverse its decision to remove cash service on the premise that the move would adversely impact several groups, such as the older generation. I have written to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and Sport Ireland asking that they listen to the concerns of groups, such as Age Action, Age NI and GAA for All. I ask that the Minister and Sport Ireland engage with the GAA to find a solution for the more marginalised and vulnerable groups in our community. As Deputy Gould mentioned, the GAA is so important to us all and has been the bedrock of so many communities across the country. Fairness underpins the GAA, but this is unfair and it needs to be changed.	spk_33

I heard the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, say last night that Sinn Féin believed front-line staff were failing. We do not believe front-line staff are failing; we believe the Government has failed. The Government has failed paramedics and front-line health workers and it has failed in housing and in protecting inner city communities. The list is endless. The Government has failed to support front-line paramedics to keep up with the demand for emergency services. The failure to provide this much-needed support puts lives at risk. As per the HSE's own standards, 80% of life-threatening incidents should be responded to by ambulance within 19 minutes. Dublin Fire Brigade responded to only 19% of delta incidents within 19 minutes. These front-line workers, the heroes to those in need of urgent care, are struggling. They are struggling to keep up with the demand for emergency services and they face immense pressure. The Government urgently needs to publish a multi-annual capacity and workforce plan to meet the demands of patients. This will also improve the ability of the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade to save lives. A serious plan is needed with targets and timelines if the ambulance service is to reverse the trend and improve outcomes. The increase in response times is bleak. It shows clearly that the ambulance services are under serious strain and pressure. This is exactly what paramedics have been warning about for years. Ambulance service staff have offered solutions that would make a difference but they are not being listened to. There are not enough crews or ambulances. We need a serious and comprehensive recruitment campaign to address the shortfalls in the ambulance service.	spk_32
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-02-23	dail	33	Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill 2023: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_34	The need for reform has been acknowledged for years. This was further highlighted in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland published in 2021. The Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill 2023 is a move in that direction. This Bill was dealt with extensively in the pre-legislative scrutiny stage with many proposed reforms criticised by many stakeholders in the committee. That being said, there are many positive steps in this Bill that will bring about long-overdue reform and create effective oversight and accountability for An Garda Síochána, which both gardaí and the public will welcome. This Bill sets out to abolish local policing partnerships and introduce local community safety partnerships. These new local community safety partnerships will have more defined powers, including setting priorities locally. While this is a welcome improvement, important detail of how this will look in practice is lacking. Like everything else, the devil is in the detail and so we need to see the detail. We need to see an acceleration in the freeing up of An Garda Síochána members for administrative and office work in order that we can have more members out in the streets and engaging with the local community. I have raised in this Chamber on many occasions the concerns of inner-city residents around street violence and other street crime, with City Quay and the Cabbage Patch being prime examples of what strong community engagement from An Garda Síochána and Dublin City Council committee can achieve. These are two positive examples in the south inner city. Much work needs to be done and increased resources are needed. To keep up this work, however, local gardaí will need to be given proper resources. When it comes to policing our communities, we cannot allow the scenes that were witnessed at Ballyfermot to be repeated. To see gardaí surrounded and assaulted by gangs on scrambler motorcycles was chilling and stark. It is important to acknowledge the commitment and work of the gardaí who were there on site. Their professionalism is to be lauded. To be able to carry out their duties with the pressure they were under is a credit to them and the force. This animal-like behaviour by the individuals on scramblers was completely unacceptable. These individuals feel untouchable due to the Garda policy of do not engage and do not pursue. Front-line gardaí run the very real risk of being prosecuted for dangerous driving should they feel the need to pursue and engage these criminals. The policy of do not engage and do not pursue in my view and from speaking to gardaí is having a demoralising impact on rank-and-file gardaí. It is not hard to understand that when there is an incident like what happened in Ballyfermot or the many other incidents. If a garda tries to intercept a particular person on a scrambler, they will be in more trouble than the person on the scrambler. It is hugely frustrating for gardaí. Like I said, it is not hard to see why it is getting increasingly difficult to get recruits for the Garda when they feel that they are being held to account whereas the people on the scramblers are not. The policy of do not engage and do not pursue has to be changed. It was changed in London and it is much more effective than to let these thugs on scramblers do what they want.	spk_293
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-02-23	dail	33	Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_42	"I acknowledge the presence of the INOU and the ATD campaign. It is important to acknowledge the tireless campaign they have put into this Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to amend Irish equality legislation and the two equality Acts: the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act. As has been said, they cover the nine grounds of marital status, family status, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, religion and membership of the Traveller community.In addition, the Acts prohibit discrimination in the provision of accommodation services against people who are in receipt of the rent supplement, housing assistance or social welfare payments. The purpose of the Bill is to expand the protections of both Acts to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disadvantaged socioeconomic status. This would make an amendment to include a new ground on disadvantaged socioeconomic status. As the ATD campaign indicated in its infographic, it is the tenth, and very important, piece of the jigsaw. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure persons can no longer be discriminated against on the basis they are coming from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background. This proposal is in no way new. We are not reinventing the wheel. The Government has been reviewing the matter for years and it has been argued for since the Employment Equality Act 1998 was being introduced. At that time, in response to the demand for more than nine grounds, the then Minister included a review clause requiring a reassessment of the issue within two years. By 2000, therefore, the addition of a further ground should have been made. The pressure was already there because it was acknowledged it was not sufficiently comprehensive legislation and that there was a need to go further. As part of that review, in 2002, the former Equality Authority proposed the introduction of a socioeconomic status ground highlighting high levels of socioeconomic discrimination in the labour market. In response to the proposal from the former Equality Authority, a research report commissioned by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2004 suggested a socioeconomic status ground would serve the objectives of underpinning equality legislation. This is vital legislation. The Government knows that and referred to it in watery terms in the programme for Government. Importantly, the report also pointed out it would allow a more sophisticated, intersectional approach to its implementation. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, in a 2015 submission to the UN, highlighted the need to prohibit discrimination on the basis of socioeconomic status in equality legislation. The UN committee noted its regret that Irish legislation does not provide protection against discrimination on all grounds of discrimination prohibited by the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. My understanding is that there is, yet again, to be a review of the Equality Acts and the Employment Equality Act which will examine the introduction of socioeconomic grounds for discrimination. To date, however, we still have no guarantee or indication that this review will not fade away like all the others since 1998, some of which I mentioned. The danger is this review or any other review will just continue kicking the can down the road in respect of genuine equality legislation. Reports and reviews must become action. Times are hard for many and the cost-of-living crisis threatens to increase inequality and push people further into the margins. People have enough to deal with without facing discrimination because of who they are or where they are from. On that note, the purpose of the Bill is to ensure people can no longer be discriminated against on the basis they are from a disadvantaged socioeconomic area, because of their background or because of their accent. For example, if the Bill is enacted, employers will not be able to discriminate against a job applicant or current employee because of his or her accent or the socioeconomic status of the area where he or she comes from. Furthermore, it will not be permissible for service providers to discriminate against people because of where they live. The introduction of a socioeconomic status ground will give people who experience discrimination on this ground the practical means to challenge their experience with a rights-based approach, as is the case with the other nine protected grounds. It will also be of symbolic importance for the State to make clear to society and to the people who face this discrimination that it will not be tolerated. By continuing to exclude socioeconomic status in equality legislation, we are creating a hierarchy of equality in which we prohibit and recognise certain forms of discrimination, whereas we do not prohibit and recognise forms of discrimination pertaining to socioeconomic background and accent. Over the past 20 years, there have been countless reports and many recommendations from civil society groups such as IHREC, the UN and, most important, above all those reports and organisations, the people with lived experience such as those I represent in the south inner-city Dublin community and local authority flat complexes that this gap in our legislation needs to be addressed. They tell me they regularly and consistently feel disadvantaged because they are disadvantaged, given the Government is not putting in place legislation to protect inner-city communities. On the topic of lived experience, in parts of the Dublin Bay South constituency I serve, this is a systemic issue that dates back generations for people who live in local authority flat complexes and who report high levels of generational and present-day social exclusion and discrimination that is directly and indirectly due to their socioeconomic background. In one example, a constituent from a flat complex not far from Leinster House, who has a master's degree and is a fluent Portuguese speaker, reported to me that after submitting a video application for a job in a multinational drinks company, he was contacted by a concerned employee of that large multinational company who informed the man that fellow employees had exchanged text messages joking about and mocking the young individual's inner-city Dublin accent, with one questioning how and where a ""knacker"" like him had picked up Portuguese while they were reviewing his video application. That is an horrendous term for anybody to have to hear about themselves or to be attributed to anyone. It is completely unacceptable and it reinforces the need for the legislation to be passed. I am also aware of a case where a lone parent was denied access to a local gym due to concerns that granting her and her children access to the gym and swimming pool could encourage other people from the local community who live in the flats to join the gym as well. On these grounds, she was turned away and advised she would be better off using one of the gyms and swimming pools provided by Dublin City Council. I was struck by another example reported to me in recent years where students entering university through an access programme for disadvantaged students were required to complete a Garda vetting form to ensure they did not have a criminal record, whereas students entering the university through the general stream were not required to do so. It is clear there are unbelievable levels of discrimination against people living in the inner city of Dublin and in other communities throughout the country. They need protection and the Government needs to protect them. It has to stop kicking the can down the road and act, and this is the opportunity to do that."	spk_319
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-02-23	dail	33	Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_42	I appreciate the Minister coming in and listening to the various issues. I know he is committed to equality; it is a common theme throughout his work in Leinster House. I cannot help thinking he is a bit optimistic to suggest that the Government will still be here in 18 months but that is another debate. I acknowledge the work the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers and its officials put in in drafting the Bill. It was detailed and aware of the current political status and debate around equality law. As Deputy Wynne said, we will not be agreeing to the amendment for a number of reasons. The main reason is that the delay sends out a message to residents living in flat complexes in the inner city surrounding this building that they are not a priority. The Minister said that the equality legislation has been here 20 years and we are still waiting to add the tenth ground. It is unacceptable that we can allow this to drift. We could probably fill this room with reports and reviews from all the time spent on it, yet here we are with the Minister telling us we will have to wait another 18 months. It may not happen in the lifetime of this Government. That is the political reality and that may be the case. The Government is not taking the discrimination of people living in working-class communities seriously. The consultation is just an excuse.Socioeconomic status is the tenth piece in the jigsaw. It needs to be introduced as a ground for discrimination as a matter of urgency, as not doing so will create a hierarchy of discrimination. If someone is discriminated against on the basis of race or disability, it is unacceptable, but if he or she is discriminated against on the basis of his or her accent or socioeconomic background, is that supposed to be okay? Judging by the Minister of State's nod, he agrees with me. If we are trying to have perfect legislation that includes everything, we could be going for years and still never have legislation that addresses this matter. This ground for discrimination needs to be introduced urgently. The amendment calls for 18 months. If the Government accepted the Bill, though, the process would take months anyway. The Bill would crawl along before reaching Committee Stage. As such, there is no reason the Government cannot accept it and work with the Deputies involved. Broadly speaking, the vast majority of Members would support this legislation. In that light, it is increasingly frustrating for people living in inner city communities and flat complexes who feel that they are being discriminated against and that the Government does not care about their lives and the reality they face. We must address this issue. The programme for Government is vague and non-committal on this front. The Government is kicking the can down the road for another 18 months. In the meantime, people will be discriminated against. I do not see why the Government cannot support the Bill. As it works through the process, the Government can add other elements to it. I am disappointed, as the amendment is just an exercise in can kicking.	spk_326
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-02-16	dail	33	National Asset Management Agency	dbsect_36	The glass bottle site has been at the heart of the Ringsend and Irishtown community for generations, and families from the community worked there for generations. Seven years ago, there was an agreement to develop 350 public homes and 550 affordable homes there. Residents in Ringsend are increasingly frustrated that there are still no homes on that site and it does not look like there will be any homes on it for a number of years to come. The flats in Ringsend are already overcrowded. In some instances, there are three generations of families living in small two-bedroom flats. Families who have neurodiverse children are already struggling in overcrowded housing. The flats, in many cases, have chronic dampness and mould, and overcrowding is only adding to this. From day one the Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group has done fantastic work in campaigning to get housing on this site. Along with my colleague, Councillor Daniel Céitinn, I met the housing group last week and it is furious with the delays that have occurred. The prices being talked about are ranging between €600,000 and €700,000, depending on the size of the unit being built. That is far from affordable. The longer it takes to start building these homes, the higher the costs will be because of building inflation. We need to see movement, therefore; it is the least the residents in Ringsend and Irishtown deserve. We need to see an agreement on the price and we also need to know how the Government will make these homes affordable because €500,000, €600,000 or €700,000 is not affordable to ordinary working families. How will the Government bring the price down? As my colleague Deputy Ó Broin has said, NAMA will be wound down in 2025. We would ask the Government, along with the Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group and residents in Ringsend and Irishtown, to ensure that the 20% stake NAMA has in the glass bottle site is given to Dublin City Council. The council can then use that to nudge the affordability of these homes towards something that is realistic for ordinary families.	spk_414

Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-02-14	dail	33	Cost-of-Living Supports: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_11	I commend my party colleague Deputy Doherty on bringing forward the motion. The pressure being felt in every community in the State needs to be addressed in a meaningful way whereby ordinary workers and the most vulnerable members of our society will feel the benefit. We see little to no change from energy providers or on the shelves of supermarkets. What we do see are record-high energy bills and record-high profits for the energy sector, with food and energy companies having more than doubled their profits in 2022. Many residents feel utterly crippled in the face of these bills. The residents of Shelbourne Plaza have been hit with colossal bills in recent months because they were locked into astronomical energy rates by the building’s management company. The Government needs to intervene and ensure ordinary people will not be crucified by high energy prices above the already-high charges such as those in Shelbourne Plaza. We often use figures to reflect the cost of living, but behind every figure is a real person who is being crippled by the energy crisis. Nurses are leaving the country because of high costs and that is having a significant impact on our health service. Earlier I met Amanda Boland and Janice Kiernan. Their dad, Joe Griffin, a 74-year-old man, died in St. James's Hospital on 4 January. They are convinced, and showed me compelling evidence, that their dad would still be alive if staffing levels were the way they should be. The staffing in our hospitals is strained because of the high cost of living, which means nurses are moving abroad. This is the impact that the soaring cost of living is having on ordinary people. It is the human impact of soaring costs. For those reasons, we need the measures outlined in the motion, such as a discretionary fund to provide financial support to households experiencing severe utility debt. We also need to expand the fuel allowance to those in receipt of the working family payment.	spk_238
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-02-09	dail	33	Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) Bill 2022: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_34	I welcome the Bill. We have seen wide levels of engagement on this matter from stakeholders on the front line from rank and file gardaí, right up to the Garda Commissioner. I understand that all of them have welcomed the support for the use of body cameras. Deputy Costello referred to public consultation. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Harris, will clarify whether that will be an integral part of this legislation. It is very important that people are aware of what the legislation is, how it will work, and have an understanding of it. It is important to bring people along with us and not just announce the legislation. I certainly will be interested to hear about that. It is really important that there is a public consultation element to it. For years the modernising of An Garda Síochána has moved at far too slow a pace. Ireland has lagged behind other EU member states for many years on this front. Those who stand on the front line serving the public in times of need must be given the tools and resources to ensure a high standard of public safety. It is important that these are provided in order that both members of the Garda and the public are protected, so it is a win-win. I will take this chance to acknowledge the really good work that members of the Garda do in Pearse Street and Kevin Street Garda stations. Gardaí working on the front line do a really good and professional job. The job they do is very important. The violent running battles in the City Quay area are well documented. The gardaí from Pearse Street Garda station have done a fantastic job in working with City Quay residents and Creighton Street residents. Their work is far from easy but they do it so professionally and their commitment is second to none. Superintendent Dermot McKenna of Pearse Street Garda station has been involved from the start in ensuring resources are in place to protect residents. I believe the Garda needs more resources in the inner city. I have said it before and I will continue to say it. This is essential. The Government needs to respond. The Cabbage Patch in Kevin Street is a small park in Dublin 8 that has been neglected for years. It would not be safe unless members of the Garda were involved in saving this park. A lot more work needs to be done but it is heading in the right direction. I welcome this legislation. The body camera is key. As mentioned previously, we are in a surveillance society. It appears to be in everything, from doorbells, to the Luas, to people using phones. I saw an incident recently where someone was being assaulted. Rather than call the Garda, people filmed it. It seems that this is the type of society we have gone to. The use of body cameras is not a groundbreaking or radical idea. It has been on the go for many years across the US, England, Scotland and Wales, along with many EU member states. The benefits are well documented. Body cameras have been shown to work in a twofold manner: footage can provide for protection for members of An Garda Síochána from bogus complaints, and they can also provide the public with a safeguard against Garda wrongdoing. We are witnessing record numbers of members of An Garda Síochána leaving the job in the past few years. From what I can ascertain from meeting gardaí on the front line, morale appears low and people are very downbeat about working in An Garda Síochána in the future. On many occasions they are despondent and this is reflected in the numbers of people leaving. It is vital that we provide new and existing members of An Garda Síochána with the best tools and resources to go about their duties. I suppose, however, it is wider than just that, as the Minister will be aware. We need to ensure the protection of people and provide the technology to Garda members to do their job properly. While body cameras are a step in the right direction, they must go hand in hand with increasing the resources across the board and by increasing the numbers of gardaí available to communities right across the State.	spk_306
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-02-09	dail	33	Emergency Housing Measures: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_36	I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this motion. It is important for those living in the flats across inner city Dublin, for the people living in Nicholas Street, Ross Road and Bride Street. So many people have lost so much because of the overcrowded conditions in their homes. Flats are overcrowded and neglected by the Government. Two and three generations are living under one small roof. Dampness and mould are impacting many people. The Government is overwhelmed by the issues facing residents living in the likes of Leo Fitzgerald House and Digges Street. If it was not overwhelmed, the Government would do something about it, but it is not doing anything. There are no signs that it is committed to changing the lives and conditions of people living in flat complexes. There is very little evidence to suggest that is the case. The Government is happy to increase the number of people living in inner city communities, but it has no interest in increasing the facilities and services available to those same local communities. Neglect of inner city communities will be the legacy of this Government. Neglect of those living in flat complexes will be the legacy of this Government. Investment in inner city communities and in the flat complexes is needed. We need direct intervention by the Government to co-ordinate and ring-fence funding for the redevelopment of the flat complexes. We also need to focus on the delivery of social and affordable homes, as has been mentioned. Not enough is being done to accelerate the delivery of social and affordable housing. Residents are concerned about the slow rate of development of the Ringsend and Irishtown Glass Bottle site. I met the Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group last night. It is concerned that the affordable homes will not be affordable. Prices of apartments on the Glass Bottle site that have been mentioned are in the region of €650,000. That is hardly affordable. With the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, due to be dissolved in 2025, residents request that the 20% stake NAMA has in the Glass Bottle Site be transferred to Dublin City Council and ring-fenced for affordable homes on the Glass Bottle site in order to nudge the cost towards affordability. Will the Minister of State commit to this happening? It is doable and it must be done. I also reiterate the many calls for the extension of the eviction ban. Today my office received four calls from tenants who are facing eviction at the start of April. People talk about a cliff. It is scary for people. People are at their wits' end and it will be unacceptable if the Government does not extend the eviction ban.	spk_319

While there is a diverse community in Dublin 2 and 8, the Government continues to increase the number of people in the inner city without increasing facilities and services.  The Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, campus on Aungier Street represents a huge opportunity to reverse the neglect by the Government.  It offers an opportunity for the State to make some small amends for decades of neglect.  The DIT building is a huge site and a huge asset for the State.  It offers a real opportunity to deliver some essential services and facilities for residents living in the Dublin 2 and 8 area.  The nearby DIT building on Kevin Street was sold off to a private developer some years ago.  It will add nothing to the local community in terms of the facilities and services that are needed for a functioning community.  This development will just add more pressure to services and facilities.  The DIT site in Aungier Street cannot just be sold off and more residents added to the community, which is already bursting at the seems.  The Government needs to ensure that additional services and facilities are put in place.  The neglect of the flats needs to stop.  One positive measure that would help that would be that the community would have a publicly accessible leisure and sports centre on the site of the DIT in Aungier Street.  That would be a great and necessary asset for a community that is at capacity, for everyone, especially a community that has been neglected for years.	spk_346
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-02-09	dail	33	Institutes of Technology	dbsect_37	I thank the Minister of State for her response. The DIT campus on Aungier Street is a huge facility and is going to be redeveloped. Ultimately, it will probably be a build-to-rent building like the one at the DIT site on Kevin Street. That building will be 14 storeys high and will have a huge impact on the area. The construction is already having a huge impact on local residents on Kevin Street and Bishop Street. It is not going to add anything to the area. It is going to bring in a huge number of people. As I said, the area lacks sports facilities for local sports and football clubs. I know the Minister of State is associated with Granada Football Club, which is a fantastic club with great facilities and that is great to see. I know the club could always do with more facilities but the reality is that for those around Kevin Street there is a tiny pitch - it is hardly the size of the floor space in this room - on Digges Street. Kids training and playing for any of the local clubs, including the Iveagh Trust or the Iveagh Celtic club and Aungier Street have to travel to Crumlin to play on a full sized astro turf pitch or even to train on a decent sized astro turf or grass pitch. They have to travel quite a significant distance and it is very hard to get young children to travel such distances just to train on a Tuesday and Thursday evening. The Iveagh Celtic club and the Aungier Street club do fantastic work in the local community but they do not have the facilities. I met a group of older people yesterday who were saying that there are no facilities in the area. We do not even have a swimming pool. Lots of areas have pools and sports facilities which are so important for a functioning, healthy community but they are all lacking in the area. There is no reason sports facilities cannot be made available on the Aungier Street campus. I am not suggesting that we take over the entire DIT campus but that we develop a sports and leisure centre on the site. That is very doable and realistic but there must be a commitment and an acknowledgement that communities in the inner city have been neglected for years. We must make amends for that and that is what this Government needs to do.	spk_348

I know the club could always do with more facilities but the reality is that for those around Kevin Street there is a tiny pitch - it is hardly the size of the floor space in this room - on Digges Street. Kids training and playing for any of the local clubs, including the Iveagh Trust or the Iveagh Celtic club and Aungier Street have to travel to Crumlin to play on a full sized astro turf pitch or even to train on a decent sized astro turf or grass pitch. They have to travel quite a significant distance and it is very hard to get young children to travel such distances just to train on a Tuesday and Thursday evening. The Iveagh Celtic club and the Aungier Street club do fantastic work in the local community but they do not have the facilities. I met a group of older people yesterday who were saying that there are no facilities in the area. We do not even have a swimming pool. Lots of areas have pools and sports facilities which are so important for a functioning, healthy community but they are all lacking in the area. There is no reason sports facilities cannot be made available on the Aungier Street campus. I am not suggesting that we take over the entire DIT campus but that we develop a sports and leisure centre on the site. That is very doable and realistic but there must be a commitment and an acknowledgement that communities in the inner city have been neglected for years. We must make amends for that and that is what this Government needs to do.	spk_348

Certainly if Croke Park is not possible, a bigger venue than the 3Arena would be ideal. Some 80,000 fans in Croke Park cheering on Katie Taylor would be a fitting acknowledgement of the contribution she has made to Irish sport and to women in sport.

Can the Minister of State confirm that this change is going to happen and that services will be moved from Ringsend and Irishtown primary care centre to the Meath Hospital site? These services are important. Residents received letters stating that the physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions were going to be moved out of Irishtown. This is a well populated area, especially with older people, and this move will have a major impact on people. Regarding these older people, Deputy Moynihan, on the previous matter, mentioned keeping people in their homes. This move is going to fast-track people into hospital and lead to a deterioration in people's health. People are receiving these services because they already have mobility issues. There is no transport link from Ringsend and Irishtown to the Meath Hospital just off the South Circular Road. At the last general election and even at the last by-election, the Government candidate spoke about a 15-minute city. This is going to make a 15-minute city impossible because it will take two bus journeys for people to reach the Meath Hospital. When they arrive there and get off the second bus journey, they will then have to take a long walk up to the hospital. This issue is about the restricting of access. This move is restricting access for older people in Ringsend and Irishtown to community services. People are genuinely dismayed that they will have to move from a perfectly good primary healthcare centre up to the Meath Hospital.

These are also signed off with a subheading referring to ""care, compassion, trust and learning"". None of those elements appear to apply to this decision.

It will be an interesting journey for him, I am sure. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. When looking at inner-city communities in Dublin, the neglect is obvious. Communities have been neglected.Flat complexes have been neglected. I was in Macken Villas, which is a flat complex not too far from here. The neglect there is obvious. Conway Court is the same. The neglect there is so obvious. It is hard to sum up the frustration felt by residents. They pay their rent, work hard and kept the front line going during the pandemic, yet they have been neglected for decades. If you look at Mercer House or Markiewicz House, you can see big glistening towers going up all around them yet rats are running around play areas. The tenants put in a simple request for gates - not a chance. Residents of Macken Villas are looking for the upgrading and even cleaning of the playground but no funding is being provided. Bartra has big developments right beside the flats, yet tenants see no benefit to them. People living in flats in Cuffe Street and Digges Street do not even have a small playground for toddlers. All they are looking for is a certain amount of funding, not all of it, to be ring-fenced to benefit the local community because they are the residents who are going to have put up with the noise, dirt and lack of light. It is a significant issue for them. They have been neglected for years. I do not blame residents for feeling frustrated. A lot of protests are taking place. People are so frustrated because they have been neglected for years. It is inevitable. If I was living in Glovers Court, I would probably not pay my rent because the conditions people have to live in are unacceptable. The residents of Markiewicz House are looking for gates to provide an added sense of security, yet that is not tolerated, funded or supported. There needs to be a real commitment by local government and the Government to ensuring a certain amount of ring-fencing so that local communities will benefit from these huge towers and developments being built right on their doorstep. The old Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, site on Aungier Street will be sold for millions. It will be developed to the nth degree, yet local communities will not benefit in any way from that. I know residents have put forward a proposal. It makes sense that, as part of that development, there would be a public leisure centre because there is nothing there. Children looking to play football have no grass pitch in the area. Thousands of young children who want to be able to play football have to go to Crumlin to get training on a grass pitch or even a full-size astroturf pitch. It is really important that investment is made in communities.	spk_30

It is a very interesting brief and I wish him well in it. As Israel's fanatics take over its Government and shooting Palestinians becomes a national sport for the Israeli security forces, the Irish Government needs to go beyond expressing concern and condemnation. The apartheid Israeli Finance Minister recently said: ""I may be a far-right person, a homophobe, [a] racist, [a] fascist, but my word is my bond."" Mr. Itamar Ben-Givr, the new Minister of National Security, who was considered too dangerous to draft into the Israel Defense Forces and was convicted of incitement to racism, is now looking to bring in the death penalty. I heard the Tánaiste condemn the introduction of the death penalty in Iran.Surely the fanatical Israeli Government's calls for the death penalty to be imposed in Israel should be condemned equally and not just condemned but sanctions brought in to ensure that the Israeli Government realises that these measures are completely unacceptable. The new Israeli Government has exposed the myth that Israel is a secular, liberal and enlightened state. The new ministers have no interest in peace, equality or justice; they are more interested in hate, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their home and apartheid. Last year was the deadliest year in the occupied West Bank since records began in 2005. Last year 149 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces. That is nearly double the number killed in 2021. If the start of this year is anything to judge, the number for 2023 will exceed the numbers for 2021 and 2022 combined."	spk_157

It is of vital importance not just to rural TDs but also to urban TDs. It a vital part of our commitment to tackling climate change, to reversing the damage done to our ecosystem over decades and also vital for supporting local communities across rural Ireland and strengthening the local economy. When it comes to forestry in Ireland, the reality is clear; we have been massively failing year after year. The climate action plan suggests that upward of 8,000 ha. of land needs to be planted annually. The Government has set that as the annual afforestation target between 2019 and 2030 yet it is struggling to hit even a quarter of that target. With only 11% of forest areas across the State, we are massively below EU member states where the average is around 40%. We must begin a national conversation on what afforestation should consist of, how it will look and how it will impact and benefit the countryside. We need a clear plan to address the minuscule amount of native woodland across the State. Dubliner Eoghan Daltun has been a strong voice on harnessing the vast potential to be harnessed across Ireland's west coast. In 2009, he bought a 27 acre partly-wooded farm on the Beara Peninsula, a beautiful part of the world. He described it as dying ecologically. Now, over a decade later, it is thriving. The ecological strength of his farm on the Beara Peninsula is in contrast to the nearby Killarney National Park. If you wander across the UNESCO biosphere of Killarney National Park you will find a barren landscape, stripped bare by Sika deer, goats, sheep and, of course, the invasive Rhododendron which provide little or no opportunity for the restoration of that ecosystem. We need to see an effective strategy to remove invasive species from the biosphere. What will be central to the success of the national forestry strategy will be community involvement and community buy-in. We need local communities to be the driving force in afforestation and not international investor funds, the sole  The proposed deal between Coillte and Gresham House has brought about widespread opposition. It has brought together sections of society from right across the State, urban and rural, which are opposed to this proposed deal. There is opposition to this deal from every section of Irish society: environmentalists, farmers, the forestry sector, rural and urban communities. The Government needs to engage and listen to these voices and expert knowledge and we need to make sure that the Gresham House deal can be undone. I strongly urge the Government to reverse the decision and to scrap the deal with Gresham House. I urge it to look after and support farmers and communities right across rural Ireland.	spk_414

I have been meeting with tenants living in flat complexes across Dublin. I attended a meeting earlier today in Pearse House. The level of neglect by the Government and Dublin City Council is horrendous. There are affected flats in Beech Hill, Rathmines, Cuffe Street, Digges Street and York Street. There are too many flat complexes to name individually but I assure the Minister of State that every block of flats has shocking levels of damp and mould. We know that mould has a serious impact on the health of young and old, in particular. A young child died because of mould in a flat in the UK. The time for concern is long gone. We need action now. The chance of the council sorting out this mess and these issues is long gone. The Government needs to intervene directly. It needs to set up a task force with ring-fenced funding for the battle against mould. It is far too serious an issue not to do so. Tenants at Mercer House, Digges Street and York Street deserve better. The climate change funds can be used for insulation to make the flats warm, modern and, crucially, energy efficient. It seems that emission reductions are only for the wealthy. No such schemes are being made available to those in flat complexes. Why not put solar panels on top of flat complexes to heat the flats below? There is none of that innovation because the flats have been, and continue to be, neglected and forgotten. None of the flats has schemes to make them more energy efficient. Every flat should have new secure doors that reduce the need to keep the heating on. Every flat should be insulated and warm. Let us ensure a task force is set up with the funding needed to get rid of the dangerous mould in so many flats.	spk_501

The level of neglect by the Government and Dublin City Council is horrendous. There are affected flats in Beech Hill, Rathmines, Cuffe Street, Digges Street and York Street. There are too many flat complexes to name individually but I assure the Minister of State that every block of flats has shocking levels of damp and mould. We know that mould has a serious impact on the health of young and old, in particular. A young child died because of mould in a flat in the UK. The time for concern is long gone. We need action now. The chance of the council sorting out this mess and these issues is long gone. The Government needs to intervene directly. It needs to set up a task force with ring-fenced funding for the battle against mould. It is far too serious an issue not to do so. Tenants at Mercer House, Digges Street and York Street deserve better. The climate change funds can be used for insulation to make the flats warm, modern and, crucially, energy efficient. It seems that emission reductions are only for the wealthy. No such schemes are being made available to those in flat complexes. Why not put solar panels on top of flat complexes to heat the flats below? There is none of that innovation because the flats have been, and continue to be, neglected and forgotten. None of the flats has schemes to make them more energy efficient. Every flat should have new secure doors that reduce the need to keep the heating on. Every flat should be insulated and warm. Let us ensure a task force is set up with the funding needed to get rid of the dangerous mould in so many flats.	spk_501
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-01-26	dail	33	Housing Schemes	dbsect_33	"The problem of mould in flats is not being taken seriously by the Government. We cannot entrust the local authorities to fix this problem which has been there for decades. The homes are passed with just a bit of paint or bleach, which some tenants are given. The days for that are long gone. Government needs to intervene and ensure that the funding is there. The funding can be there if the Government is committed to it. It is not being taken seriously. We need action. We are not seeing action. We have inadequate funding to tackle this serious problem. I believe the Government is overwhelmed by the extent of the mould and neglect in the flats. Glovers Court is not far from here. It was supposed to be retrofitted years ago. Canon Mooney Gardens in Ringsend was also supposed to be treated. That has not happened. There is no real commitment by the Government. It has never been done. People are still living in shocking flats. I spoke to a resident earlier on and he said, ""These flats were built to replace the tenements and now we are living in modern-day tenements"". I just came from a meeting in Pearse House where that was said to me. Residents living in the flats deserve better."	spk_504

It could equally be called the compassion Bill because that is really what it is about. It is about showing compassion to people who find themselves in horrific circumstances, something that none of us would ever like to imagine facing. This will impact a very small number of people and, as the Minister said and everyone would agree, the vast majority of employers will accept that and be understanding but that is not always the case and we must ensure that people have that right. Most workers will probably get ten days but when we talk about this particular issue, we always say, and it is agreed right across the House, that politics is not family-friendly. We have to do everything to make it more family-friendly. The Minister listed off a number of measures which have been taken to make it more family-friendly, so I just cannot understand how the Government could delay this. Having listened to the Minister, and with no disrespect intended, I still do not understand why he could delay this Bill for 12 months. The process will take years. It is imperative that this compassion Bill which shows compassion is started now rather than waiting for 12 months to go to Committee Stage. I still do not understand and perhaps the Minister will make a further contribution and outline clearly why the Bill would be delayed for 12 months because I do not think that most people would understand that. Ideally, the Minister would withdraw that amendment. It is unnecessary to delay the Bill and why would he do so? People are at a very vulnerable point when they lose a child. It is a devastating blow and we have to ensure that people are shown that compassion. Perhaps the Minister will outline again why the Bill will be delayed because it makes no sense. I know that the Minister is a man with compassion which is clear in all of the work he does. I ask that he withdraw the amendment and move this Bill forward as a matter of urgency.	spk_510
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2023-01-18	dail	33	Climate Action Plan 2023: Statements	dbsect_11	Carbon emissions, climate change, the climate action plan, COP26, and COP27 are undoubtedly very important to us all, but they mean very little to those living in Dublin City Council flat complexes. The Government talks about this scheme and that scheme, but none of them impact on residents living in Countess Markievicz House or Whitefriar Gardens. The Government regularly announces how many schemes it has provided to help households to reduce emissions, but the tenants in Bishop Street or Rathmines Avenue do not see or feel any benefit from all these announcements. They are living in neglect and have been neglected for too long. I was in McDonagh House and Pearse House recently meeting with residents and, almost without exception, every flat had serious dampness and mould problems, the level of which has serious health impacts on young and old. One family had an elderly parent who was receiving dialysis three times per week. The seals are broken on the windows and the cost of heating is huge, and this is clearly not healthy for this gentleman. One parent in St. Andrews Court is living in completely overcrowded conditions and has a young child who has a cough that is more like a smoker's cough, which is caused by the mould. Climate measures have to make a difference to residents who have been neglected for years. Carbon emissions, reductions and schemes seem to be for the wealthy. That is what so many residents of flat complexes are telling me. Why not put solar panels on the roof of flats? The climate action plan does not affect families living in flat complexes and we need a change for those families. People living in the flats in Pearse House and Mercer House have been forgotten about and neglected. There needs to be an urgency around ensuring proper, adequate, decent retrofitting for residents living in flat complexes. Let us see real change for those living in flats. Let us see real improvements in the conditions of those living in the flat complexes across Dublin city.	spk_206

It is great there appears to be some light at the end of the tunnel for homeowners for whom this has been an utter nightmare. The devil is in the detail and we will see that detail in time. When it comes to home defects, it is hard to know where to start. Throughout the country, there is no community without a story about defective apartments. So many people scraped together and saved money to buy their dream home. A few years after residents moved into these homes, cracks and leaks started to appear and these cracks and leaks turned the dream into a nightmare. These defects were not created by the homeowners. Homeowners bought their homes in good faith. They bought them because they believed they would be built well because the banks approved their mortgages and the councils that gave many of them mortgages would not have done so if the buildings were defective, one would have thought. The surveyors said they were grand. The glossy brochures said they were dream homes. What could have gone wrong? What went wrong was the Government's light-touch regulation. Developers could put up whatever they wanted because there would be no one out to check on the defects. I spoke to a council official last week who said the lack of regulation gave the green light for junk to be built. All the cracks and defects have appeared and homeowners cannot afford the money required to fix their homes. No one would want to buy the defective homes. In my constituency, there were issues of fire safety in Longboat Quay South and water ingress in Gallery Quay and Poolbeg Quay. The owners of apartments in Poolbeg Quay need to be supported financially to resolve the issues. They should not have to pick up the tab because of the Government's failure. Some owners will be out of pocket to the sum of €20,000 to €25,000. Ordinary families cannot afford this. It is also important not to forget that defective apartments are not all privately owned. Much public housing is also defective. York Street apartments, which are 500 meters from here, would be classed as defective. These apartments are just 15 years old and they received plenty of architectural awards, but awards mean nothing when a person is living in a defective building. Last year, a water tank burst in one of the blocks in York Street apartments and the residents had to move to neighbouring accommodation where they remained for two months. Dublin City Council has spent millions fixing the defects and millions more will have to be spent to remedy these defects. I am regularly contacted by residents living in flats that have chronic mould and dampness. Flats in Whitefriar Street have serious issues. I was contacted by a family living in a flat in St. Andrew's Court on the other side of Merrion Square. The mould and damp in many of these flats is shocking. These flats are defective and unhealthy to live in and need to be pulled down and rebuilt. Young families should not live in these conditions. One child living in overcrowded conditions has what is like a smoker's cough due to the extent of the mould, condensation and dampness. Defective apartments are not all privately owned. The flats in Mercer House, Pearse House and Countess Markiewicz House are beautifully designed but they are not fit for purpose anymore. Their day has come and gone and they need to be refurbished and regenerated. This is what needs to be done for residents in the inner city who have so often been forgotten and neglected by the Government and Dublin City Council.	spk_256
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-12-15	dail	33	Income Eligibility for Social Housing Supports: Statements	dbsect_35	I, too, extend my Christmas wishes to the Minister, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy James Browne, and all the Houses of the Oireachtas staff, who have kept the wheels turning over the past year and do a fantastic job. The increase in income thresholds is very welcome. I believe the levels should be greater than what is proposed. Inflation, which will continue, was mentioned. The thresholds have to be more flexible. We have called for an increase for years. For too long, workers and families have been penalised for getting slight pay rises into better paying jobs. I spoke to a number of employers this week who said they looked to increase staff wages but their employees said not to do that. It is very important we ensure that people get a fair reward for work that does not hinder their prospects of getting a new home. It is always shocking to see the councils, as has been mentioned, being very rigid in removing people from the housing lists. People are then caught. They cannot afford to rent, certainly not in Dublin Bay South, where rents are exorbitant. I looked at Daft.ie earlier; it is €4,500 a month for a three-bedroom apartment in that location. When you think about it, it is daft that any family would have to pay that. People are then caught in limbo in low-standard accommodation. They are trying to rent, cannot get public housing and cannot afford to buy their own place. That is a huge issue. I welcome the increase. It should be more. The retrospective period should be longer because people have come to me, and other colleagues, regarding that.	spk_276
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-12-15	dail	33	Housing Policy	dbsect_37	As the Minister of State will be aware, Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 has been the backbone of the provision of much-needed social housing stock across the State for many years. Without the requirement that each private developer provides a percentage of social housing for the local authority, it is hard to imagine how much worse off the housing crisis would be. These housing units have been essential in trying to protect inner-city communities that are being pushed out by big high-tech companies. The Government does not like to hear any criticism of high-tech companies, but there is another view of the high-tech companies in the inner-city community of Pearse House, Markievicz House and Mercer House and this is due to the huge, negative impact these companies have had on housing for the local community. To see developers using loopholes in outdated legislation is infuriating for local communities in the city who, time and again, feel forgotten and left behind by the State. The moment the previous Minister scrapped the height guidelines in 2018, it created a hole in housing legislation for developers to exploit and that is exactly what they are doing. Two years ago, I introduced a Bill aimed at plugging this hole, blocking this exploitation and ensuring there would be fair treatment of the local community and developers building homes. My proposal was on foot of a local campaign in Ringsend that was built around the planning permission that was granted for the development of a seven-storey apartment block on York Road, Ringsend. Having been granted planning permission for the seven-storey block, the developer was exempt from providing social units. He then reapplied for planning permission to change the build to a 15-storey apartment block. Had the developer been successful in this application, it would have resulted in 48 new homes and no public housing for the local community. This application was blocked because of the amazing campaign put together by the local community in Ringsend. In a housing crisis, to allow such blatant dodging of Part V requirements is bonkers. My Bill was opposed at the time with the then Minister saying that York Road was a one-off development and that no other developments would use this loophole. Since then, I am aware of developments on Lime Street and Sandwith Street both of which used the size of the site to be exempt from providing any social units. Both these developments are within 15 minutes of Leinster House. How many examples of the use of this loophole are seen throughout the State? I do not know, but I can guarantee you if they are being built 15 minutes away from the Dáil, they are being built right across the State, particularly in built-up urban areas. What happened on York Road was certainly not a one-off. Will the Government review the position it has taken in the past and address the need to update this flawed legislation, thereby ensuring the gap that developers use to exploit loopholes in the planning laws are closed? If there is already an exemption for small developments of fewer than ten homes, why is there also an exemption based on the area on the ground? That is the loophole developers are using.	spk_348
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-12-15	dail	33	Housing Policy	dbsect_37	The last few sentences of the Minister of State's response provided some bit of hope, because there is clearly an issue around developments being exempted due to the site being 0.1 hectares. The scrapping of height restrictions has led to applications for ten- and 15-storey buildings. There was an application for a 15-storey building in Ringsend with public housing available on the site but that did not happen. We need to ensure this loophole is closed. There are other sites next to Pearse House flats, which are not too far from here, and Leo Fitzgerald House that are exempt from the Part V provision of public housing. It means local communities and families will miss out. There are many cases of three generations of families living in two-bedroom flats, such as in Pearse House.In one case, five people were living in a one-bedroom flat in Markievicz House until very recently. That is replicated right across the city. Conditions are overcrowded in many flats such as those on Rathmines Avenue, in Mercer House and Whitefriar Gardens. The overcrowding is completely unacceptable and it is equally unacceptable that developers are allowed to exploit loopholes in the legislation to get out of their responsibility to provide public housing for the local community. I acknowledge the work the Minister of State has done. I know she is here regularly. The Minister of State certainly deserves a Christmas break because she has got to be one of the most hard-working Ministers around. Gabhaim buíochas léi and I wish her a happy Christmas.	spk_350

Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-12-13	dail	33	Current Issues Affecting the Health Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_21	Housing and health have become intertwined into one big mess and that has happened on Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil’s watch. Government policies in health and housing over the past decade have brought us to a crisis. We are now facing a brain drain from the health service like we have never seen before. A perpetual crisis in the health service under this Government is forcing nurses and midwives to emigrate. A staggering 65% of nursing graduates are considering emigrating. A third of them have already been approached by overseas agencies for recruitment abroad. When I speak with staff who are working in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, and St. Vincent’s Hospital, Fairview, in my constituency of Dublin Bay South, the loss of healthcare staff to emigration is the number one concern they raise with me. Nurses and midwives working in these hospitals should be able to live relatively close by. It is just not right that they are completely priced out of the housing market. It is not right that these essential workers are forced to commute for hours to reach work each day. The rents and prices around St. Vincent's Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital give staff no hope. The high-tech boom has contributed to the forcing of staff and working families out of their communities. These essential workers do incredible work every day caring for patients but year after year the Government fails to look after them. We need to see a step change in how the Government views nurses and midwives. We all remember the last Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and his comments around financial penalties against striking nurses and for nurses and midwives who are merely seeking better conditions. Sinn Féin has a plan to fix the housing emergency. Sinn Féin also has a plan to fix the health emergency and we need a change of Government for that to happen. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Paul Donnelly that we must ensure the Geoffrey Shannon report on the St. John Ambulance is published as a matter of urgency. St. John Ambulance should not be allowed to sit on this particular report. Sex abuse survivors should not be silenced.	spk_440

I thank the Minister of State for his patience. Life is hard enough for children with disabilities. Families with children who have disabilities are already creaking under the pressure. As the Minister of State will know, waiting lists for children are growing at an unprecedented rate. More than 18,000 children are now on the waiting list for initial contact with the children's disability network team, CDNT. According to the latest data available up to the end of September, 18,473 children are on these waiting lists, an increase of more than 1,000 from the end of May. That is a shocking increase of 6% in only four months. If this trend continues, waiting this could rise by more than 15% in a year which is an enormous toll to put on any children with a disability and their families. These waiting lists are longest in Dublin in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 9 and CHO 7. In CHO 9, I understand 2,295 children have been waiting for more than a year for initial contact with the disability network team. In CHO 7, 1,323 children have been waiting more than 12 months for their initial contact. In total, 2,991 children are on this waiting list in CHO 9 which covers north Dublin and a devastating 77% of those children have been waiting more than a year for contact with their team. That is simply not acceptable and I know the Minister of State will not try to defend it. He knows as well as I do that that is unacceptable and must change. There must be an invention. By comparison in CHO 7, 2,456 children are waiting for contact, meaning that 54% of children have been waiting for more than a year in CHO 7. That sounds good in comparison to CHO 9, but it is not. It is devastating for the children and their families that they are waiting for so long. The CDNTs are supposed to help families and children navigate their way through the health system but it does not seem to be working in many cases I know of a young lad Seán who has autism. He is from Ringsend and was going to school outside the area in Blackrock. He ended up having to go to a primary healthcare clinic for dental work.The confusion and lack of services for him was just ridiculous. It should not matter where a child goes to school. He is only going to school in Blackrock because there is not a school locally for him and for children with his disability. There are very long waiting times and there is a very significant problem in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4 and CHO 8, which cover the midlands, Cork and Kerry.

It is also welcome that the Minister is welcoming it and will work with it on Committee Stage. Dublin Bay is hugely important to everyone in this country, not just people living close to the coast. It is an environmental jewel that needs to be protected. During Covid, many people discovered swimming and how important and healthy is sea swimming. Before Covid, I would not have gone near the coast but for some reason it was probably one of the few activities you could take up during Covid. It is so healthy and really helps your mental health. I find it really good for re-setting the system. This Bill would see the bathing season of Dublin Bay changed to cover the entire year. It is important to acknowledge that in 2008, our constituency colleague John Gormley set out minimum requirements for bathing water testing under the Bathing Water Quality Regulations 2008. That was a first, was needed and showed great foresight. It is something we need to build on. Times have changed, things have moved on and we must move on with them. An authority such as that proposed would be worth looking at. Raw sewage was mentioned. I sometimes go swimming out at Red Rock. I only recently discovered that 40 houses near Howth are spilling sewage into Dublin Bay. Irish Water has indicated that it will be 2025 before a treatment facility is put in place to address the fact that sewage from these 40 homes goes into the bay. Dublin City Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council take a much more proactive approach and test all year round, including several popular swimming sites that are not designated as bathing locations. My understanding is that there are just two designated bathing areas, Dollymount and Sandymount, and four non-designated, Merrion, Shellybanks, the Half Moon and the North Bull Island causeway. Effectively it is almost impossible to swim at the Merrion site. I know the last three tests have been red flags. In the Dublin City Council area, there are only two designated bathing areas and four non-designated bathing areas that are also tested. We need a live dashboard that monitors leaks from the Ringsend treatment plant, which was mentioned. This has a significant impact. Almost every time it rains, raw sewage flows out into the bay and has an adverse effect on the entire bay. Almost every year, ectocarpus, a foul-smelling algae bloom, is found along Sandymount Strand. It makes Sandymount Strand almost unusable for walkers. All you can say is that the smell is disgusting. It smells like raw sewage. In Dollymount, they scrape it off and pile it high. I have worked with Dublin City Council on this and challenged it about it. It maintains that ectocarpus is a natural algae bloom and of course it most certainly is but the amount of this foul-smelling algae is completely unacceptable. I am convinced and Dublin City Council begrudgingly admits that it has something to do with overflow. The nitrate from the raw sewage feeds the algae so we have vast volumes of algae, which sometimes makes Sandymount Strand unusable. It is something we need to address and acknowledge because I do not believe Dublin City Council has fully acknowledged or is willing to acknowledge openly that this is the case. As has been said, the wastewater treatment plant is already damaging the environment. Even when the works are done to complete the additional capacity, it will just be at capacity for the people it serves. If there is any heavy rain, and living in Ireland there is a fairly good chance of a lot of rain, there is ongoing contamination of Dublin Bay by raw sewage. The amount of waste from the Liffey, the Grand Canal and the Tolka that flows into Dublin Bay is horrendous. The Government needs to increase funding for projects such as Jimmy Murray's Liffey Sweeper project. It is a positive and constructive project that works and employs local people, including young people who might find it challenging to get jobs in other sectors. This is a really good project. It is a win-win. There are no downsides to this. It cleans the Liffey. I saw that Flossie Donnelly, who does a lot of work around cleaning up the bay, posted a photo of a young seal on a mattress that had been swept into Dublin Bay. It would not take a huge amount of resources to fund the Liffey Sweeper and it is really effective. Dublin City Council has invested in it. It is important to acknowledge the commitment of Dublin Port, which has shown its support for the bay in general and the Liffey Sweeper project.From more than 11 sampling trips undertaken by the Liffey Sweeper, a total of 4,114 kg of debris was extracted. Indeed, 70% of that waste removed from the River Liffey is recycled. If it was not taken out of the River Liffey, it would end up in Dublin Bay. We cannot just look at Dublin Bay in isolation. We have to look at the waterways that feed into it, and we must expand projects like the Liffey Sweeper to cover the Dodder and the Tolka rivers and the Clontarf estuary. I know the Liffey Sweeper has been used in Grand Canal Dock to clean it up. In the Liffey and Dublin Bay, tidal movements move waste on, but in the canal areas such as Grand Canal Dock and George's Dock, the waste just sits there. It has to be taken out by hand or net. The Liffey Sweeper does that and the workers do a fantastic job. The Tolka River and Grand Canal Dock are probably two of the most polluted waters in Ireland, according to new research published this year. The biosphere co-ordinator for Dublin City Council, Mr. Dean Eaton, has been mentioned by other speakers. I met him a number of weeks ago and he gave us a presentation. The Dublin Bay biosphere partnership is overseen by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Dublin Port and Fáilte Ireland. It is a very good initiative. It has to be given teeth, as has been proposed. I know Mr. Eaton goes to great lengths to promote Dublin Bay in terms of education, awareness, tourism, conservation, research, recreation and cultural heritage. He has done a huge amount of invaluable work with very limited resources, and he has published a biodiversity conservation and research strategy for 2022 to 2026. It is most important that all Members participating in this discussion take a look at that and take it in. It is an important guiding piece of work. I underline the need to support projects like the Liffey Sweeper to ensure that the Liffey and Dublin Bay are clean. It is a good community project.	spk_299
Chris Andrews	47	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-12-07	dail	33	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_14	With each passing week, the situation in Palestine becomes worse and worse. Israel, an apartheid terror state, makes that community an area of terror and fear for anybody who happens to be Palestinian in their homeland. Two weeks ago, apartheid forces dragged children from a primary school in Masafer Yatta to make way for bulldozers. It is another example of a community being ethnically cleansed from their homeland by apartheid Israel. This school was funded by the European Union, yet the EU says nothing. Since last week, more than ten Palestinians have been murdered in the occupied West Bank. In some of these cases, which the Minister of State may have seen, people were executed in cold blood for all to see. International law means nothing to Israel. Unfortunately, the European Union, of which Ireland is a key member, is unwilling to hold Israel to account. With the Taoiseach's term coming to an end this month, what message has Ireland brought to European Council meetings condemning Israeli apartheid? Has the Taoiseach ever taken concerns raised on countless occasions in this House to those Council meetings? Has the Government ever raised concerns about Israel defying international law at European Council meetings? During the term of this Taoiseach and the Minister of State, 500 Palestinians have been murdered by Israel. Apartheid Israel has murdered 500 people on their watch. Of those, 100 were children. Has the Minister of State ever raised this issue in the European Council? Has he condemned Israel at European Council meetings? One hundred of the 500 people murdered by apartheid Israel were children. This year, 2022, is set to be the deadliest year in the occupied West Bank since records of killing began in 2005. Israel is a terror state. There is administrative detention and no right of return. Stealing Palestinian land on a daily basis is sanctioned by the state. There are illegal settlements and shoot-to-kill policies, as we saw as recently as last week. There is daily racism. Civil society organisations have been designated as terror groups by Israel. There is daily apartheid and Israel maintains the biggest open-air prison in the world, namely, the Gaza Strip. Israel is getting more and more belligerent. Religious extremists have key roles in the new government. What action has Ireland taken against Israel and the crimes it commits? With Ireland's term on the UN Security Council coming to an end, what has Ireland done to say we object to Israeli terror?	spk_170

Every Minister works hard but the Minister for Health goes above and beyond in his commitment. I support the Bill. There are good things in it and it is an important Bill. However, it will not build trust in the health system, where trust is in short supply. It will not build trust in the cancer screening process or the CervicalCheck system. It will not build trust in any of those. As has been said previously, we have no issues with what is in the Bill or the amendments but we have an issue with the process and the absence of a statutory duty of candour in the Bill. There has to be transparency. Patients have to be at the centre of this legislation, and the health system. Patients are vulnerable by their very nature and they need to be supported. Patient rights are a crucial human right. Patient rights are essential pillars in providing good healthcare and promoting good medical practices.A core element of patient care is to allowing patients to make decisions about their own care. To do that, they need all the information, whether it is good or bad, and they should not have to request that. There needs to be more clarity around the process. Patients are vulnerable; they are not well. They may have little family support. In my experience, particularly recently, I have found that medical practitioners can be quite dismissive of patients, particularly older patients. I have a letter from a woman who wrote to me who is in her mid-80s. In the late 1970s she went for a tubal ligation in a Munster hospital; one would imagine that this would have been a pretty standard operation. A number of years later, she found out that menopause was hastened due to the operation. She found out when she got the menopause that she had a"" full ovary removal"" in her words. She is still traumatised by it. At the time, she got on with it. She had young children and was under a lot of pressure. Even now, when she reflects on her life, she is traumatised by it. The fact that this happened without her knowledge was devastating and had a huge negative impact on her life. She wants to know what happened; she is still not sure. She is looking for that information. This is replicated throughout the health system, which is why confidence in it is low. This lady was let down by the health system. She should have been told automatically. She should not have possibly found out by mistake years later. It is unacceptable. The Bill is being fast-tracked. I accept there is a time and place to fast-track legislation but this is not one of those Bills. We need to ensure that patient safety and information are prioritised. This is an important Bill. It does not place an obligation on a provider or clinician to inform a patient of the right to a Part 5 review at the point of diagnosis. This can and needs to be done; it is essential. If we are going to rebuild confidence in the health system and the cervical cancer screening system, this information must be automatic and there must be a process by which people can get information. It does not matter how this or any woman discovers that there was a mistake or a procedure was carried out without their knowledge. Patients need to be told. It is completely unacceptable. In the words of a survivor, this legislation would have made sure that ""nobody would have found out what was going on with CervicalCheck"". The bottom line is that this is not giving everyone the right to information, unless they seek it. It does not place an obligation on a clinician or a service provider to inform a patient when an error, mistake or inaccuracy is discovered. Whether that is minor, within the margin of error or a severely negligent misreading, there is no obligation on anybody to tell anyone that they found something wrong. This is self-regulation. It will not work in the health system, which has been proven in the past. Self-regulation generally does not work and it certainly does not work in the health system. The right to information needs to be introduced."	spk_252

I also welcome his candour. It is clear that the Minister is listening. With regard to anonymisation and having listened to Deputy Kelly, regardless of whether that it is to be done here or in the Seanad, we have to take another step and ensure that people can sign up to what is in the Bill. That is very important. The whole debate is very important. It is very important that the Bill is right. Families will understand if it takes a bit longer as long as we get it right. This is key. The devil is always in the detail. It is important that the Minister spells out the detail relating to anonymisation. Patients need to be elevated above the processes. As I mentioned earlier, the public does not have confidence in the health system, the cancer screening process or the CervicalCheck process. There is a serious lack of confidence among the public in this regard. This is why it is very important that the details of the Bill are done right..

It is to the credit of the Minister of State and Government that it is being introduced now. Successive Governments fail to act on it every year. It is welcome and commendable that the legislation is in the Dáil now. I commend the Minister of State. As a society, we often fail to address and to see gambling for the cancer that it is for many people. We often view gambling as harmless fun, including accumulators and bets when people go to the races. It is a social thing, but it is dangerous for many people. In sport, betting companies are often viewed as vital sponsorship for clubs. The GAA has led by example with its socially responsible approach to gambling. In 2018, the GAA voted for an outright ban on gambling sponsorship. Since then, it has developed awareness campaigns about gambling aimed at its members and players. Within the FAI, more and more League of Ireland clubs refuse to take gambling companies as sponsors. I know that the club in Drogheda has turned down gambling companies. This is welcome. The days of jersey sponsorship by betting companies should be in the past. I welcome the legislation to finally bring about a ban on these sponsorships in sport. The Gambling Awareness Trust indicates that approximately 55,000 people in the State have serious gambling disorders. We have the highest online gambling losses 	spk_147

However, a few years into living in their new home, it has turned into a nightmare because they find their home is not safe to live in. Of course, they cannot sell as they cannot afford the cost of making things right. As has been said, they had no hand, act or part in causing the defects. The people who caused the defects are long gone and the Government wants the residents to pick up the tab for the Government’s light and no-touch regulation.

This is a really important issue and affects every section of society. We need more discussions as to how we approach the use of drugs in this country. We need to hear from everybody. Everybody has to have a voice on this. Whether we agree or disagree with them, we have to ensure that people are engaged in this discussion. The best place for that, as has been said, is in the citizens' assembly. It is really important. A citizens' assembly allows people to have a voice. It teases out all the complex issues. We have to ensure, as I said, that nobody's point of view is considered invalid. So many families and individuals are directly affected by the failed approach this State has taken to drug use. We need a step change in how we approach drug use. We need to see a health-led approach that has harm reduction and prevention at its core, not the criminalisation of those with addiction problems who need help and support.Someone who robs a bank is a criminal. Someone who has an addiction is not a criminal. Someone who smokes some weed occasionally is not a criminal. We need to treat this as a health issue. Portugal introduced decriminalisation and the sky did not fall in. People's lives were saved because the level of overdoses reduced. This proposal is not radical. What we are calling for would not make us an outlier in terms of European policy. It has become an essential change of policy and we have to adopt it. During the Covid pandemic, we regularly heard that we have to believe in the science. I understand the World Health Organization recommends decriminalisation. Just as with Covid-19 and the surrounding issues, we must ensure that we believe the science around drug use and decriminalisation. 	spk_29

The vast majority of us realise we have to reduce our emissions and cut our carbon footprint, and urgent action is needed across the State. We have seen much talk with this Government on the action that is needed. I agree with the previous Government speaker in saying that the pace is glacial. We need a fair retrofit plan which will help meet our climate targets and when I say a ""fair retrofit plan"" I am speaking on behalf of our constituents. I am speaking about families living in Glover's Court, Mercer House and Pearse House. The conditions they are living in are completely unacceptable and, in many cases, shocking. They do not see any change. Egypt and Cairo are 6,000 km away and it is even further if one is living in a flat complex in Dublin, because they do not see any likelihood of their homes being retrofitted or insulated. Of course, the council will say that it is doing what it can with the resources it has. Ultimately, however, the Government is not giving the resources that are required and needed to retrofit flat complexes with the speed that is required. Many of the communities we represent are being excluded and forgotten about. Working families are facing very significant pressures with the cost of living and the vast majority do not have €20,000 or €30,000 to invest in a deep retrofit. Dublin City Council tenants living in Pearse House or Leo Fitzgerald House cannot insulate their own homes as the council will not let them. They have to wait for the Government and it has firmly placed residents living in the flat complexes in the back of the bus. It is highly unfair that families are being left in the conditions they are subjected to by Dublin City Council and by the Government. Many of these flats have the worst energy ratings going, where many of these homes were built in the 1940s and 1950s and have little or no insulation, with a heat loss that is insanely high. The Government has to commit to resource Dublin City Council to ensure that the flat complexes and regeneration are fast-tracked, otherwise we have failed as a society to support Dublin City Council’s housing tenants."	spk_349

It is good to see him looking well. The Minister of State has identified all the challenges and blockages. What we need now is real action and not just observations. We also need a strategy, as throwing money at it is not a strategy. Home care is an essential service, and without a workforce strategy, there will be no improvement in home care delivery. The Government throwing money at it is not a strategy. The failure to put a home care workforce strategy in place is pushing patients into hospitals when they could be cared for in their own homes. Everyone, including the Minister of State, knows the problems, but we are not getting the action we need. We need delivery. We have had enough of reports and reviews. Our communities need to see the reform of the home care sector. What we have now is effectively a race to the bottom. We need a career pathway that will allow home care staff to develop their skills and train to deliver a quality service, and this needs to be recognised. There needs to be a collective pay agreement for home care workers that takes into account travel times, as mentioned by the Minister of State, so why has she not done this? We all know this needs to be done. We need action. We also need to see home care workers having access to work visas in the same way as home care workers in hospitals and nursing homes. Unless that is done, there will be a haemorrhaging of home care workers into nursing homes and hospital settings, which will ensure there is never an improvement in home care delivery. Providers are haemorrhaging staff because the Government has not introduced the necessary standards and requirements to ensure people want to work and will work in home care services. There needs to be a level playing field for all providers of home care, such as in hospitals, home care settings and nursing homes. We do not have a level playing field now. Home care workers cannot access visas, which means home care companies are training staff for nursing homes, the HSE and the hospitals.	spk_130
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-10-27	dail	33	Energy Security: Statements	dbsect_34	The energy security problems we face are the product of the Government's failure to prepare and plan in advance. When one looks at the housing crisis, the pressure around accommodating Ukrainian refugees, the mismanagement of our health system and various other issues, it is not surprising that the Government has failed to plan in advance in relation to energy security. The Government has failed to deliver the necessary power stations to deliver significant generation capacity through renewables and gas storage facilities. It has been clear for years that our energy demand would increase substantially. The war in Ukraine has made it painfully clear how poorly developed we are in terms of energy security. However, we are much more fortunate than many of our EU partners. We have very little dependence on Russian gas. Our gas comes from the North Sea in Britain and the Corrib gas field. Energy demand has shot up by 12% in the past five years and this Government's red-carpet policy towards data centres has fuelled much of this demand. It is staggering to think that data centres now consume as much electricity as every house in rural Ireland. Since 2016 EirGrid has been warning of an increasing tightness between supply and demand but the Government spent six years not listening. There was a clear failure to put a plan into action in order to be prepared for what we are now facing. The energy crisis has clearly exposed the failings in the Government's approach to energy, including the rampant privatisation of our energy sector, with State assets such as Bord Gáis fully sold off. Now we see record profits being reported by the likes of Bord Gáis in the middle of this crisis. The windfall profits of energy companies should be going back into energy development, into developing secure and sustainable energy in communities across the State. Instead, these profits are lining the pockets of shareholders while ordinary workers and their families are struggling to pay huge energy bills.  The ESB has been at the core of secure electricity generation to every corner and community in this State. For many years, our energy prices were among the lowest in the EU until the ESB had to set prices higher to encourage competition in the market. As a result, electricity prices have gone from being among the lowest to now being among the highest in the EU. This is a State-owned company making record profits in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. It is hard to believe. Just like in housing, the energy market has failed to provide lower and more competitive prices for workers. We have already seen moves in EU states such as France to bring energy companies back under State ownership. To put an end to the price gouging we are currently experiencing, we need to see this Government take proactive steps in energy development and not wait until the last moment to react. Achieving energy security can create massive opportunities for communities across the island, especially for young people, in the form of highly skilled jobs with good or very good pay and conditions. Working families across the State need to feel secure coming into this winter. Across the State more than 200,000 households are in electricity arrears. Thousands of families are being pushed to the limit paying these bills. This is a clear result of failure by this Government to plan for our energy security. Many people using pre-pay meters are given no choice by their landlords, and now some are being left to ration their electricity. I hear from constituents that the process of switching from pre-pay is effectively impossible. They wait over an hour to try to speak to an operator only to be suddenly disconnected. Most people do not have the free time to sit around waiting for over an hour in the hope of speaking to someone. It is simply not good enough. Workers and families need to feel safe and secure during this coming winter.	spk_305

According to new data from the Central Statistics Office there are 37,000 vacant homes in Dublin alone. That does not count Dublin City Council vacant homes. Within a short distance from here, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I could bring you to 50 empty flats that could be used if they were brought back to life. It is painfully clear to all who live in the city and those commuting in and out that many of these homes have been left empty for years. Those years of neglect are dragging back the city and communities they are built in. These vacant and neglected homes are being left empty amid the worst housing crisis the State has ever faced. There are thousands upon thousands of people crying out for the chance to have a home in their community, where they grew up and among their family and friends. Sinn Féin has long called for a vacant homes tax in the face of Government opposition. A vacant homes tax must not exclude derelict property and must apply a rate for long-term vacancy. We need an effective vacant homes tax that will push vacant homes back onto the market. The Minister with responsibility for sports also announced a €35 million package to help sports clubs over this winter. That is absolutely welcome. It is really important that clubs are supported through this crisis. However, over a month has passed. Clubs are really struggling and waiting for clarity and communication about how this payment will be distributed. One issue that many small local sports clubs, which we all know about, have raised with me is concern around how the scheme will be rolled out. They are concerned that many of the bigger clubs, which are well resourced in terms of professional supports and professional members, will get the bulk of the funds and the smaller, less well-resourced clubs will get the crumbs. That is a real worry for a lot of small clubs. Bill are mounting fast for clubs. I understand many clubs are reducing the number of nights they train in order to cut the cost of floodlighting and to reduce their energy bills. I seek clarification on how long it will be before there is communication with the clubs on this fund. Also connected, last week the heavy rainfall affected many of the grass pitches across the country. Particularly in Dublin, the parks authorities called off a lot of pitches, which means they cannot be played on. That really highlights the underinvestment in all-weather sports facilities. We need to ensure investment in them. We need all-weather sports facilities and they are not there. We have grass pitches and all they do is cut the grass on them. They do not manage those pitches.	spk_272

There have been zero consequences following these murders.

The rate at which Israel has been inflicting a cruel system of apartheid on the Palestinian people has been intensifying. It is easy to see why this is the case following the comments from European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, when she stated, ""Our shared culture and values have created a deep connection between Europe and Israel.""

It is also a credit to Mr. Jonathan Hill, the CEO of the FAI. Senior management in the FAI also deserves great credit. The new regime in the FAI has in many ways embraced women's football. That is important. I also congratulate Ballinteer St. John's on winning the senior camogie final last Sunday. That team did not get there by chance either but did so as a result of hard work, commitment and a great management team. I acknowledge that.	spk_219

I congratulate the Minister on his Bill. I was intending to congratulate him last. Work-life balance is important. In that context, sports facilities are also important. Sport affects our emotional, physical and mental health. We have for decades under-invested in sports and sports facilities. We need to ensure those sports facilities are invested in. The €35 million the Government has allocated for the energy costs clubs will face is important and welcome. However, that payment needs to be rolled out as a matter of urgency. Clubs such as Cambridge FC do not have the space they need to train and improve their players. There is a lack of facilities in neighbourhoods such as Kevin Street. There are no recreational facilities for the public to access in that area. Such facilities are very limited. The technological university property is up for sale and that is something we should be considering in order to ensure a proper publicly accessible recreation centre in the community.	spk_221
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-10-13	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_33	The Bill is very important. As my colleague has said, it is welcome and a positive step in the right direction. I, too, commend the tireless campaigning of Eve McDowell and Una Ring. These women have shown immense bravery and commitment in campaigning for stalking to be a stand-alone offence. Both of them were victims of stalking. They saw at first hand how the charges stalkers face under the current legislation are grossly inadequate. The same is true of the sentencing options. When one reads the accounts of the terror and horror these women endured, it is unimaginable. Una Ring's stalker was eventually caught by the Garda in a surveillance operation while he was breaking into her home with a crowbar and duct tape. His sentence started at nine years but he ended up getting just five years. That is shockingly inadequate justice in the context of the terror that he inflicted. The Bill provides a legal basis for a stand-alone offence of stalking. It will amend the current offence of harassment and provide for court orders to restrain stalking behaviour, as well as procedural protections for victims during the court process. The Bill also introduces stand-alone offences in respect of non-fatal strangulation and suffocation. The new stalking offence covers any conduct that puts the victim in fear of violence or causes the victim serious alarm and distress that has a substantial adverse impact on his or her usual day-to-day activities. The introduction of special measures in court settings for victims of stalking and non-fatal strangulation has been strongly welcomed. In the context of deeply traumatising acts of violence, these measures will finally prevent accused persons confronting their victims in court. The measures are long overdue. As I stated, I very much welcome the Bill and the zero-tolerance approach being taken in respect of this offence. I wish to highlight the ongoing street violence on City Quay. Residents have to put up with ongoing street violence and harassment. They are being held hostage. The gardaí in Pearse Street station have done a significant amount and engaged in a meaningful way. Superintendent Dermot McKenna has done a fantastic job in meeting residents, trying to resolve the matter and putting resources into the issue. The local gardaí are doing a fantastic job but they do not have enough resources. More resources need to be put into these communities in order to put an end to this random street violence - some people call it antisocial behaviour - which is having a devastating effect on the City Quay community. I ask the Minister to ensure that resources are put in place to address it.	spk_253

Families are struggling and, as has previously been said, households are having to decide whether to eat each day. Businesses are also under great pressure. However, it is also important not to forget that sports clubs around the country play an important role in improving our mental, emotional and physical health and that they are also under great pressure. I acknowledge the Government's allocation of €35 million for sports clubs. It is important and welcome but it was announced two weeks ago and clubs are still waiting for clarity on and communication about how that payment will be distributed. There is a concern that the €35 million will go to clubs that have a large number of professional members and that smaller and less well funded and resourced clubs will miss out. We have to ensure that does not happen. With regard to swimming, a national swimming strategy is being formulated while, at the same time, swimming clubs are very concerned that they will have to close. It is not cheap to run a swimming pool. Clarity will be needed as to whether swimming pools will close over the winter months. Sports clubs are switching to training one day a week to ensure the cost of running the flood lights will not put them out of business and into massive debt. Swimming is one of the most popular physical activities across all ages. It is really important that swimming pools not be allowed to close. Pools like those in Rathmines and Markievicz Sports and Fitness Centre need to be funded. We need to ensure these facilities are supported throughout the winter months.	spk_193
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-10-05	dail	33	Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_16	While the Bill is largely technical in nature, it is very much welcome. Many students leave Ireland annually to go to Britain to study their chosen medical degree. It is only right and fitting that the Bill removes the road blocks before people who hold a British medical degree to availing of medical intern posts here. This is the right direction in which we need to move to attract more doctors into the HSE. Our health service faces continuing pressure brought on by inadequate staffing. While the Bill is a step in the right direction, much stronger measures are needed. We are losing Irish doctors at an unbelievable rate. Some 402 of them obtained Australian visas in the first five months of this year alone. That is nearly double the figure for the whole of 2019. While this may be a shocking statistic to many, it is hardly surprising to those working in healthcare. A recent survey of non-consultant hospital doctors carried out by the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, clearly showed why so many are leaving. A staggering 96.8% of those doctors have experienced mental health conditions relating to or made worse by their work and working conditions. Some 80% had concerns for their own mental health and 78% were at risk of burning out. While the Bill falls short in its failure to provide regulation of the home care sector, the sector is in desperate need of professional regulation. This call is being made not only by workers and unions, but by HIQA. One family I know has serious issues retaining home care staff. I raised this previously. The individual needs two carers at a time and uses a care company that appears to be very well run and fair to staff and pays well. Of course, the company is picking up the slack from the HSE and carrying out the work on its behalf. The HSE will call the company and ask whether it has a carer to go out to this family and the carer goes out to look after the individual. However, there is a difficulty for the family and the care company whom I met the week before last. The company said that while it was doing everything it can by paying staff well, giving them all the necessary training and working with them through the various training required, it is losing them to HSE roles and nursing homes. The company has staff for six or seven months before they leave. One carer would not show up and another carer cannot do everything by himself or herself. I know that people are saying it is the sector and staff are not being paid well enough. Maybe that is the case but there are companies that are paying well enough and they should not be penalised for being good employers. It has a considerable impact on them because they are getting dragged in by the people who are not paying the proper rates or being good employers. I know it is complex but families should not be subjected to this. The alternative is State care, which is significantly more expensive. I know the Minister of State knows and realises this. She has not come down from some strange planet. She works with people in this area and has heard it more than I have. However, we very much need to ensure there is some level of fair play for care companies. Staff should get visas. People leave for the HSE to get visas. If that could be applied to home care, maybe it would make a difference.	spk_240
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-10-04	dail	33	Housing for All Update: Statements	dbsect_10	Housing for All is a good name but it is not delivering for all. It is not delivering for families and workers in the flat complexes. It is not delivering for families and workers in the flats who are paying significant rents. They do not get them for free. I know the Minister of State knows this but it will be a surprise to many. There is an assumption that people living in the flats get them for free. That is clearly not the case. They work hard to pay the rent. It is really important to remember that these are the same families who made up the front line during the pandemic. If it had not been for the workers and families in the flats, there would not have been a front line during the pandemic. The flats have little or no insulation, as the Minister knows. Many of them have dampness and mould, and many are like wind tunnels. There is an ongoing problem with rats and flooding, with sewage backing up into people's kitchens. It is absolutely unacceptable. I can say confidently that the flat complexes will be the last to be retrofitted and insulated. I am convinced that the view of the Government is that people living in public housing will get everything last and will have to wait. It shows the attitude of the Government towards people living in public housing. Housing for All is not delivering for homeless people either. As has been mentioned, over 10,800 people are now homeless. Over 3,000 children are homeless. This will have a huge impact on families for generations. It is now well established that the children of people who experience homelessness are more likely to face homelessness again in the future. Therefore, this is not just a problem of homelessness today; it is also a problem we are storing up for tomorrow. Homelessness is a considerable challenge, and the Housing for All plan does not deliver for people in homelessness.	spk_193
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-09-28	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 6: General (Resumed)	dbsect_19	Last week, in this Chamber, I raised the urgent need for intervention for the sporting community to ease the enormous burden that sports clubs, sporting facilities and swimming pools are currently facing. I welcome the announcement of a fund of €35 million to help sporting communities to deal with rising energy costs, which are an issue for floodlights, heating and, particularly, swimming pools. Like everything, the devil is in the detail. We need to make sure that this funding is prioritised for community facilities, with inclusion at the core. We cannot allow a repeat of previous years, where State funding to support swimming pools ended up in the pockets of five-star hotels and high-end facilities that could not be any further removed from the communities they are based in. Some of these luxury swimming pools charge annual membership fees of €1,500 per year and refuse access to children. I am looking for a commitment that no public swimming pools will close this winter as a result of the high energy costs. They are important. As the Minister said, we cannot develop a national swimming strategy and, at the same time, allow pools to close over winter. We have to do everything we can to ensure that this important sporting infrastructure is maintained through the winter. This budget represents yet another missed opportunity to support the grassroots community. We need an urgent step change in how the Government supports grassroots. The grassroots provide the foundation for all our international achievements. While increased funding for high-performance athletes is welcome and is long overdue, this must go hand in hand with increased supports for the grassroots of Irish sports that ensure young people have the opportunity to reach the highest levels of sports participation. We should not allow a huge funding gap to develop between elite and grassroots sport. England invested in winning medals to the detriment of grassroots sports. It is important that that is not replicated here. Sinn Féin's proposal recognises the importance of giving support directly to those involved in grassroots Irish sport.The impact of sport lies in creating a strong and healthy society. We recognise that no child should face a barrier to sport participation due to costs, and that families should not be forced to quit sports as the household bills skyrocket. Sport is very important to everybody, for our mental health, physical health and emotional health. We must ensure that we protect it and invest in it. Our leisure card scheme would provide that support directly to families, and benefit community-based sports groups. The leisure card, to the value of €130 annually, is aimed at making a wide range of activities affordable to every child. It is very important that the provision of special classes is in the local schools in the local community. The large established schools in Dublin, in Dublin 6 and 6W, must now be encouraged and pushed to open up special classes as a matter of urgency. We bus children out of their communities. For example, I believe that €170,000 per day is spent on taxis and buses to send children with special needs and additional needs out of their community in south inner city Dublin. This is something we cannot accept. We must invest in that area. This budget does not do that. Money is being promised, and the funding for the SNAs is very welcome, but the reality is that unless the schools are pushed and encouraged to open up the classes then we will not have an all-inclusive education system in Ireland.	spk_302
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-09-22	dail	33	Sports Funding	dbsect_37	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for coming in. It is safe to say we both agree how important sport is in Irish society. We are a real sporting nation. It is one of the pillars that sustains Irish society. Whether it is at grassroots or amateur level or supporting our elite athletes and teams wherever they represent us, we simply love sport. Sporting organisations play a major role in community development and in fostering stronger social cohesion. An average of one in ten of all adults frequently volunteer within local sporting clubs. The economic value of volunteering for sports alone in 2018 was approximately €1.5 billion per annum. The impact of this is felt far beyond the pitches of our local sports clubs. These additional and often less spoken-of benefits are often some of the most profound. The negative effects of dropping out of supervised sporting activities are also extensive, ranging from increased substance misuse and poor school grades to widening the socioeconomic gap. Research from Sport Ireland has shown the impact that social class has on sporting participation. Only 47% of our children from a lower socioeconomic class grouping will continue some form of sport post primary, while 65% from high social class groupings will participate in post-primary community sport. To ensure that sports continue to play this vital role, support for modern facilities needs to be provided. Despite the clear benefits of sports in our society, Ireland comes bottom of the table in the EU in general when it comes to investing in sports and recreational activities. The Irish Government is a persistent underfunder of sports and recreational activities. Our EU peer group spends on average three times more on sports and recreation than that of Ireland. When the large scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF, was launched in 2018, it was widely welcomed right across the sporting community, which felt that the Government was finally moving in the right direction and introducing adequate funding for major projects. This was seen as a much-needed Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects. Unfortunately, since the first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020, very little has progressed. Approximately €86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals. However, only approximately €900,000 has been paid out to projects. As we all know, building costs have skyrocketed since 2020. Questions must be asked as to how many of these projects are viable under increased building costs. Where projects are facing difficulties, will the Minister of State intervene with support for these sporting infrastructure projects? Capital projects funded through the LSSIF are capped at 70% of the total project. Has the Minister of State considered increasing the cap in view of rising building and construction costs? The cost-of-living crisis is having a severe impact on the financial resources of clubs and national governing bodies, NGBs, across the State. As we enter the winter months, the floodlights will be back on and in action on a nightly basis. This will see increased costs for clubs and local authorities. We will see basketball halls across the State filling up, with basketball being one of our most popular winter sports. Many clubs are being pushed to the edge just trying to cover the cost of energy bills.Can the Minister of State give a commitment that swimming pools, which are expensive to run, will get the funding they need to stay open and that they will not close? Resources for new facilities will be tighter than ever before. Is the Government confident that the 33 proposals awarded funding through the LSSIF will be delivered and when will the Department review on the LSSIF be published?	spk_304

As he said, it kept many clubs afloat and it is important to acknowledge that. However, we are in another pandemic and there is a lot of talk in advance of the budget on household supports, which are vital, as well as business supports. Equally, there will be sports clubs that will need to be kept afloat. If you go to any park the floodlights will be on and swimming pools need to be kept open, even though they are costly. Many clubs that are drawing down these grants and other funds are struggling and it is important that a lifeline is thrown to them. The Minister of State said that 22 of the 33 clubs had progressed their applications but for the rest we need to ensure that where they need funding they get it and the sports organisations should not be allowed to die as a result of a lack of commitment by Government. The Government did not let the clubs go during the pandemic and I seek that sort of commitment and support to be continued during this energy pandemic for sports clubs. As I said earlier, the template we need to follow is that of the League of Ireland and Shamrock Rovers' facilities. We need to ensure those sort of projects and that sort of funding are provided for the League of Ireland, basketball, hockey and cricket.

I can tell him the residents in the flat complexes have been forgotten about and they are freezing and terrified. The condition of the vast majority of flats is very bad. Dampness and mould as a result of poor insulation is rife in many flats. The flats in Mercer House, Pearse Street, Whelan House, Rathmines and many council-owned houses are in a disgraceful condition. Glover Court, as the Minister knows, was supposed to be retrofitted many years ago but, like many plans for the flat complexes, it never happened. In 2022 the flat complexes are like wind tunnels given the unacceptable condition of the doors.One could fit one's hand through many of the old wooden doors that are basically unusable and then the windows are rattling and creating a wind tunnel. The flat complexes need to be prioritised for insulation. We need to increase the funding for local authority flats and houses. Sinn Féin's alternative budget would do this. Equally, we need to see retrofitting prioritised for the flats. There seems to be an attitude that the flats do not matter - that they will be last and we will get around to them at the end. I can tell the House that if it was not for the ordinary working families living in the flat complexes, there would not be a front line during the pandemic. Households living in the flats such as Macken Villas and Beech Hill Villas kept the front line going during the pandemic. A wealthy household can get €25,000 of taxpayer-funded grants for a deep retrofit, while households living in the flats cannot access this. To make matters worse, they would be waiting for years for decent insulation from their landlords, that is, Dublin City Council. Residents need a plan that is fair and is rolled out to those who most need it. Sinn Féin's plan will do that.	spk_313

I think that if a similar motion was put to this House and there was a free vote, a motion of no confidence in An Bord Pleanála would also be passed here. A Minister, one of the Minister of State's colleagues, recently stated that An Bord Pleanála should be disbanded and it is hard to disagree with that. If it is not disbanded, as has been mentioned, that could cause other issues. It needs to be disbanded or radically reformed from the current organisation it is now. This absolute scandal and abuse of the planning process by some board members of An Bord Pleanála has done considerable damage to the faith residents have in the planning process. Confidence in the planning process has never been great but this abuse of power and recent resignations from the board has brought confidence in An Bord Pleanála to an all-time low. Communities do not believe they are getting a fair hearing. Most communities and individuals are already at a disadvantage in the planning process because they are not planning experts. They do not have the resources or the wherewithal to tackle and take on these big development companies and planners. Thus, when they see politically-connected individuals appointed to extremely well-paid jobs and then making decisions that benefit their friends and families, it is greatly upsetting.

Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-07-14	dail	33	Summer Economic Statement: Statements	dbsect_37	The soaring cost of living and the rising inflation rate are showing no let-up, pushing ordinary working families to the pin of their collar. The impact is far-reaching, and it is not just in regard to food and household bills that families are feeling the pressure. The cost-of-living crisis is having an impact on the health and well-being of children throughout the State. I have never had so many parents call me to outline the struggles they face to cover the costs of their children's sporting activities. Week in, week out, parents make more and more sacrifices to provide for their children. The cost of club fees, summer camps, swimming lessons and new boots and gear is adding to the pressure on households. In the past, children used to go and play football in a field and come back when the tea was ready, but nowadays there is much more structure around it. The cost of these camps is significant and it all adds up. Even a one-week camp is significant, at €200 per child. Children are feeling the brunt of this. Sport contributes to good health and well-being, and for children, that cannot continue to be taken for granted. We need to increase investment in sports. Ireland has been lagging behind our European peers for too long. Our EU peer group invests on average almost three times as much as we do on sport and recreation. We urgently need to see real-time investment in sport and recreational facilities throughout the State. Almost €90 million in funding has been allocated through the large-scale sport infrastructure fund for projects, which is welcome, but barely a fraction of this funding has been drawn down. Because of the rising costs of building, many of these sports facilities will struggle to reach completion. The sporting community needs to see the Government step in and provide increased support where needed. The costs of not investing in sports participation or increasing the levels of physical activity far outweigh the initial costs. Physical inactivity has been estimated to cost the health budget €1.5 billion each year and is responsible for an estimated 14% of all mortality in Ireland. The benefits of sports and recreation do not stop with health and well-being. Research by the Federation of Irish Sport has shown that for every €100 invested in sport by the Government, the Exchequer receives back €195 through taxes on sports-supported expenditures and incomes. We should not look at sports and recreation as a cost but rather as an investment with far-reaching yields. On a separate issue, Debra Ireland, an advocacy group for people living with butterfly skin, or EB, made a presentation last week. Emma Fogarty, who lives with EB, and the parent of someone living with EB made a powerful presentation. It was difficult to hear about the impact the condition has. Their ask for the budget, at less than €1 million, would provide for nursing treatment, outreach treatment and mental health supports. In the context of this huge budget, their ask is very small, yet it would have a significant impact on the quality of their lives. As anybody who is familiar with EB will know, it is very difficult. One girl who just turned 18, Claudia, is an inspiration to young people. She is about to start on a make-up course in college. The condition is devastating, not just for Claudia or Emma but for their entire families and the relationship between husband and wife, yet the State is not willing to intervene and give the resources this family and all the families who have children with EB need to ensure their lives will be made somewhat easier.

That was on 19 July 2004. It was brought into law because the Government at the time acknowledged the failings in supporting our most vulnerable children. Successive Governments have failed to commence the Act fully, meaning a failure of support for our children. This year is no different as we see continued failure in appropriate planning and placement. It is remarkable to have 18 years of failure. We are now at a stage of organising a review of EPSEN. Is there any point at which the Government will issue an apology for this 18 years of failure?	spk_137
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-07-13	dail	33	Post-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_12	"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. Last month, on statements in advance of the European Council meeting, I raised my deep concerns in respect of the recent trip of Ursula von der Leyen to Israel and her praise of the apartheid system that openly operates there. The message the President of the European Commission delivered was clear for all to see. For increased energy co-operation, the EU is willing to see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. Unfortunately, Ireland is complicit in that policy approach. The Minister has stated in the House that Ireland will not break away from the consensus within the European Union.The consensus within the European Union seems to be ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"", so Israel can do what it wants, when it wants and there will be no repercussions. We have often spoken here about Ireland's commitment to Palestine over the years. Irish Aid, along with other EU partners, has worked on so many projects that have had a profound impact on the daily lives of thousands of Palestinians. I have worked in Palestine, in the Gaza Strip. It has always been a source of great pride to me to see various villages around the Gaza Strip with signage showing that various projects have been supported by Irish Aid and by the Irish State. That is why I find it disturbing to see images of what is now happening and what is being allowed to happen in the Masafer Yatta area, to see, the week after Ursula von der Leyen's visit, the Israeli Government announcing plans to demolish more villages such as Khallet ad-Dhabe. These are villages whose infrastructure was supported by Irish Aid and EU humanitarian aid funds. An EU sign in the village reads ""Humanitarian Support to Protect Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem From Forced Transfer"". The apartheid state of Israel has designated a part of Masafer Yatta, including this village, as a firing zone. Approximately 20% of the West Bank has been designated by the Israelis as a firing zone. This is going to have a devastating impact on more than 5,000 Palestinians from 38 different communities. What is the EU doing to protect these Palestinians, many of whom are living in villages supported by Irish and EU aid? We need to see the European Council, Ireland, and the Minister of State himself standing up to Israel and saying it cannot keep destroying the investments that Ireland has put into Palestinian communities. That is what is happening. When will Ireland stand up and say Israel cannot keep carrying out apartheid, cannot keep destroying investments that Ireland has made in Palestine?"	spk_234

I agree with some of the points Deputy Matthews made in relation to An Taisce. The organisation has played a really important role in protecting Irish culture and heritage. It has held people to account who need to be held to account. The organisation has done the State a good service. I wish to acknowledge that. Planning and development is an important issue in every community right across the country. The recent controversy in relation to An Bord Pleanála has been a huge blow to the confidence of the communities that I represent. It has undermined the belief and sense that there is any integrity around An Bord Pleanála. That feeling has been badly damaged. I am not sure if people are aware of the anger that exists among the public following events surrounding An Bord Pleanála. The allegations around Mr. Paul Hyde have done serious damage to the integrity of the entire planning process, and not just An Bord Pleanála. The anger has also spilled out towards Dublin City Council and other local authorities right across the country, even though there is no evidence of any link there. People will always talk, but in my experience as a member of Dublin City Council the planners I worked with were nothing but professional and showed great integrity. We agreed and disagreed on different elements of planning applications and developments, but the reality is that the they always showed complete professionalism. I am aware that the Minister has sanctioned an inquiry into the deputy chairman of An Bord Pleanála. The online publication 	spk_311

Like many others, I spent several years working in the hospitality sector. I understand how poorly paid are those working in the sector, how challenging a job it is and how important tips are to staff right across the hospitality sector. My party and I support the Bill. It is important. There has been a long campaign on this matter. It is great to see it advancing through the various Stages. I commend the constant effort of hospitality staff.From personal experience, I know that when you work in the hospitality sector, you are drained at the end of each day. It is extremely tiring work. The last thing you want to do is get involved in a campaign. The fact that they are committed and working to make changes is a credit to them. It is also a credit to the trade union movement, which has been extremely active during this campaign. As Deputy O'Reilly said, the One Galway movement has also led the way. SIPTU, Mandate and Unite the Union have all campaigned tirelessly on this issue for many years. My colleague, Senator Gavan, has been a constant voice in support of workers in the hospitality sector for a long time. He highlighted the issue of tips being withheld by employers. In 2017 he introduced the National Minimum Wage (Protection of Employee Tips) Bill 2017. Unfortunately, that was blocked by the previous Fine Gael-led Government, which made it the subject of a money message. A high number of workers in the hospitality sector frequently see their hard-earned tips being withheld by employers. We have seen from research that one in three workers do not receive the tips that they earn. The change in stance by Fine Gael is very welcome. I commend the Tánaiste, whose engagement in the process relating to this issue has been very important in resolving it and ensuring that the Bill was brought forward. It is important to acknowledge his contribution. Amid the cost-of-living crisis where so many low- and middle- income workers are struggling from week to week, it is hard to see their tips being withheld and gratuities taken from them by employers. As Deputy O'Reilly said, people want to see staff getting the tips they leave for them. They pay the staff who have been serving them during the night and delivering excellent service, and they want the tips they leave to go to those staff. Ireland has one of the highest rates of low pay in the developed world, with 20% of our workers in low-paid jobs and 50% of women currently earning €20,000 a year or less. A high proportion of those employed in the hospitality sector are low-income workers, and their tips and gratuities can make or break their week. The withholding of tips and wages is especially rampant in the food and drink and hospitality sector, in which large numbers of women and migrant workers are employed. In the context of these sectors, you would expect tips, gratuities and service charges left by customers for workers to end up in workers' pockets. Little do the majority of tipping customers realise the extent of the practice of withholding of tips, gratuities and service charges by employers. Employers pocketing tips and gratuities meant for workers must be treated as what it is, namely, an unfair practice. In many ways, it is about power. It is the power of employers to impose whatever measures they want on staff. It is up to the State and the Government to ensure that this legislation is delivered. We need the penalty for wages withheld by employers to be increased to a class A fine of €5,000 and not the proposed class C fine of €2,500. Over the past ten years, almost €18 million in withheld wages has been returned to workers after investigation by the WRC. While legislation to protect employees’ tips will have a profound impact on workers in the hospitality sector, we must also acknowledge that workers should not be dependent on tips in order to live. Workers need to be paid a living wage. Relying on tips to survive is the result of what has happened in the context of a sector in which low pay, precarious employment and poor working conditions have been normalised. We need to see the hospitality sector engage with trade unions and work to re-establish the joint labour committee. Many of the recruitment and staffing issues the hospitality sector faces could be resolved by an effective joint labour committee. Without a system involving tiered rates of pay, overtime rates, Sunday premiums, holiday entitlements and sick pay, the sector will continue to face many of the same issues it faces at present.	spk_329

It is so important because it speaks to who we are as a society. Groups such as Involve Autism, which is represented in the Gallery, do such powerful work in advocacy but also in supporting families in communities who are struggling day in, day out. There is also Neurodiversity Irishtown, Ringsend and Pearse Street, which does amazing work for families that it should not have to do. We all want to see classes opened as a matter of urgency. Just as a school should not be opened without a wheelchair ramp, a school should not be opened without an autism class. Schools must be compelled to open special education classes and, equally, they must be given resources to ensure that when they are open, they will have the necessary speech therapy and a sensory room. They have to have the wrap-around services because opening a class with just four walls might as well be in a field, and that is not acceptable. We need to ensure the services are there for the children. Neurodiverse children deserve a high quality education in their community and they should not have to be taxied out of their homes, past their schools and far from where they live. As I have said previously, more than €70,000 per day is spent on taxiing children out of their homes past their local schools in south Dublin alone. That €70,000 could easily be used to resource schools that are opening classes. It is essential that happens because it amounts to a significant waste of money and it is unfair on the families and children who are taxied out.Last week I mentioned a child aged two-and-a-half years who is being taxied out of their class because no early intervention is available in the community. Our children deserve a decent education. It is good for the community and for everybody in society.	spk_31

It is always a great event. It is very positive. It makes people feel good and feel happy. There is a real sense of solidarity on the march. Pride month has many great events. Last week I was at one, the Pride dog show, in the Cabbage Garden off Kevin Street. It was a fantastic event and everybody enjoyed it. It was very positive. All of this positivity contrasts with the homophobic attacks carried out recently. It makes those attacks even more shocking and more upsetting. It is very important that those who carry out these crimes face the full force of the law. There can be no place for this type of behaviour whereby somebody can feel threatened or unsafe because of their sexuality. We have to, as we are doing today, give voice to the LGBTQI+ community. Last week I was here when the portrait of Senator Norris was hung. I have to say it was a lovely event. It is important to acknowledge the contribution Senator Norris has made for more than 30 years. He was first elected to the Seanad in 1987. He flew the flag. He was openly gay at a time that was much different to now. He deserves huge credit. He walked the walk and flew the flag. He did so much for his community and for wider society. He made it a human rights issue and a social justice issue. He fought the fight and is still fighting it. It was lovely to see him. He was in great form. There are many people like him, such as Kieran Rose who headed up GLEN for many years, who have been huge advocates for the LGBTQI community. It is important to acknowledge and remember the contribution and actions they carried out. Ireland was a bleak place for anybody who was gay at the time. It is still challenging and difficult but it was a significantly darker place. It is important to acknowledge, remember and name those who carried the flag. Many people have been named here. Leinster Rugby's Nick McCarthy came out recently. This is very positive for a number of reasons. He has been well supported in the rugby community and the wider community. It is a credit to Leinster Rugby that he has got this support. It is very important. It is significant that an elite male sportsperson has come out. Elite male sports are a cold house in many ways for any diversity, particularly for the LGBTI community. We see the Premier League in England and we do not have to look too far from home in the League of Ireland. Very few male elite athletes come out and state they are gay. Nick McCarthy coming out is very welcome. There is no openly gay football player in the Premier League. The last footballer who came out was Justin Fashanu back in the 1990s. I do not know whether the Minister remembers him. I remember him as I am around that long. When he came out, the abuse he got was horrendous. At the time I remember thinking it would be a watershed moment but it was not. Even today we do not have any Premier League player, and very few elite sportspeople, who have come out as gay. This is an issue that we need to be aware of. The national governing bodies, NGBs, must be aware of it and do more to support players coming out.	spk_240

If anything, things seem to be getting worse. People living in flat complexes in the inner city are genuinely frustrated in respect of having been forgotten. They feel, and the evidence suggests they are right, that Dublin City Council has neglected them for too long, as has the Government. They are living in conditions that are just not acceptable. These are not all old flat complexes. Many of the newer flat complexes have serious issues as well. Not too far from here, in York Street, is a flat complex that is only 12 years old. Around Christmas time, the residents of an entire block had to be moved out because of a water leak that occurred due to inadequate maintenance. They had to leave that flat complex during Covid-19 and it was traumatic for them. Therefore, there appear to be serious maintenance issues in all the flat complexes across the city. There certainly are in those premises in Dublin Bay South. The Glovers Court complex is at the other end of the old York Street. An email was recently sent to all the councillors and Deputies in Dublin Bay South. I will refer to it because it expresses how the people living there feel and how the vast majority of people living in flat complexes feel. The email states that the tenants in Glovers Court are tired of the broken promises and regeneration promises that have been made to them for a number of years and are tired of being told it is in progress and the application has been submitted. The email goes on to state that this is not good enough and that the tenants in Glovers Court want to know what local Deputies and councillors are doing for them, other than emailing the council, which then makes promises to the tenants that are broken. The email continues by stating that the residents are tired of carrying their children over human faeces and urine every day; tired of having to constantly to pay €40 to €60 a week for gas to keep their flats warm; tired of constantly bleaching their walls to get rid of the damp and mould; tired of carrying heavy bottles of water up the stairs because they cannot drink their water because it is contaminated; tired of bringing their children to doctors and hospitals because they are constantly sick because it is colder inside the flats than outside; tired of being woken up at night by the antisocial behaviour in the complex; and tired of being woken by fire sirens because someone has set fire to a flat. The email further continues by stating that a couple of weeks ago there was a fire in the complex and Dublin Fire Brigade could not access it because people were parked there like it was a free-for-all. 	spk_260

I met residents from Andrews Court four years ago in respect of a proposal from Dublin City Council. It will be another four years before a small block housing 11 families will be dealt with. None of the flat complexes on Digges Street, Cuffe Street and Mercer House have playgrounds for toddlers or children to play in and entertain themselves. These are not big asks. It is not unreasonable for families to expect their children to have somewhere to play when living in a flat complex. There is nothing. Resources are not being put into the flat complexes. If Dublin City Council is not going to invest adequately in the maintenance of flat complexes in order to deal with the issues facing residents, the residents will become demoralised and places will become dilapidated. As I have said, many complexes are in serious need of regeneration. I welcome anybody in the House to come and visit some flats. Some are next to derelict and it is demoralising for residents and public representatives, across parties, to have to meet residents and hear their stories.

Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-06-22	dail	33	Respite Care Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I welcome the motion brought forward by the Independent Group. It is a very important issue. Many of us know the key role that respite provides in supporting family carers and those with a disability. More than 500,000 family carers provide vital care and support for their loved ones. I will raise one issue, in particular, that was raised with me by a family. They are really struggling to get carers. One member of the family requires a lot of care and carers are constantly not showing up. They cannot fulfil those hours and the family is left stranded. The person needs two carers at a time and if only one shows up it makes it very difficult. This is very challenging for them as a family. The individual who contacted me said that if carers are non-EU citizens they are entitled to work 20 hours per week. This should be increased to 40 hours per week in line with non-EU workers who work directly for the HSE and in private nursing homes. This would increase the number of carers available to carry out essential work. I am aware that such a proposal crosses over with the Department of Justice and that it is a complex issue.What this person is finding out, as are many families across the State, is that the HSE and care homes are sucking away carers from visiting homes. That is having a negative impact on families, who are at their wits' end. They need this support but unfortunately they are not getting it. If adjustments were made and there was a level playing field for all people working in the care sector, that would help ensure carers, like the ones in this family, are not let down day after day.	spk_31

It has to be made clear at the next European Council meeting that one cannot replace dependency on one rogue state with dependency on another rogue state, the other rogue state being apartheid Israel. The Government is opposed to using gas from Russia because Russia annexes and occupies Ukrainian territory, but it wants us to replace it with gas from Israel, which annexes and occupies Palestinian territory. Where is the consistency in this? Again, Israel is getting a free hit. During her recent trip to Israel, Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU and Israel are bound to be friends and allies. Israel is a state that operates a cruel system of apartheid that is completely at odds with the values of the European Union. Israel should not be welcomed as a friend and ally. We must ensure that the EU stands up for freedom and justice and does not cosy up to apartheid states such as Israel. Ireland must lead the way on this. It must let its voice be heard. It must lean forward and take a risk. This gas comes from an apartheid, terror state that steals Palestinian land and executes journalists, women and children with impunity. That seems to be okay for this Irish Government. It will condemn, but there will be no consequences. To follow up on the comments of my colleague, Deputy Mairéad Farrell, the British Government's decision to extradite Mr. Julian Assange to America to face the rest of his life in prison is disgraceful. Julian Assange is being extradited to the US not because he committed a crime, but because he exposed a crime. Nobody should be imprisoned for shining a light into dark corners. Julian Assange should be freed, not thrown to the wolves, which is what is happening now. The Helms-Burton Act introduced by the United States has been causing hardship for Cubans for decades. It has had a crippling effect on how Ireland and the EU support trade and solidarity with Cuba. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has spoken out on the Irish position on the US embargo of Cuba. He said: ""[Fundamentally,] Ireland believes that the [US] embargo [on Cuba] serves no constructive purpose and that its lifting would facilitate an opening of Cuba's economy, to the benefit of its people."" These are important words, and I commend the Minister on calling it out as it is. However, we have to see continued pressure from the EU and the US to bring an easing and eventual end of this brutal embargo. I commend the members of the Cuba Solidarity Forum Ireland, who have been securing medical supplies and personally transporting them to hospitals in Cuba. In recent weeks, I read how the children's transplant waiting lists in Cuba were growing longer due to the Helms-Burton Act. The tactic of the US is one of the most cruel and inhumane possible. We must see an end to the blocking of sales of medical supplies from Ireland and EU member states to Cuba."	spk_162
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-06-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs: Statements	dbsect_31	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue. Parents of neurotypical children have an expectation that their children will get a decent education. It is not an unreasonable expectation. However, it is not an expectation that parents of neurodiverse children have. One parent from the Neurodiversity - Irishtown, Ringsend and Pearse Street and Involve Autism advocacy groups told me recently that as a parent of an autistic child, getting a place in a school is a horrific struggle. Parents feel they are begging the teachers, principals and SENOs for a place. They have to pretend their children are not as autistic as they actually are in order that they have a chance of getting the school to accept their child. SENOs will not pick up the phone to parents because there is nothing they can say to them. In my view, the NCSE is dysfunctional. There has to be a way that the NCSE can gather the information it needs to ensure the resources are directed where they are needed. Currently, the NCSE does not have the information it needs, so it cannot plan. That is a major factor in this human disaster. Every child should have an appropriate place in its community with the wraparound services it needs and deserves. We have to stop the practice of taxiing children out of their community. I have raised the issue previously. The Government is spending over €70,000 a day taxiing children with disabilities out of their community to schools a long distance away. This practice cannot be allowed to continue. I understand that a child as young as two and half is being taxied out of their community because there are not enough early intervention classes in the area. The Government has failed to plan and failed to act. As a result, it has failed our children.	spk_266

It is not an ideal way to process legislation but it is important that we are dealing with it as the alternative would be chaos. Sinn Féin supports the Bill. We have tabled an amendment to ensure that Garda court presenters are not below the rank of sergeant. This allows prosecuting gardaí to focus on serious crime in higher courts. Gardaí need to be utilised in an efficient and effective way. They play such an important role in communities across the country and the last thing we need is gardaí tied up in court when they could be utilised more effectively. The same applies when gardaí are tied up, as mentioned previously, doing desk duties and endless paperwork when they could be out doing the jobs they are particularly good at. The amount of paperwork gardaí have to do is madness. The amount of time a simple statement takes makes no sense in an era of technology. Gardaí need to be working with communities and they need to be resourced to do so. A concrete example of the lack of Garda resources in the south inner city is that Pearse Street Garda station does not have a minibus to work with community groups. Pearse Street Garda station is one of the busiest stations in the country, yet it does not have a minibus. This means the engagement between gardaí and the local community is limited. The work community gardaí do is crucial when it comes to dealing with young people and keeping them engaged in society in a positive way. In many ways, as I have mentioned in the House previously, the Mulvey report has divided the city. It has divided the north inner city community from the south inner city community. They are effectively one community but the Mulvey report has divided it to a point where the north inner city has significant resources to work with communities. On the southside, however, Pearse Street Garda station does not have a minibus to work with local communities. That is a reflection of the lack of the required resources in the inner city. I have said previously that the findings of the Mulvey report should be mirrored on the south inner city.Again, this is an important Bill and we support it, with an amendment.	spk_258

When we see them at a wide range of sporting events, including GAA, soccer and rugby games in the RDS and at various community events, it is important to remember that the organisation gets funding from the State, albeit indirectly through the national governing bodies. However, the dark and deeply disturbing actions of some of its personnel during the 1990s seldom gets the coverage it should. One journalist, Mr. Jack Power, has done a great deal of strong work in bringing this particular issue to the fore. The child and adult sexual abuse carried out over a number of years by senior members of St. John Ambulance Ireland is deeply disturbing. I commend the bravery of three survivors, Mr. Mick Finnegan, Mr. Paul Mulholland and Mr. Martin Hoey, who have spoken out publicly of the horrific sexual abuse they experienced when they were members of the organisation. Mr. Finnegan was only a young cadet when the abuse started. Some of his testimony is harrowing. It is distressing. Previously, in this Chamber I have raised my deep concern that the organisation is closing ranks to protect rapists and sexual abusers who may or may not still be active members of St. John Ambulance Ireland. Now, once again, I am here raising my deeply-held concerns that St. John Ambulance Ireland is, once again, closing ranks. Survivors of that horrific abuse are deeply concerned that the review by Dr. Shannon will not be made public and will not be shared with survivors. If this is the case, it would be an absolute disgrace. It would be an insult to the bravery of the people and survivors who have come forward with their horrific abuse stories. It will be highlighted in Dr. Shannon's report and his review. It is not easy for survivors to come forward and to have to give a detailed account of the horrors of sexual abuse. It takes great bravery and commitment and a sense of justice to step forward. I ask the Minister directly to liaise with Dr. Shannon and with St. John Ambulance Ireland to ensure that the review is made available to the public, and particularly to the survivors of this sexual abuse. We need to see organisations such as St. John Ambulance Ireland using the review as a learning tool to ensure best practice when it comes to child protection. I certainly commend the Minister for the work he has done for and the support he has provided to survivors. It does not sit well with me to know that State funds, via national governing bodies, NGBs, of sporting organisations, are ending up in an organisation that has closed ranks in the face of a review into sex abuse and now, possibly, will prevent the publication of this report. Week in, week out St. John Ambulance Ireland continues to provide a service for various sporting and national governing bodies and communities. We need to see the Government standing firm and ensuring that St. John Ambulance Ireland is not allowed to hide anything here.	spk_310

Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-06-02	dail	33	Urban Regeneration Report: Motion	dbsect_42	I thank and commend the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for its work on this report. Regeneration is particularly important in the south inner city, in particular the constituency of Dublin Bay South. When we talk about regeneration and derelict sites, we have to consider that Dublin City Council has residents living in overcrowded conditions every day on what can only be described as derelict sites. The Government has given approval to stage 1 of the project relating to Pearse House. Pearse House will undergo redevelopment and regeneration. I was on Ross Road recently, not too far from here. I saw a plaque on the wall relating to a development that occurred around 2000. It was a quote that came from community consultation and stated that the renovation was completed in September 2000. If a place is not maintained, however, it will fall into disrepair, and over time, the people living there will become demoralised and the place will go back to the way it was before. That was on the wall of a regenerated development on Ross Road. It is ironic that it was erected by Dublin City Council, because it seems it does not listen to its own advice. People are demoralised. Some are even broken. They are furious and they will not take this anymore. Expecting people to live in Pearse House, Canon Mooney Gardens or Leo Fitzgerald House is completely unacceptable. They are modern day tenements. People talk about the architecture of the buildings designed by Herbert Simms. There is no doubt that they are beautiful buildings, but they are not suitable for the families living in them. Certain individuals are more concerned about the architecture than other people's living conditions. Dublin City Council has neglected inner-city communities for too long. They will not take it anymore. When one walks around Rathmines, Pearse House, Mercer House and other flat complexes, one sees the neglect.There are shocking conditions internally and externally. There is wiring, damp and rats. Illegal dumping is allowed to go unchallenged and unchecked. No families should be allowed to live in conditions Dublin City Council is overseeing. I was in Markievicz House, not too far from here, in the centre of Dublin city meeting residents with my colleague, Councillor Daniel Céitinn. One resident told us how faeces and urine were coming up through her sink so she had to go out and unblock the drain. As a result of her unblocking the drain it did not come up into her flat but it came out onto the public area. Urine and faeces were literally running along the footpath 20 ft. from a playground. It is absolutely mad that Dublin City Council and the Government are not showing any sense of urgency around the regeneration of flat complexes. Canon Mooney Gardens in Ringsend was due for regeneration ten years ago but the Government and council ran out of money and it was dropped from the list for regeneration. Now they cannot get the regeneration and redevelopment they desperately need. They are just being fobbed off day in, day out with crumbs from the table, a flowerpot here and there, as if that is going to make any difference to the quality of their lives. It is completely mad. I was in a meeting with Dublin City Council and residents from St. Andrew's Court about four years ago. A design team has been appointed but it has not met with residents yet. I accept we have gone through Covid but the pace of redevelopment of St. Andrew's Court is glacial. Pearse House is supposed to be going through redevelopment. If I go down there and tell residents about the regeneration, half of them will not believe me and half will be extremely sceptical. They just do not believe it is going to happen. There is no real communication. Dublin City Council estate managers work with what they have and do a good job in what they have to work with. There is not enough resources being put in to communicate with residents, explaining the process and how they are going to see their community transformed. Residents in Pearse House and right across the inner city cannot be allowed live in these conditions any more. It just cannot be acceptable in 2022 to allow families be reared in overcrowded, dirty, unsafe conditions.	spk_331
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-06-01	dail	33	Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	I acknowledge the motion and congratulate the Regional Group. These grants have a huge impact on the quality of life of many older people and individuals with disabilities. These grants are important in keeping people at home. It gives them a chance to live independently and it also keeps the pressure off the hospitals. It is a win-win for everybody. We only have to imagine what the hospitals would be like if it was not for this grant. The number of people over the age of 65 is expected to reach 1.4 million by 2040, which will work out at approximately 23% of the population, whereas over-65s are currently 13.5% to 14% of the population. Therefore, these grants are going to be increasingly important for individuals but also for families and, again, to keep the pressure off the hospitals. For many who contact me the process is challenging. Supports are needed for people who are struggling to make an application. In the current environment, costs are flying up and surpassing the grant, and individuals who apply cannot afford to do the work when they go to get it done. Funding is a huge issue. As was said previously, this is a very good scheme and it does not need to be overhauled, but it certainly needs to be funded and resourced, and supports need to be put in place for people who are struggling with the application process. If an older person gets a grant and they then have to carry out particular work, the quoted cost is often outdated by the time the work starts. Delays are significant and that is often because, when someone applies, it comes back to needing more support and resources within the local authorities to process the applications. If someone applies and makes a mistake, as with the passports, they go back to the start of the queue whereas somebody in Dublin City Council should contact them to say they have left out A, B or C and they need to correct that. However, as it stands, the process can take months. The person will contact me or other Deputies, and we then contact the council, which says the person has not filled in the form properly, and it is then updated. That should not happen. The councils need to be more proactive and structures need to be put in place to ensure there are not such delays.	spk_23

It is horrific for people planning to go away. There is no clarity. It is an absolute shambles. The Minister of State himself would know that. It must be embarrassing to be working in the Department of Transport and to have to try to justify what is happening, because there is no justification. I welcome this opportunity to speak on the issue of transport in Dublin Bay South. The communities in Ringsend, Irishtown and Sandymount are facing a nightmare due to the lack of public transport. There will be 3,500 new homes built on the Irish Glass Bottle site and there is no prospect of a Luas, which was part of the planning application and the strategic development zone, SDZ. Residents in the new houses are being held hostage. We have a cycle lane but I think I am the only one who uses it. Some 3,500 new homes are being built on this site and the Luas has been kicked down the road for another ten or 15 years. Seán Moore Road is already a car park. Residents cannot move in or out during peak hours. The Government has now decided not to put a Luas there even though that was an important part of granting planning permission for the glass bottle site. Residents feel let down by the Government. They feel it is a game of smoke and mirrors. They were told they would get a Luas, new bridges, public transport and infrastructure. The preparatory work is taking place for the homes on the glass bottle site and yet none of that infrastructure is being planned. Residents in Ringsend, Irishtown and Sandymount are being let down by this Government. 	spk_146

They do not merely accept the narrative put out in a military or government press release but seek the truth at source to broadcast to the world. In Nicaragua and El Salvador in the 1980s, journalists helped to expose the worst crimes of government death squads. There are countless examples from Vietnam, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan and now Ukraine where brave committed and outspoken journalists have exposed the brutality of war at great personal risk. These are journalists such as Pierre Zakrzewski, a talented warzone photographer who reported on conflicts from Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Ukraine. He was brutally murdered by Russian shelling not far from the capital of Ukraine. Two weeks ago, Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was executed by the Israeli occupation forces. Her assassination was clear and deliberate. It is getting more and more frustrating that almost weekly we hear members of various political parties expressing their condemnation of Israeli terror and land grabs. We have condemnation after condemnation but no consequences. This is a huge issue. It is a flaw in the Government's policy. There are never consequences for Israeli crimes. If the Minister were walking down Kildare Street and saw an individual being beaten to death, he would intervene and there would be consequences for the person carrying out that brutal assault. An international equivalent of this is that Israel is beating Palestine to death. It is robbing its land. It is stealing the land and the Minister knows this. He has seen it first-hand.	spk_97

There are no consequences because the Government is not willing to stand up to Europe and the Israelis and face them down and state we will pass the occupied territories Bill. There have to be consequences for Israeli terror. This is not what the Government is about. The Government is about appeasing Israel. This is something we have to address. When will the Government go beyond condemnation and ensure there are consequences for Israel? Will it outline what consequences there are for Israel for executing people, stealing land and arresting people and detaining them on administrative detention? Will the Minister tell me what the consequences are? I can see none.	spk_101
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-05-24	dail	33	Refugee Resettlement Programme	dbsect_24	Built in 1893, the Royal City of Dublin Hospital on Upper Baggot Street, more commonly known as Baggot Street hospital, was a main centre of care for a large part of the south-inner city for almost 100 years before the acute services were transferred to St. James's Hospital in 1986. Despite its current state of disrepair, this building stretching 5,600 sq. m is still stunning to look at. It is an excellent example of Victorian architecture in the city. Its striking red-brick facade and high spires make it the most striking landmark in that particular area. The architecture is Flemish, as is that of several of the surrounding buildings, and the old nurses' residence is now the Dylan Hotel around the corner on Eastmoreland Place. For a time, a number of community services were operated out of the hospital, including a primary care team, a stroke team, addiction services and a gay men's health service, but this has all ceased and the building is now rapidly falling into dereliction in one of the most prime sites in Dublin's south-inner city. Incredibly, Baggot Street hospital has been allowed to remain idle for years and local businesses and residents are now calling for it to be used to house people fleeing the war in eastern Europe. This building could have been repurposed ten to 15 years ago to house Dublin's homeless and maybe that is something that will happen in the future. A local developer has said that her building company is happy to provide the labour for this project free of charge. It is estimated to cost €1 million and the labour would be free. That would be a significant saving to the State. That would repair and make fit for purpose the building for Ukrainian refugees. It is estimated the building could comfortably house 200 beds. The developer believes the ground and first floors could be delivered within two months of each other with each subsequent floor taking a month after that to deliver. Works would be done under the supervision of a fire consultant. In recent years, the HSE has indicated it plans to sell part of the hospital for it to be converted into offices, a hotel or apartments and use the funds for a new primary care centre but nothing has ever happened. Today, the building continues to become more and more derelict. I understand the local community is fully behind the project to make it a refugee centre and is willing to do whatever it can to get the hospital ready to welcome Ukrainian refugees.It is in the city centre, where there are many employment opportunities. It has schools and is a perfect location to house Ukrainian refugees. I am asking the Minister of State to intervene as a matter of urgency and get the HSE to show some vision in getting this hospital back into operation as a centre for Ukrainian refugees. With a bit of goodwill on all sides and with the support of the local community, this could be done in a relatively short period. There is much local community support for this initiative and it is a shame that the HSE seems to be totally uninterested in furthering the project. To be brutally honest, the HSE is being negligent and must be reined in. The hospital must be taken from its dead man's grip.	spk_267
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-05-24	dail	33	Refugee Resettlement Programme	dbsect_24	The Government did not need a report to tell us the building is uninhabitable because a cursory look confirms it is not fit for anybody to live in. There is a development company that is willing to give labour for free and make it habitable. It wants to work with fire safety people to ensure it is habitable and safe. It could be used on an emergency basis and it is not a long-term solution for anybody for accommodation purposes. This is certainly an emergency and the Government must act accordingly. I guessed that the Minister of State would say it is on the list. I also know the Government has no intention of taking on or fighting the HSE to get this from its grip. The gatekeepers in the HSE are determined to hold on to it. Baggot Street hospital is a monument to the failure of the Government's housing policy. It is a monument to the failure to address the homelessness crisis. It could have been opened ten or 15 years ago and housed Dublin's homeless population. Why did that not happen? The gatekeepers in the HSE and the Government were not willing to invest in it. As a result, it has been allowed to lie idle. It could have been developed to benefit the local community but that has not happened. If it had been developed years ago, we would not be in this crisis.

Israel knew that the eyes of the world were on it. Yet, it still executed Shireen. The Government has condemned this act, but what is the point of condemnation without consequences? It is because of the reluctance of the Government and the EU to impose consequences on Israel for its terror, that the latter carries out acts like the execution of a journalist. The reality is that the Government is complicit in the murder of Shireen. That is because Ireland stands and watches.

Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-05-12	dail	33	Disability Services	dbsect_32	Last week, news broke that the next round of training for the Garda armed support unit, ASU, had been cancelled. I raised the matter in the House during questions on promised legislation. The competition to fill places on this course was completed back in 2019.Those selected gardaí have been waiting since 2019 to take part in this armed support unit training. These gardaí effectively have had to put elements of their personal lives on hold while they wait on standby for their start date. It now appears that with a click of the fingers, this training course is gone and they have waited in vain. Garda headquarters said claims that the 2019 competition has been halted are incorrect. However, Garda membership say the message has been delivered clearly to them that it has been cancelled. There were widespread media reports last week that the armed support unit across Dublin had barely enough resources to be operational and is only at 75% capacity. Last year alone, there were more than 2,500 weapons and explosive offences across the State. Ireland has a high rate of gun violence. Our gun murder rate is six times that of Britain and one of the highest across the EU. Of course, it is not only firearms incidents to which the armed support unit responds. It is called upon daily to deal with the growing use of knives by gangs. Over a four-year period, the number of knife seizures in Dublin across most divisions has doubled. Local residents in City Quay have raised the issue before. They are still living in dread. I acknowledge that the Garda has put in place a plan to tackle the random street violence and use of knives in City Quay and in the Creighton Street and Pearse Street areas. That has been very welcome and has made a difference. Residents still live in dread, however. Young people are hiding weapons and knives in the bushes of Elizabeth O'Farrell Park in City Quay. It is still a community in fear. It is really important that the armed support unit is resourced properly. The increasing use of weapons such as guns and knives is a cause for concern, not just for working-class communities but also the rank-and-file gardaí who patrol the streets. When a 999 call comes in regarding a possible knife or gun crime, it is the armed support unit that gardaí turn to for backup. How does it instil confidence in the public when we hear reports of gardaí having to wait up to three hours for support? The feud that has already claimed one life in Finglas is at boiling point. Gangland tension is rising across Dublin and spilling over into different parts of the city, including my own constituency of Dublin Bay South. Recently in Digges Street, shots were fired through a window at a family who were all at home. It was a case of mistaken identity. The perpetrators thought it was a different flat. That family is terrified; they are afraid go back home now. Will the Minister of State comment on the current status of the next round of training for the Dublin region armed support unit? I understand the Government may be of the view that this an internal matter for An Garda Síochána and that it is independent in its allocation of resources. Naturally, it always says that but things have got so bad that it is very important the Government intervenes to ensure resources are in place to allow the armed support unit to make sure our communities right across the inner city are safe.

I did anticipate that he was going to say it was an operational matter and, of course, nobody expects the Government to get involved in the day-today running. When there is an armed support unit, however, which is vital to the safety of communities throughout the country, and no more so than in Dublin Bay South in the inner city where, like I said, there is serious violence using knives and where guns are being shot, Government must intervene, not in how its personnel are trained or where they are deployed but to ensure it has enough resources. If it does not have enough resources, the gardaí cannot do their jobs properly and protect the communities they have been requested to protect. The competition process for the Dublin region of the armed support unit was launched in 2019 and, of course, it was impacted by the pandemic. However, the reason for launching that competition has not changed and probably has become more acute and worsened. It was launched in 2019 due to the low numbers in the armed support unit and, three years on, approximately ten gardaí have left the unit recently due to transfers and promotions. With a fresh round of promotions to the rank of sergeant issued last Friday, it is safe to say the number of departures will grow. In effect, the combined resources will probably be down approximately 75% to 80% of what they should be. That is not acceptable. Communities are being left exposed. I accept the Government cannot intervene in day-to-day procedures but it must intervene to ensure the Garda armed support unit and individual gardaí are resourced properly in order that they can protect communities like those in City Quay and Pearse Street that have been left high and dry. They have been left to try to look after themselves, and that will not suit anyone.	spk_471
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-05-12	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_33	Last week, news broke that the next round of training for the Garda armed support unit, ASU, had been cancelled. I raised the matter in the House during questions on promised legislation. The competition to fill places on this course was completed back in 2019.Those selected gardaí have been waiting since 2019 to take part in this armed support unit training. These gardaí effectively have had to put elements of their personal lives on hold while they wait on standby for their start date. It now appears that with a click of the fingers, this training course is gone and they have waited in vain. Garda headquarters said claims that the 2019 competition has been halted are incorrect. However, Garda membership say the message has been delivered clearly to them that it has been cancelled. There were widespread media reports last week that the armed support unit across Dublin had barely enough resources to be operational and is only at 75% capacity. Last year alone, there were more than 2,500 weapons and explosive offences across the State. Ireland has a high rate of gun violence. Our gun murder rate is six times that of Britain and one of the highest across the EU. Of course, it is not only firearms incidents to which the armed support unit responds. It is called upon daily to deal with the growing use of knives by gangs. Over a four-year period, the number of knife seizures in Dublin across most divisions has doubled. Local residents in City Quay have raised the issue before. They are still living in dread. I acknowledge that the Garda has put in place a plan to tackle the random street violence and use of knives in City Quay and in the Creighton Street and Pearse Street areas. That has been very welcome and has made a difference. Residents still live in dread, however. Young people are hiding weapons and knives in the bushes of Elizabeth O'Farrell Park in City Quay. It is still a community in fear. It is really important that the armed support unit is resourced properly. The increasing use of weapons such as guns and knives is a cause for concern, not just for working-class communities but also the rank-and-file gardaí who patrol the streets. When a 999 call comes in regarding a possible knife or gun crime, it is the armed support unit that gardaí turn to for backup. How does it instil confidence in the public when we hear reports of gardaí having to wait up to three hours for support? The feud that has already claimed one life in Finglas is at boiling point. Gangland tension is rising across Dublin and spilling over into different parts of the city, including my own constituency of Dublin Bay South. Recently in Digges Street, shots were fired through a window at a family who were all at home. It was a case of mistaken identity. The perpetrators thought it was a different flat. That family is terrified; they are afraid go back home now. Will the Minister of State comment on the current status of the next round of training for the Dublin region armed support unit? I understand the Government may be of the view that this an internal matter for An Garda Síochána and that it is independent in its allocation of resources. Naturally, it always says that but things have got so bad that it is very important the Government intervenes to ensure resources are in place to allow the armed support unit to make sure our communities right across the inner city are safe. Currently, that feeling is not there. The Garda and armed support unit need to be resourced properly.	spk_469

Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-05-10	dail	33	Europe Day: Statements	dbsect_14	"Yesterday marked 70 years since the Schuman Declaration. It was a time when states were struggling to rebuild after the brutal destruction of the Second World War. With the horrors of that war still fresh in the minds of so many, the core of the declaration presented a strong determination to prevent another war. It aimed to ""make war between the historic rivals [...] 'not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible'"". This declaration set in place a vision for a new Europe, one with co-operation at its core. When we look at the aims and values of the EU today, we can see the potential of this community. It is important to acknowledge and commend the great social advances made across the EU member states in the last 70 years. I am, however, concerned that the EU has drifted dangerously far from its values and aims. The EU's aims in the wider world are clearly defined. These include contributing ""to peace, security, the sustainable development of the Earth [...] strict observance of [...] international law"" and to ""solidarity and mutual respect among peoples, free and fair trade, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights [...]"", which, of course, sounds great. The reality of the actions of the EU and its member states paints a different picture. The military-industrial complex in the EU has silently developed into one of the largest in the world, where making profits by EU states has clearly taken precedence over the aims of the EU worldwide. EU policy on arms trade clearly states that ""Member States are determined to prevent the export of military technology and equipment which might be used for internal repression or international aggression or contribute to regional instability"". It has been clearly documented, however, that arms and military equipment produced in Europe and sold outside the EU have been used in brutal war crimes and caused forced displacement and migration. We only have to look at Saudi Arabia and Israel as prime examples. The Saudi Arabian Government is one of the biggest clients for European arms, with the EU arms purchased frequently ending up in war-torn regions. While MEPs voted for an EU-wide arms embargo against Saudi Arabia because of its horrific crimes in Yemen, it was disappointing that the vote did not compel EU member states to act. It was merely symbolic. This symbolic act made little or no difference to the thousands of Yemeni men, women and children killed or maimed by weapons supplied by EU member state governments. I have raised the subject of the crimes of apartheid Israel here on many occasions. What many of us might not realise, though, are the massive amounts of money being made by EU states when arming Israel. Between 2015 and 2020, Germany exported more than €1 billion worth of arms to Israel. Despite countless international human rights groups documenting Israeli war crimes and acts of apartheid, the EU stayed silent while EU member states made large profits selling weapons to these rogue states. We urgently need the EU to be pulled back onto the track of its original aims and values, namely, peace, justice and the protection of human rights."	spk_225
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-05-05	dail	33	Accommodation Needs of Those Fleeing Ukraine: Statements	dbsect_31	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. Unfortunately since the previous occasion I spoke on this matter the situation in Ukraine has become even worse. The human cost of the war continues to grow as cities are razed, towns are steamrolled and villages are laid to rest. Nowhere appears to be out of reach of Russian brutality. Even cities in the far west of Ukraine such as Lviv are targeted. Sadly we have often seen the brutal use of missiles in recent years by so-called great powers and superpowers. As ever, civilians the world over continue to pay the price for the wars of the elite. It is ordinary men, women and children in the firing line. Whether it is residential neighbourhoods in Mariupol, children playing in Gaza, weddings or field hospitals in Afghanistan or starving villages in Yemen or Somalia modern remote warfare always hurts innocent civilians the most. While some states try to normalise this brutal form of war it is the responsibility of neutral states such as Ireland to call it out. It is also our responsibility to lead against the war and against the institutions that facilitate it. The efforts of Ireland's diplomatic mission at the United Nations and the leadership it has shown have not gone unnoticed. However, I believe our political leadership can and should go further. The United Nations and not NATO is the proper forum for delivering aid to Ukraine if sought and, if sought, a peacekeeping mission. Ireland can and should be more vocal on this point. We should be acting as leaders for a non-aligned policy of peacekeeping at the Security Council. We must challenge the veto of imperialist powers, whether that is Russia or any other great power, and ensure human rights, peace and solidarity are the defining virtues of UN decision making. We must use our position to show leadership among the non-aligned nations of the world and advocate a new democratic model of UN decision making. While imperialist powers continue to hold a veto against UN peacekeeping deployments they will continue in their war of aggression the world over. As has been mentioned, it is important that we accept those fleeing Russian terror. The generosity of the public needs to be reflected by the Government. We have the resources to house all and it is important that we do not divide society. Earlier, Deputy Ó Broin made suggestions that are worth taking on board. I acknowledge the work the Irish Refugee Council and local authorities have done on managing the reception of Ukrainian refugees. Dublin City Council has been very supportive of the community that is welcoming residents at the Evergreen Club in Terenure. I acknowledge the work and commitment of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. He and his staff have been hugely professional, supportive and encouraging. Along with all of his staff they have made a huge difference. I welcome the commitment by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, to ensure the current targets are not impacted by Ukrainian refugees. This would only set vulnerable groups against each other and could damage social cohesion and social solidarity and give the extremists an opportunity to develop their hate. As do other Deputies, I believe the Baggot Street hospital provides an opportunity to develop support and it is important that it is done.	spk_321

The latest report from the RTB paints in black and white the devastating impact this Government's housing policies have had on renters, with the average new monthly rent in Dublin standing at €1,972. Rent in Dublin has increased by 100% since 2011. It is safe to say that in my constituency of Dublin Bay South, the average monthly rent is more than €2,000. Today, I saw a three-bedroom apartment in Capital Dock advertised for €5,000 a month. That is what they are looking for. That is complete madness. It is unaffordable for the vast majority of working families. In Capital Dock, those involved let some of the units lie idle rather than reduce the rent. There does not seem to be any sign of a break for renters on the horizon. While we see large numbers of developments being built and designated as build-to-rent, the pricing of rent for one of these units is completely out of the reach of average working families. Some 3,500 new homes are due to be built on the glass bottle site but there is no good news for those on average wages because the cost of the new homes there will be between €500,000 and €600,000. The Minister mentioned social and affordable houses. It is unclear whether there will be any social and affordable housing on the glass bottle site. He might indicate whether that will happen. Residents there are very concerned that there will be no social and affordable housing on the glass bottle site. That matter needs to be addressed. The residents need to be reassured. The cost of those homes, at €500,000 or €600,000 each, will make renting in their own community unaffordable for the vast majority of young families, even for those with good or average incomes. I know who will be able to afford them. Senior management in the high-tech companies and the big vulture funds will be able to afford them. Senior legal professionals will be able to afford the rent, but not ordinary working families who made Ringsend the great community that it is today. Those who stayed when it was not a popular place rebuilt Ringsend into a vibrant community.	spk_369

I have been informed, however, that gardaí who had been selected for that training were told that it has been cancelled outright. The selected gardaí have been waiting since 2019 to take part in this armed support unit training. Armed support units across Dublin barely have enough resources to be operational and are only at 75% capacity. Ireland has a high rate of gun violence. Our gun murder rate is six times that of Britain. Amid a deadly feud in Finglas, which is spilling out into our own constituency in Dublin Bay South and right across the south inner city, why is the Government being so complacent at resourcing the ASU? The Government must intervene. The cancellation of ASU training courses must be undone. The training must be fast-tracked to bring armed support units up to full operational levels.	spk_389

It seeks to enact a wide range of reforms which will change the way in which judges are appointed in Ireland. We support the Bill although we will propose amendments to it to make it stronger. We must see the appointment of judges who truly reflect Irish society, not just a certain section of society. We must have judges who are in touch with all communities, especially working class communities because those communities live with the brutal reality of drug-related crime and antisocial behaviour. It is consistently said to me that judges are out of touch and leave gardaí fighting crime and social disorder with one arm tied behind their backs. Countless gardaí have told me how frustrating and disheartening their role has become due to out-of-touch judges. There are countless examples of violent offenders with 70 or 80 previous offences receiving suspended sentences from judges. Many violent offenders feel untouchable. This is having a devastating impact on local communities. It infuriates local residents and undermines the role of the gardaí. Previously in this Chamber I have raised various gang feuds and the ongoing social disorder. Recently, it was in Creighton Street in City Quay and prior to that it was in Grand Canal Docks. The gardaí struggle for the required resources, but they do a great job with the limited resources they have. We must have judges who are not afraid to hold offenders accountable. Some absolutely horrible crimes are committed in communities across the country and the leniency of the sentences takes one's breath away. Residents tell me that judges are out of touch with inner city communities. As was mentioned earlier, the cohort of people who are qualified to be judges is small. It will be extended slightly. For me, the challenge is that we cannot wait for the natural change to happen. We have to be proactive to ensure that the judges reflect the increasing diversity sooner rather than later.	spk_414

Dublin City Council management has indicated the prices of homes there will range from €600,000 to €700,000 per unit. Obviously, that is not affordable.

All these wars are extremely challenging for Europe. The brutal war being raged by the Russian Government in Ukraine has no end in sight. President Zelenskyy has shown strong leadership since the war started, as he did in speaking to the joint Houses of the Oireachtas this morning. Day by day, more horrific accounts of war crimes are coming to light. These must be punished and Putin must be held responsible. We are witnessing increased violence in Palestine at the hand of apartheid Israel. There are illegal settlements and administrative detentions. The voices of Michael Lynk and Amnesty International are among an increasing number of reputable voices calling out Israel's apartheid nature. If we are going to be consistent in our condemnation of terror, Israel must be sanctioned for its crimes, which have made a two-state solution virtually impossible. War in Yemen is destroying countless lives with the arms industry in Europe the only beneficiary as it makes eye-watering profits. If we are going to be consistent, Saudi Arabia must be sanctioned for its crimes. From the Council of Europe to the UN Security Council, Ireland needs to be a progressive voice and a leader for developing nations such as Western Sahara, which for years was under European colonial rule and is now under Moroccan occupation. Ireland is a small nation and needs to be a voice for other small nations such as Western Sahara.

The difference is that in the inner city, Dublin City Council is responsible for these empty homes. A short walk from here I could show the Minister ten empty flats that are boarded up. That is ten homes that could house people in homelessness or in overcrowded or unsafe conditions. Dublin City Council flats can be empty for months. There needs to be a speedier process to reactivate the flats. In some cases, flats are empty for nearly a year. Some flats are empty while plans are put in place for regeneration or redevelopment but the process of redeveloping flats is tortuously slow and as a consequence, homes are left empty for a very long time. One development that is a five-minute walk from here on Fenian Street is a very good example. The council met residents of St. Andrew's Court three or four years ago and put proposals to them for redevelopment. It is a big redevelopment plan and while people were concerned and anxious about it, generally it was welcomed. People were happy that public housing would be built on public land. However, the process is absolutely crawling and the homes at St. Andrew's Court have been empty for years. Approximately 15 flats are just sitting there, empty and the project is only at the design team stage.  Pearse House residents are also facing a regeneration scheme but if it is going to take as long as St. Andrew's Court, it will be a disaster for residents living in the inner city who are under huge pressure and in desperate need of housing. The turnaround of voids also needs to be accelerated. There are five or six voids in Pearse House at the moment. People who are living in horrendous conditions are looking at flats that are boarded up, empty and derelict. The turnaround of voids and the process for the regeneration of flat complexes such as Pearse House and St. Andrew's Court needs to be fast-tracked. If it is not fast-tracked, it amounts to neglect of the residents who are living in accommodation that nobody in 2022 should be expected to live in. It is often said that Pearse House is a beautifully built art deco building and, indeed, the architecture is lovely but for people having to live there, it is a sentence. That is just not acceptable and it must be changed. Redevelopment must be fast-tracked. We cannot have people living in substandard accommodation for years and years when the process can be speeded up through fast-tracking.	spk_274

I send my continued solidarity to the people of Ukraine. The resilience and courage they have shown is inspiring. Every day they are enduring the brutal and deadly reality of Russian aggression.It has been uplifting to see the rapid response, from here and from the rest of Europe, and the opening of doors to give shelter and support to those fleeing this war of aggression. A notable player in this regard has been the Red Cross. It has been doing amazing work and it is important to acknowledge that. Rarely have we seen sporting organisations take a stand in wars. This has changed in the context of Ukraine and Russia, but this change must be applied equally. We saw the decisive pressure applied to Roman Abramovich that pushed him to begin the process of selling Chelsea Football Club. We have also seen powerful acts of solidarity with Ukraine by sports fans in stands right across the world. What worries me now is the lack of continuity from the sporting community. It feels selective in what wars it opposes. Newcastle United Football Club is now effectively owned by the Saudi Arabian government. Last Sunday, the second round of the Formula One championship was hosted there. This is the Saudis whitewashing their terror. Saudi Arabia is waging a brutal and illegal war on the people of Yemen, where nearly 400,000 women, children and men have died. Only last year, an Algerian athlete, Fethi Nourine, and his coach were banned from competing for ten years for refusing to compete against an athlete from apartheid Israel. How can anyone justify that ten-year ban? Drug cheats in sports have got significantly shorter bans of a few months or years. Where is the consistency? It seems that the world's sporting federations view some wars as brutal and oppressive and others as none of their business. Waving a Palestinian flag at a UEFA match will result in a club being fined, but it is okay, rightly, for fans to wave a Ukrainian flag. This is the sort of inconsistency our international sports bodies need to address.

Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-03-30	dail	33	Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_14	There are some important elements to the Bill which I welcome. Overall, we welcome the Bill. We will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage. The provision to use CCTV in some circumstances to catch illegal dumping is welcome. It will be welcomed in many flat complexes around my constituency. Residents in the likes of Bishop Street, not too far from here, are scourged by people throwing rubbish in the bin storage areas and making them unsafe and unhealthy. That leads to rats and seagulls making the bin areas a particularly disgusting space in many flat complexes. These areas need to be designed and managed much better than they are. The Rathmines flats bin storage area and the Glovers Court bin storage area, again not far from here, are unhealthy and unsafe. Residents are afraid to open the lid of the bin container because they are not sure what will scurry out, so bags are not always thrown into the bin container but are left there. This highlights the need for local authorities to design bin storage areas to a higher standard. It was reported to me recently that a van regularly comes into the bin storage area in Countess Markiewicz House on the other side of the city and dumps bags. They leave very little room for residents to dump their rubbish safely, cleanly and effectively. It is welcome that CCTV and drones will be able to be used for prosecutions. In the inner city and the flat complexes it is important. I hope local authorities will be able to use CCTV and the Bill will make that applicable for sites like Countess Markiewicz House and the flat complexes. Deputy Lahart mentioned the excessive use of plastic packaging. We all wonder why so much of it is used. Many products are wrapped, double-wrapped or triple-wrapped. We all need to challenge ourselves. Like Deputy Lahart, I leave plastic and packaging behind in shops. In fairness, the shops I go into and where I leave the packaging behind are very accommodating. It is welcome that the Minister will be able to target this type of packaging. We must reduce what we are sending to the incinerator, which of course is a blight that was foisted on the community of Ringsend. If we can reduce the packaging and waste going to the incinerator, this will be good legislation.	spk_269

The fear people feel when they find out their child is neurodiverse is heartbreaking because they know so many people in their situation who have been failed and they know that the same is in store for them. I know the Minister of State gets that but it seems the Government has no handle on how to get services up to an acceptable standard. It knows the questions but it is not delivering the answers that parents of children with disabilities need. When I hear Ministers speak in the Dáil or in the media, if feels like they have no power to change the way that business is done. They sound more like interested commentators than actual Ministers. The number of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes in Dublin 6 is a very significant issue. The process under section 37A of the Education Act 1998 has delivered no extra places. Advocacy groups such as Involve Autism have highlighted the failure of this process in delivering ASD classes in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W. More than €70,000 is spent every day busing autistic children out of their communities to go to schools a long distance from their homes. In the morning, one child in a family will turn right while another will get onto a bus and have to leave their home. It is absolutely bonkers. A child in Pearse Street has to get on a bus or in a taxi and travel to Clontarf, on the other side of the city, to get to school. How does that make any sense?  This is ultimately the Minister's responsibility. The Department does not have the information it needs to plan for school places. The process of diagnosis starts with the Minister. The diagnosis of children is very important because, without such a diagnosis, children regress and cannot access the services they need to reach their full potential. If we are going to meet the demand for school places, we need children to be assessed as early as possible. The Minister needs to ensure that the HSE fulfils its obligations under the Disability Act. Families feel abandoned and the Government is ultimately responsible.	spk_208

Its architects wanted to ensure the interests of capital did not ride roughshod over those of labour and that big business could not smother wider social concerns in post-war democracies. This system rested upon several things: capital controls, fixed exchange rates and the US dollar, backed by a gold standard as its anchor. There were high rates of taxation on capital which were recycled back through high levels of public investment. The policy target was full employment. It was a time when trade unions were strong and finance was weak. Inequality was low and labour’s share of GDP was at an historic high. In the English-speaking world, it was known as the “golden age of capitalism”, the Japanese called it the “economic miracle” and, following its establishment in 1957, it lasted for almost three decades. What followed then was the onset of neoliberalism and a very different system of global financial management. Capital accounts were liberalised and exchange rates floated with fiat currencies, backed by nothing more than the promise to pay. Low rates of taxation on capital prevailed, with the consequence of low levels of public investment with creaking public infrastructure. Now, the policy target was price stability. Inequality moved back towards the levels of the gilded age, trade unions were weakened and finance was strong and highly mobile. Today, capital’s share of GDP is at historic highs. This era has been given various names from across the political spectrum: secular stagnation, financialisation, late-stage capitalism and so on. Regardless of the term that is used, it is pointing to a system that is not serving the needs or the interests of people. If we want an explanation for populism, that is where we start. We support this Bill but we also have concerns. We have concerns about whether the IMF has finally woken up to that reality. The IMF, to its credit, has been on something of a journey of self-reflection in recent times. Its research department has led out on this and it has produced important research papers which question ideas that it once held to be conventional wisdom.Its path-breaking article, ""Neoliberalism: Oversold?"", concluded that ""Instead of delivering growth, some neoliberal policies have increased inequality"".  It has produced important research supporting the introduction of wealth taxes to help recover from the pandemic and even has produced research demonstrating how taxing the rich is good for growth. This is a far cry from the disastrous trickle-down economics we once got. My only concern is whether the IMF's board of governors have joined the research department on the road to reform. The Bill will mean our participation in the NAB facility. As part of this, we will contribute to IMF loans to eligible countries in difficulty. We have no problem supporting those in need. However, those loans will come with conditions. In the past, such conditions have included increased labour market flexibility, which has been code for lowering wages, loosening employment rights and weakening trade unions. It meant undertaking pro-cyclical measures like reducing government borrowing and raising interest rates in a time of recession. Conditions have included signing up to structural adjustment programmes, which has meant the privatisation of public goods, the fire sale of state assets and the deregulation of markets. This Bill will rename the enhanced structural adjustment facility trust as the poverty reduction and growth trust. I hope that symbolises something more than just changing the name on the label of the loan product. I hope the IMF board of governors has learned from the mistakes of the past, just as its research department has. I hope the IMF recognises that we need to get back to a system of global financial management more akin to the Bretton Woods system than what we have today. There is a major realignment taking place in the world and the unipolar moment is coming to an end. "	spk_303

Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-03-24	dail	33	Planning and Development (Protect Social Housing) Bill 2020: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_38	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time.""I thank the Minister of State for arriving. I know he had other plans, but such is life. This is a Bill to amend the Planning and Development 2000 and to repeal section 97(3)(b). The Bill arises because of the scrapping of height guidelines by the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2018. There are a number of strands leading to this Bill. First, under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, each private developer must provide 10% social housing under the rule commonly known as ""Part V"". Second, the scrapping of the height guidelines by the previous Minister with responsibility for the environment in 2018 creates a lacuna in the legislation. Third, any site that is 0.1 ha or smaller is exempt from the requirement to transfer units to the local authority for housing under Part V. Small sites which were just for developing up to ten homes were and are exempt from providing public housing. This Bill is not about going after the family home, a second home or even a small builder building a few homes. It is about stopping developers taking advantage of the gap in the legislation. I have a question which the Minister of State might answer later. If there is already an exemption for small developments of fewer than ten homes, why was there also an exemption based on the area or footage of the ground? This Bill will remove this exemption by deleting section 97(3)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000. We realised there was a gap in the legislation when planning permission was granted for the development on York Road in Ringsend of a seven-storey apartment block. Having been granted permission for seven storeys, the developer then reapplied for planning permission to change the build to a 15-storey apartment block with 48 new homes and no public housing. The second application for 15 storeys was rejected, but if it had been granted the developer would have been exempt from making the 10% contribution to the local authority for public homes. If the new plans had been given the go-ahead, this would have set a dangerous precedent for the development of the area, likely to be replicated elsewhere throughout the city and in other urban areas and built-up settings. It should be noted that the approved application for the seven-storey development has not even been started. The developer has not gone near it. The main reason the 15-storey application was blocked is the huge campaign that was organised by residents, Shay Connolly, Orla Murphy and many others. They engaged with residents, knocked door to door and let people know what was happening. They mobilised and held public meetings outdoors in the park during the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a campaign that was successful and engaged people. It was really positive. People were interested and it was great to see the energy that campaign brought. This building would have been as high as Liberty Hall, towering over artisan red-brick cottages. It would have been, effectively, a Trojan horse for developer-led development in Ringsend. It would have allowed developers to build higher and higher along the river front of the Liffey and up to the quays. The campaign raised great awareness within the community of the issue of developer-led developments and the need for the community to be active, aware and mobilised. That is certainly what happened. This development would be very much out of character with the street, where the average homes are red-bricked artisan one-storey dwellings, next to a school. These small artisan dwellings would have been towered over by a 15-storey block. Many other sites are building fewer units, yet they make a contribution through Part V. The loophole has understandably angered the local community. Ringsend is an area that has a considerable need for social and affordable housing, as is the case in communities across the inner city. Two and three generations of families are living in two-bedroom and three-bedroom flats and towering beside these families a developer is trying to avoid his obligation to provide public housing. It is rubbing salt into the wounds. The community has developed and worked on this area to make it fantastic. It is an attractive area with parks, sports clubs and community facilities. Developers are now swooping in on the back of the fantastic work the community has done over the years to make Ringsend an attractive area in which to live. These developers are going to maximise their profits and avoid doing anything for the community. They will avoid it like the plague. All they want is to maximise their profits. This developer is a prime example of this mindset, and will just make money for the investors. The developer will promote and market this development using all the facilities the community has fought hard to build over the decades. At the same time, the developer is avoiding providing housing in the area, which has a real need for social housing. The amount of three generations living in a single house in Ringsend is phenomenal. It is not inconceivable that a developer with 0.3 ha could divide the site into three smaller parcels using different shell companies and build 120 homes and still be exempt from the 10% contribution under Part V. Stranger things have happened. Ringsend must have a local area plan developed or the area will continue to have developer-led housing and community development. The residents' community development group made a submission to the development plan which outlined a vision for Ringsend and a vision that other communities can aspire to. Across the inner city many working families are being locked out of home ownership. The cost of a one-bedroom home is now €442,000 in Ringsend. It is absolute madness. Ordinary people, families and workers are expected to pay that. They just cannot afford it.They are being pushed out of their communities and pushed down the country. The cost of building a unit at the new glass bottle site is between €400,000 and €500,000. The development has stalled because Roadbridge has gone into receivership, but that is a separate issue. These will not be affordable to ordinary families. These homes will be occupied by the vulture funds and the well-paid staff of the high-tech companies. There are many high-tech companies and they have thrown a lot of shade at the local community. In other areas in the inner city, developers are looking for small plots of land and will be going higher and higher with the price. At the same time, they will avoid the provision of social housing. The high-tech companies are coming into the inner city and require homes for their staff. The lack of housing and the cost of what is there is a big disincentive when trying to attract staff. They are investing in property and this is pushing up the prices of homes, putting them out of the reach of ordinary workers and families. I would not be surprised if they were not looking at a site for future development to house their staff. It is natural. This is what they have to do, it is what they are being allowed to do and it is what they are being encouraged to do. This is understandable but it has a huge knock-on effect on what is traditionally a working class community. This community has been neglected for years and is now being squeezed out as a result of Government policies that give free rein to the big high-tech companies. Government policy allows the high-tech companies and the vulture funds to work hand in hand to come in, buy up properties and drive working families out of the area. Affordability is an issue. If the gaps in legislation we have identified are not sealed, as is the intention behind the Bill, developers will be able to avoid providing any public housing. The numbers on the social housing list are increasing daily. Without public housing, these communities will become increasingly fragmented. Flat complexes in inner-city communities have been neglected for decades. Look at the conditions in the Pearse House, Macken Street and Whitefriar Gardens complexes. It is unbelievable that families are allowed to live in these conditions. They are hard-working families who have worked throughout Covid. They are expected to live in these conditions. There are rats, raw sewage is overflowing and there are lighting defects. It is dangerous to live in many of these flats, and it is just not right. This neglect has to be reversed. Our inner-city communities deserve better and our city deserves better. Developers will be able to slip through the fence and avoid providing housing on small plots of land unless the Bill is passed. This is not only an issue in Ringsend; it will happen throughout the city and the remainder of the country unless the gap in legislation is filled. This Bill would fill that gap."	spk_357
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-03-24	dail	33	Planning and Development (Protect Social Housing) Bill 2020: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_38	I agree with everything Deputy Ó Broin said. It is very disappointing and the residents in Pearse Street and Ringsend will be equally disappointed. The Minister of State listed off a range of measures, but he did not say what the negative unintended consequences of the Bill would be. It will protect communities. The application in Ringsend was for 15 storeys and there were going to be 48 units on a site of 0.1 ha. Five of those units should have gone to public housing. That means five homes lost and five families on the housing list who will miss out because of that exemption. The developer clearly sees it as a loophole. No one is saying the development needs to be stopped. Someone developing 40 or 50 units should make their contribution to public housing as set out in the law for everybody else. As the Minister of State knows, the housing list is getting longer every day. It is not about stopping development. A comment was made to me recently about this Bill. The individual said it is getting harder to build. This is not about stopping anybody from building. It is not about going after a small developer building three or four units. This is this is about the developer who sees an opportunity to drive a wedge through a loophole in the law. I ask the Minister of State to explain to me how closing this loophole would have negative consequences for other communities. I cannot see that. I ask him to give some indication as to what those negative consequences would be if this were deleted. There is already an exemption for people producing three, four or five homes. Why do we need to have an exemption for somebody developing on 0.1 ha? The studies were done before the guidelines. In 2018, the then Minister, Eoghan Murphy, scrapped the height guidelines and developers can now go as high as they like. It will be like having Liberty Hall in the middle of Ringsend, towering over the artisan dwellings and the one-storey cottages. It is completely inappropriate. The developer was going to sell this particular development on the back of all the hard work the community has done. That will be replicated throughout the country. I find it hard to see any unintended consequences. I again ask the Minister of State to point them out. The developers are taking advantage of the hard work of volunteers in the community. This Bill would close a loophole in the legislation that needs to be closed. Like Deputy Ó Broin, I ask the Minister of State to come back with something else to close the loophole.	spk_361

Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-03-23	dail	33	European Arrest Warrant (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_14	I welcome the Bill. It is important that laws relating to European arrest warrants are brought up to date with the European Council's framework decision of 2002. That is long overdue. As a result of the delay in doing it, infringement proceedings were initiated in 2020 by the European Commission against Ireland. What is proposed with regard to the European arrest warrant will update the current extradition system between member states. There is a clear objective here, namely, to permit the free movement of judicial decisions in criminal matters across the EU. While I welcome the Bill, there are, however, aspects that need to be clarified. Where will the Court of Appeal stand in the context of European arrest warrants if the Bill is enacted? I am also concerned that certain parts of the Bill are excessive, such as the provision relating to the extradition of someone to serve out a sentence of just four months. There is no option within the Bill for minor sentences to be served within the Irish prison system. Will the Minister of State clarify the position in this regard? Sinn Féin will support the Bill, but we will table amendments to correct flaws and strengthen different aspects of it. While we are on the subject, it is important to note the abuses carried out by some states. Countries such as Great Britain have used requests for extradition to suppress civil liberties. Most notably, Julian Assange remains in a maximum-security prison despite not being charged with a crime in Britain. The charges he faces in the United States are politically motivated. This view is shared by every major press freedom organisation. The charges he faces are also a serious attack on journalism. It gives the green light to imprison journalists for simply doing their job. The abuses and suppression of civil liberties that Julian Assange endures at the hands of the British Government should not be tolerated by the international community. The fact that it is tolerated on the grounds of an extradition case is an absolute disgrace. The Government is like disinterested passersby when it should be shouting stop. Using the extradition process as a tool for political attack cannot be tolerated.	spk_144
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-03-22	dail	33	Rising Energy Costs: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_9	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion which in reality reflects people's everyday circumstances. The rising cost of living is being felt across communities, whether in Ringsend, Donnybrook, Kimmage or Kevin Street. It is the issue that people are raising with me. People have to decide between heating or eating. That is of huge concern to everybody in this House. Everyone is feeling the pressure of these rising costs. Recent research from Red C on behalf of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul found that 30% of people have had to cut back on essential heating and electricity costs and approximately 20% have had to cut back on essential food costs. We know who feels these sharp increases in the cost of living most. Low and middle-income workers and their families are hit hardest. These households must spend a higher proportion of their income on food and fuel. Week after week, they are left with less of their disposable income. This is having a devastating impact on inner city communities across Dublin. The rising cost of living and the housing crisis are ripping these communities apart. For so many, these rising costs are making the hope of owning a home or renting within their community almost impossible. The rising cost of renting swallows a large chunk of most people's salaries and many people feel suffocated by all of these rising costs. This devastates local communities, families and couples who simply want to settle down and start a family. So many of these young people are being forced out of their communities in search of housing. We need to see a meaningful suite of measures put in place to ease the burden on people. This motion brings forward a wide range of measures aimed at easing that burden and giving households much-needed support and a break. It includes a cost of living payment of €200 for adults on an income of less than €30,000 per annum and €100 for those on between €30,000 and €60,000 per annum, further reductions in excise duty on petrol and diesel and the temporary removal of excise duty on home heating oil. This is what is needed. I support this motion.	spk_148

There is a real sense of fear among residents in the City Quay area in particular. They are worried about the ongoing street violence that is occurring almost every day. They are virtually being held hostage. Last Saturday week, a young 13-year-old was hospitalised after being stabbed. Thankfully, he will make a full recovery, although I understand it will take a while. It is amazing that someone has not been killed because when you see the knives and weapons seized by the Garda it seems to only be a matter of time before some child or young person will be killed. Then there will be a big outcry and we will say that we should have done this or that. The reality is we need something done now. I completely understand that there is no simple or overnight solution and people recognise that. Gangs of young people are rampaging and cycling through streets like Townsend Street and smashing cars for the sake of it, and because they can. It is unrelenting and it is unacceptable that residents have to put up with it. Action is needed. If these groups of youths were outside the Minister of State's house, my house or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's house, it would not be allowed and it should not be allowed outside the homes of residents in City Quay. No one should have to put up with this issue. I accept that the Garda is in a difficult position in that the young people carrying out this street violence are almost all children, which brings challenges. The Garda needs to be resourced better right across the inner city. It needs more resources to work with young people and the community section of the Garda needs to be more involved. More resources also need to be allocated to community development and youth work groups. It is hard to imagine, given what is happening in the south and north inner city, that the local Talk about Youth group has no dedicated space to work from. Talk about Youth does fantastic work with young people in the community yet it has no place to call home and no dedicated space. It needs a dedicated space in which it can develop its projects and work with young people who are particularly hard to engage with. There needs to be funding for assertive outreach teams to do work with young people who are resistant to engaging with traditional youth groups. There are some local children involved in this but the majority come from quite a distance from the city centre. This 13-year-old came from Dublin 15 to the inner city on a Saturday night. We are failing as a society and we are failing to work with young people to address the issues. The Mulvey report allocated funding and resources for the north inner city and that has to be replicated in the south inner city because the north and south inner city are one community.	spk_2

It is not acceptable. They need action and more gardaí, and they need it now. I completely accept that it is not a simple solution. I proposed a while ago that the bridge should be opened so that it would divert them. People felt that they had moved to another bridge further down. That may be the case, but then it may not be the case if the gardaí are proactive and have the resources they badly need. The Mulvey report outlined that the north inner city should have extra resources. Equally, the south inner city should have the same resources because they are one community. The docklands authority, before it became a developers' charter, worked with north and south inner city communities and saw them as one, and that is what the Government needs to do.	spk_4

Senator Sherlock has put a great deal of work into it. It is a very timely motion. Prior to Covid, I would have been a sceptic about flexible working. I always believed it would not work. Following on from Covid, I am a strong advocate for it. It can make a significant difference to employers and employees. I understand why employers would be reluctant. It is a big change, but the reality is there is no going back. Everything has changed. From an employer's perspective, the improvement in the employee's work-life balance means the employee will be happier and as a result will work more efficiently and effectively. It is a win-win for everybody. The environmental benefits are huge as well. As mentioned by Deputy Mythen, people will not be stuck in cars or at bus stops. It is a win-win for everybody. The Government needs to embrace flexible working. I do not get any sense that it is looking to do that. There are significant opportunities for employers if they are open-minded about it and if they embrace and engage with the process. The conversation on remote working has been gradually growing over the years. In the eyes of many, the conversation on remote working was not moving fast enough. We have seen huge technological developments which can enable remote working. We all know now that there are times when in-person meetings are not necessary. It seems pointless sometimes when the work could be done in half the time over a Zoom call. There have been huge improvements in technology. With the onset of Covid-19, when thousands of workers were suddenly required to work remotely, the technological developments made it clear how smooth a transition it can be. If the employers embrace this, it will be a win-win for everybody.	spk_50

It is a really important service. Various issues with the issuing and renewing of permits and driving licences have had a severe impact on the lives of workers and their families over the past two years. We heard from numerous front-line workers about the difficulties they faced in renewing their driving licences and the impact on their work. It is disappointing that the NDLS no longer offers a walk-in service and that it refuses to accept cash payments. On the PSC, it sounds in theory like people will not need one but in practice they do need it. This is in spite of a previous investigation by the Data Protection Commission which found there is no lawful basis for this requirement. The whole process is a prime example of the downgrading of public services due to Government services being privatised. An Post operates a network of some 950 post offices around the State. It is a devastating indictment of the Government's view of An Post that it will not engage with or involve the postal service in this process. The awarding of this contract to the Swiss company, SGS, reflects a missed opportunity to use the post office network and bring the NDLS into every community, ensuring ease of access to all. Removing the walk-in and cash services shows the level of disconnect between the Government and ordinary people. There are many people who need that bit of extra assistance, including the elderly and those from minority backgrounds. Many of those people might not have a PSC. They may have literacy barriers. Sinn Féin has previously called for the PSC to be scrapped following the report from the UN on the disproportionate impact it has on marginalised communities. I welcome and support the motion because it highlights the serious issues currently with the NDLS.	spk_42

I would like to be able to speak Irish and probably should have done more when I was younger to allow me to do so. Despite that, I feel strongly about how important Irish is in protecting our culture and identity. There is significant growing demand across Dublin Bay South for access to secondary school education through the medium of Irish. This creates a serious issue. There are a number of primary Gaelscoileanna in the area, such as Gaelscoil Lios na nÓg, Scoil Bhríde in Ranelagh, Scoil Mológa in Harold's Cross and Bunscoil Synge Street, which is a new school. Students who wish to continue their education through Irish have no access to a Gaelcholáiste locally. They must either travel significant distances to get that education through Irish or switch to the English medium. Parents in the community have done Trojan work in highlighting the urgent need for a Gaelcholáiste. The time has come to listen to parents and common sense and establish a Gaelcholáiste in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W.	spk_339

I welcome the opportunity for Members to speak on this groundbreaking report by Amnesty International. I commend the team at Amnesty on the years of research that went into it. I understand it took four years to complete and it is a solid piece of research. Ireland has a long and proud tradition of support for and solidarity with the people of Palestine. While many of the crimes of Israel's apartheid have long been raised in the Dáil, the EU's central involvement in the arms trade to Israel has seldom been raised. EU members have profited well from Israeli apartheid over the years. Since 2012, EU member states have sold arms to Israel to the tune of nearly €700 million per year. Between 2014 and 2018, Germany and Italy alone supplied 35% of Israel's arms imports. EU states make large profits selling deadly arms to states like Israel that frequently abuse international law and suppress and murder peaceful protestors. Ireland currently sits on the UN Security Council and is in a prime position to bring forward proposals highlighted in the Amnesty report, such as an arms embargo. The report, along with other recent reports, clearly shows that Israel fails the standards of the EU Council's common position on the arms trade. Criterion two clearly states that there must be ""[r]espect for human rights in the country of final destination as well as respect by that country of international humanitarian law"".Israel clearly does not comply with criterion two. Last week I spoke in the Chamber of how Israel’s occupation forces shot a 13-year-old child, stripped him naked and let him bleed out on the pavement. There is a long list of these murders and crimes. In June 2018 an Israeli sniper shot Rouzan al-Najjar, a 21-year-old paramedic. She was shot through the chest and through her white coat which clearly marked her as a paramedic. She was tending to two injured protestors when she was murdered. Amnesty International believes that Rouzan was wilfully killed, making her murder a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and a war crime. Let it be clear in the Dáil that EU states are empowering Israel to carry out these war crimes and its apartheid policies. We are facilitating it and we are part of the problem. The Oireachtas needs to officially recognise Israel’s apartheid against Palestinians and there can be embargoes. The UK imposed a 12-year embargo on Israel a number of years ago under Margaret Thatcher. That was one of the few things Margaret Thatcher did well but we are not even willing to step up to the plate and do that. We have to be outspoken and we have to lead but at the moment we are not doing so. We also have to recognise that Israel is an apartheid state."	spk_382

Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-02-23	dail	33	Security Situation in Europe: Statements	dbsect_19	I acknowledge the presence of the ambassador and I welcome her. For weeks we have seen the geopolitical battle between NATO and Russia being played out and the ordinary people of Ukraine getting caught in the middle. It has received prime coverage from almost all Irish media. On Monday night came the news from the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, that Russia had formally announced recognition of the two breakaway republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. Until then we had been watching the slow demise of the Minsk II agreement. This agreement was mediated with great effort and diplomacy by France and Germany. They brought all of the parties to the table. They developed a resolution that gave hope for peace and stability in the region and the reintegration of the breakaway republics back into Ukraine. Monday's announcement marked the death of the Minsk II agreement. Now we seem further than ever away from that hope for peace and stability. The reality is that NATO and its EU members will make sufficient financial gains from all of this instability. The military-industrial complex has seen a steady increase in the value of its stocks and shares since the crisis began. Millions upon millions worth of lethal arms produced in Europe are flooding into Ukraine. Much of this will end up in the hands of far-right paramilitaries who have no desire for peace. Recently An Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, carried out a trade mission to Saudi Arabia. It should be noted the Saudi Arabian Government is one of the biggest clients for European arms, with EU arms purchased by Saudi Arabia frequently ending up in war-torn regions. The brutal war that has been prosecuted on the Yemeni people by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is too often forgotten by the EU. Tens of thousands of Yemeni men, women and children have been killed or maimed by bombs and bullets supplied by EU governments. Where is the outcry against Saudi Arabia? Where are the sanctions and arms embargoes? How do arms sales to Saudi Arabia help EU defence and security? They do not. We need to see the EU follow the example set by the UN in the 1970s in the fight against apartheid. Ireland needs to be a leading voice in the EU for an urgent arms embargo on the apartheid state of Israel. Last week, unarmed 19 year old Nehad Barghouti was shot dead at a protest by the Israeli occupation forces in the West Bank. Only last night we heard of a 14-year-old child being murdered by Israeli apartheid occupation forces. The soldiers stripped the child naked and prevented ambulances from reaching him, letting him die on a pavement in the West Bank. Between 2015 and 2020 Germany exported more than €1 billion worth of arms to Israel and Italy exported more than €300 million worth of arms to Israel. Last year, Israel's 11 day military campaign killed at least 253 people, including 66 children in Gaza. How many of these 253 men, women and children were killed by EU weapons? How long will the EU stay silent while EU member states make large profits selling weapons to this apartheid state?

Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-02-17	dail	33	National Retrofitting Scheme: Statements	dbsect_33	Everybody welcomes the package of supports as part of the delivery of Ireland’s residential retrofit programme but I suppose the devil is in the detail. As Deputy O’Rourke mentioned, the 80% scheme is very limited. We are effectively funding the well off in that we are giving wealthy people, in particular, 50% of their upgrade cost. Just like homeowners, those renting from Dublin City Council would love the opportunity to have their homes insulated. Commitments were made years ago to insulate the flats at Glover Court but that never happened. As Members know, flats such as those at Glover Court and Rathmines Avenue, in addition to those in the vast majority of Dublin City Council flat complexes, are in desperate need of regeneration. After years of neglect, it is vital that residents living in public housing have a decent home to live in. Residents living in council-owned flats have been neglected for long enough. They have effectively been abandoned by the State. Residents in council-owned houses and flats have long dreamt of having their homes insulated to a modern standard. With the new scheme, they have been left behind once again. I have not heard any of the previous contributors mention flat complexes. The tenants are sceptical, which is understandable. The council’s long track record speaks for itself: it will not spend money to get rid of the rats and infestation and clean up the bin areas, nor will it spend money to remedy the dampness, water and sewage leaks, and broken windows and doors. Bin storage areas in flat complexes are mostly unacceptable and only encourage the gathering of rats and seagulls. To residents, having their homes insulated by the same landlord that has neglected them for years seems like a distant aspiration. The council has plans for insulation but it also had plans to fix the defects and dampness, but this never happened. Therefore, it is easy to understand why residents in flat complexes would be cynical and sceptical. Having a well-insulated, warm, dry home seems like a faraway dream when there is overcrowding to the extent that it is impossible to keep dampness and condensation away. It is all very well discussing insulation when there are three or four children sharing a tiny boxroom and the mother or father is on the couch. Insulation is welcome if it happens. I have not heard a real commitment that flat complexes will be insulated properly, funded and prioritised. They have been abandoned and neglected for long enough.	spk_246

I know she shows huge empathy with the people she works with. That said, I cannot see this Bill making a huge difference, or any difference, to neurodiverse children who are being bused out of their communities with strangers. More than €70,000 per day is being spent in south Dublin alone to transport autistic children out of their communities in this way. That is just south Dublin and it would be interesting to know what the entire national figure is. A freedom of information request went in and it was established that €72,000 per day was spent transporting children to classes outside of their communities each day. How can this be justified? How will this Bill change that waste? Why can neurodiverse children not have the expectation that they will be able to walk to school with their brothers and sisters? This Bill will not make any difference to the parents in south Dublin who cannot get a place in the same school as their other siblings. Despite a 37-day process, schools in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W have not opened any new classes. A relatively new school in Sandymount, the Shellybanks Educate Together National School, has not opened a new class even though it has the space within that footprint. Earlier this week I was talking to one parent who was in tears in the middle of the street telling me about the fear and desperation their family had when they were told there was no place for their child in a class in September. This worry and fear is all-consuming for the family and it is crippling them. It is not a debate for today but no school should be allowed to open without having an autism class and that goes for primary and secondary schools. This Bill will not make any difference to the parents who are waiting years to have their children assessed.If the Bill could make a difference to service provision then parents of neurodiverse children would be delighted but it is hard to see how shuffling around the chairs will make a difference to children with autism and their parents. It is a real challenge for them and spending so much transporting children out of their communities is no way to treat them and their families.	spk_328
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-02-09	dail	33	National Minimum Wage: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	"I welcome the opportunity to support this motion. The word ""crisis"" appears to go hand in hand with this Government. We have gone from one crisis to the next and now we have reached a crisis in the cost of living. Some in the Government seem to think the solution is to stop complaining and to shop around. People do shop around, but some cannot do so because of barriers. Those people who are struggling are invariably on low pay and the minimum wage. The reality is that working on the minimum wage puts individuals and families at increased risk of poverty. According to the CSO, approximately 120,000 people earn the minimum wage or less in Ireland. Approximately 110,000 people in Ireland live below the poverty line, despite being in employment. It is easy to forget that every single one of these numbers represents a person, someone struggling to get by, to survive and to provide for themselves and their family. How does it reflect on us as a society to have such a large number of people living in or on the edge of poverty? What does it say about the coalition Government when it fails to act where it can to improve the standard of living for these workers and their families? The measure of a State is how we support and protect the more vulnerable, yet the Government seems more concerned about protecting vulture funds and big developers rather than ordinary workers. Increasing the minimum wage will give the Government the clearest opportunity to put thousands of workers and their families out of poverty. It would start to give working families the quality of life they deserve. It is not just good for the individuals but also good for the wider community. If the Government fails to act as energy and housing prices continue to spiral out of control, the cost of living will continue to worsen and put thousands of people at risk of poverty because so many are so close to the cliff, looking into that dark abyss. Sinn Féin has outlined measures that would make a difference. I accept there are elements the Government cannot influence or change, but there are many things the Government can do and it needs to do them."	spk_35
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-02-03	dail	33	Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_39	The rising cost of energy and the overall costs of living are on the minds of everybody. When meeting residents and community groups, whether it is in Donnybrook, the inner city or Rathmines, we see that everybody is feeling the pressure as costs continue to rise. In the 12 months to December, inflation reached its highest level in 20 years. These high levels of inflation impact heavily on the daily lives of people in the State. We know who feels these sharp increases in inflation most. It is the working families who are hit hardest. These households must spend a higher proportion of their income on food and fuel. The cost of electricity has increased by 22%, the cost of gas is up 28% and home heating oil costs have risen by a staggering 53%. More families will be faced with the painful decision of having to choose between heating the house and feeding themselves. Measures must be taken by the Government to rein in inflation increases. While some factors may be outside of the Government's control, others certainly are not. The Government needs to step in to protect families from poverty. Provisions must be put in place to support low and middle income families. If the Government stands by, inflation and energy price spikes will push working families into poverty. We need to see meaningful actions, including the expansion of the fuel allowance scheme and the extension of the fuel allowance season by a further two weeks. The eligibility threshold for the allowance also needs to be increased by 10% to include approximately 30,000 additional homes. These are not radical measures but they will make a positive impact on many who are struggling. Already, several EU member states such as France, Italy and Spain have taken decisive action to reduce the burden of these price hikes on ordinary people. In Spain, consumers will see their average monthly bill drop by 22%. The market has failed to provide lower and more competitive prices for consumers. The Government must intervene in a meaningful way to ease the burden on the public. We cannot allow its market-led approach to continue. The Government needs to seek a special derogation to remove VAT on household energy bills. Such a move would reduce household bills by 12%. This would greatly ease the burden on so many people and give workers and their families a much-needed break. In housing, the market-led approach backed by the policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil has also failed. This approach and these policies have caused the housing crisis to worsen by the month. The increases in the cost of living are a direct result of those two parties' policies. For many, the idea of owning a home seems impossible. This does devastating damage to communities, families and couples wanting to start a family. The rising cost of renting swallows a large chunk of most people's salaries and many feel suffocated by all of these rising costs. We need a ban on rent increases and rents need to be brought under control. Measures such as a refundable tax credit, equivalent to one month's rent and capped at €1,500, would be a good start. It would give renters a much-needed break. We need to see this Government standing up for ordinary working families, not standing idly by.	spk_328
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-02-03	dail	33	Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_46	I commend my colleagues, Deputies Mairéad Farrell and Clarke, on the work they have put into the Bill. Transparency and accountability are cornerstones of any modern democracy and in the pursuit of transparency and accountability, the freedom of information process plays a vital role. Since the formation of this State we have seen Governments go to great lengths to hide official State information. There was infamous burning of Cabinet documents concerning the brutal policy of execution of republican prisoners during the Civil War, which is among the worst of the examples. Sadly, this State has a long and poor history when it comes to transparency and access to official State information. Other states have similar issues. In light of these failings, the public has been left reliant on individuals like Mr. Julian Assange and Mr. Edward Snowden. Were it not for their actions and those of others like them, information on countless crimes and abuses around the world would never have seen the light of day. The public should not be reliant on whistleblowers risking their lives and livelihoods to expose such injustice. As I speak, Mr. Assange remains in a maximum-security prison and Mr. Snowden will live out the rest of his days in exile, far from his home and family. What were their crimes but trying to give transparency and accountability to the public? For that reason, Mr. Assange should be freed. We in Ireland saw the horrific treatment endured by a former Garda sergeant, Mr. Maurice McCabe, including the creation of false reports and attempts at intimidation targeting him and his family. This demonstrates what can happen when transparency and accountability are lacking. The freedom of information process played a key role in events like the beef tribunal and the controversy involving the public services card. A well-functioning freedom of information regime is essential to any state that values the democratic process and it is an effective tool to give to the public for holding those in power to account. This Bill is an important step to broaden the current remit of the freedom of information process. In the interests of strengthening the democratic process, I urge all Deputies to support it.	spk_393

It is a real boost to everybody. It has given everybody a lift and it is welcome. The sporting community probably welcomed the easing of restrictions more than most. Sport plays a large part in our lives. It strengthens communities, teaches young people about health and well-being, and boosts the morale of the nation when we are cheering on our international athletes and stars.Under Sport Ireland, there are more than 40 affiliated sporting bodies covering a wide range of sports. While most people are used to hearing news of the big three, that is, the GAA, FAI and IRFU, the amazing work of many other smaller organisations such as Basketball Ireland, the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA, Athletics Ireland and Rowing Ireland, is too often forgotten. These smaller organisations carry out amazing work in communities right across Ireland and across all backgrounds. Locally in Ringsend, we have two amazing rowing clubs, St. Patrick's Rowing Club and Stella Maris Rowing Club. These two clubs are intertwined in the local community. They are essential for the community and a model for what community engagement should be. The success of sporting culture should be judged not only on the achievements of a few but on the strength and diversity of all sports on the island. The easing of Covid-19 restrictions has had a welcome impact on many of those sports, many of which are indoor-based, particularly basketball. Often, additional supports are carried out by voluntary groups such as St. John Ambulance Ireland, which provides medical support to sporting and community events throughout the country every week. St. John Ambulance Ireland is currently under review due to sexual abuse by its members and I am deeply concerned that amid this review into sexual abuse it continues to provide support to community and sporting events. I do not think it is appropriate for national sporting bodies such as the FAI, IRFU and GAA to avail of its services while a review into sexual abuse is ongoing. This is effectively a transfer of State funds to St. John Ambulance Ireland via sports organisations. I do not believe St. John Ambulance Ireland should be funded. Other organisations can do the same job and sporting bodies should engage with them rather than using St. John Ambulance Ireland. I again call on NGOs not to use St. John Ambulance Ireland at their sporting events and use alternative service providers.	spk_283

Ireland has been a leader in the pursuit of justice and fairness around the globe, and we have long recognised the importance of Palestinian civil society in pursuing justice and peace. Ireland's lack of action following the recent attacks on Palestinian NGOs is concerning.Last year saw significant increases by apartheid Israel in its targeting of Palestinian civil society groups, the settlements and the use of administrative detention. Ireland nods obediently while the European Commission is giving the green light to Israel to target NGOs with no fear of any consequences. Whatever happened to the concept of innocent until proven guilty? Why is the European Commission allowed to exercise double standards when it comes to civil society groups operating in Palestine? The Commission has frozen funding for these six civil society groups following unverified claims from apartheid Israel. Organisations like Al-Haq are considered guilty until they prove themselves innocent. We have seen it before where past allegations by the apartheid authorities of the misuse of EU funds have not been validated. Ireland must raise its voice and not hide in the European herd. We must demand that funding is released and the documentation that is being offered by Israel is made public. How long will we allow the European Union to be complicit in the crimes of apartheid Israel? I heard Deputy Haughey refer to the release of political prisoners in Belarus. The same applies for political prisoners held by Israel. The Palestinians are held with absolutely no trial - nothing. They are just arrested and held and they are literally tortured. That is not acceptable. Ireland has to stand up and make its voice heard and not hide behind the European Union.	spk_338
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-01-26	dail	33	Youth Mental Health: Statements	dbsect_18	This is an opportunity to speak about mental health, which is important to us all. We were in a mental health crisis pre-Covid and now this crisis has evolved into a mental health emergency. Jigsaw, an organisation which we all agree carries out amazing work on mental health among young people, has seen the realities of this at first hand. It has experienced a 42% increase in demand for services. It is well documented that participation in sport is beneficial for our mental health and overall well-being. There is a definite link between the positive benefits of physical activity and mental health. We need to explore and take a more in-depth approach to linking sport with tackling mental health. Every week, thousands of children across Ireland go to their local sports grounds for matches and training. Many of them will be active in their local clubs up to their late teens and beyond. They will develop strong connections and friendships with fellow players, coaches and volunteers. As a previous speaker said, it is about finding their tribe and young people very often do that through sport. I know sport is not for everyone but for those for whom it is, it is very important. Coaches and volunteers are in a prime position to promote a positive culture of well-being among teammates in their club. We need to provide them with the tools and resources to promote this positive culture of well-being and positive mental health. We also need to provide them with the supports and know-how to be able to identify people who are experiencing difficulty with their mental health. Under Sport Ireland, sporting organisations develop their own approach to well-being in sport, and some of these approaches are more in-depth than others. Over the years, the GAA has taken a proactive role in developing a strong culture of well-being in the organisation and should be commended on that. Now is the time to develop a uniform approach to well-being and mental health across all sporting organisations under Sport Ireland. Sports clubs are unique in that they are in a position to intervene early when a member is feeling unwell or having difficulties. They are on the front line and we need to resource them. Last year, Brian Murphy, a kind and generous young man who was a member of St. Patrick's Rowing Club in Ringsend, died by suicide. If sports clubs and organisations took a uniform approach and had structures and resources to identify people with mental health issues, I am certain there would be fewer people feeling as Brian Murphy did.	spk_440

It is long overdue. I understand it was proposed back in the 1970s. It is particularly welcome now. The Construction Federation of Ireland, CIF, has a voluntary register known as CIRI. Credit to the federation for setting up the register in the absence of action by Government. However, when you see the extensive list of building defects around the country, you would have to ask the federation how effective the register has been. I strongly believe that now that Government has decided to act and introduce the Bill, it is important there is independence from the construction sector. We cannot have the construction sector as the judge and jury on a register that is so important. There seems to be little point in having a two-year lead-in time. There is already a scheme in place, so let us use that one and make it independent and introduce it over a period of six to 12 months. This register should be placed under the management of the National Building Control Office. The Bill provides for the Minister to appoint committee members to the registration board. That is not the way appointments should be made. They should be made via the Public Appointments Service. Given the huge number of defects in modern developments, it is clear that there needs to be greater investment in the building control role of local authorities and a greater increase in the inspection of new builds. If this Bill was in place over the last 15 to 20 years, I would like to think that it would have given protection to residents in the docklands, in areas such as Gallery Quay and Longboat Quay. There are issues in Gallery Quay as a result of building defects. They will need to be addressed. It will involve a huge cost for the current residents. If this legislation had been in place earlier, developments such as Poolbeg Quay and Ringsend would not be facing the serious construction defects they are currently facing. It is unbelievable that 64 apartments were built and sold as they were. They were mortgaged by Dublin City Council. Two families believed their dreams had come true, but it is all turning into a nightmare for them. Everyone is washing their hands of the issues that they have. The only thing that is certain is that it is not the fault of residents in Poolbeg Quay. Homeowners in Poolbeg Quay should not have to pick up the tab. They will not be letting the matter go. They will fight for justice and fairness. It is not fair to expect residents to be held responsible for something not of their making. I will be standing with them. 	spk_460

Dublin 6 is an example of where the section 37A process in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 has ended with not a single ASD class.

I recognise and acknowledge the hard work done by my colleague Deputy Kathleen Funchion in ensuring that the Bill and the process has been thorough, efficient and the best it can be. Since the formation of the State, the routes available for accessing of information by adopted people in Ireland have provided little support and few answers. As a result, adopted people seeking information on their birth and early life information files have been left with no clear legislative framework. Sadly, the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 brings little hope of change. I acknowledge that the Bill will make some slight progress on the current situation, but it is very slight. Crucially, I believe that it fails to take on many of the recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. In fact, it has failed to take on board the most important recommendations. Yes, it has taken on some recommendations, but given that the report was only published on 14 December 2021, it seems that the Minister had already decided what he wanted to do with this particular legislation. With that in mind, we in Sinn Féin cannot support the Bill in its present form. We cannot have legislation that leaves some adopted people behind. We need inclusive legislation that provides all adopted people with the support and information to which they have a right. We have many concerns on what we view as major weaknesses within this legislation. The Bill fails to provide unrestricted access to birth certificates, adoption files and early life information. The definition of personal data is not clear. This weak definition leaves the door open to various interpretations. The narrow definitions used in the Bill are very concerning and they need to be expanded to include individual agencies and institutions involved in forced family separations. We need stronger definitions put in place. The method provided in the Bill for accessing records is hugely problematic. It allows only for part of the files to be released as opposed to the whole file. Applicants are expected to apply for several different categories of information. This will add completely unnecessary complications to the process. Perhaps the Minister will clarify why he is nodding his head. We need the process simplified to allow greater access to files, not unnecessary complications put in the way of adopted people that make it more difficult for adopted people when seeking their information. 	spk_250
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2022-01-20	dail	33	National Maternity Hospital: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_40	I commend the Independent Group on tabling this motion. The ownership and governance of the new national maternity hospital are issues of national importance. They are also of great local interest to the community in Dublin Bay South. For decades the National Maternity Hospital has been based in Holles Street, in the heart of inner city Dublin. The local community has an enormous sense of connection to the hospital. Many in the community took their first breath in that hospital, and I am one of them. A large number of people from the community either work there or have members of their family working there. From talking to these people I have heard first-hand accounts of the difficulties staff are facing. It is a very tight site in which they are trying to run a big operation.There is an urgent need for a new and more modern building to give staff and mothers the support they need. The new national maternity hospital will be based not far from Holles Street on the Elm Park campus of St. Vincent's University Hospital. This new maternity hospital will be a costly investment for the State and see the provision of state-of-the-art equipment and a much-needed modernised building. However, this process cannot be rushed through and we must ensure this large-scale State investment is protected from outside interference. The best safeguard of all is to ensure the full public ownership of this new maternity hospital. There are many people deeply concerned about potential interference by religious orders at this new maternity hospital. Concerns that the governance and religious ethos of St. Vincent's could limit the procedures at the new site are understandable. Safeguards must be put in place to ensure patients can freely access the treatments they require. The possibility that organisations separate to the State might interfere to prevent certain treatments cannot be allowed. The State must guarantee that any lawful service the hospital is expected to provide will not be restricted on any non-medical grounds, and the best guarantee of all would be full public ownership of the new national maternity hospital.	spk_339
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-12-16	dail	33	Covid-19: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_36	There is no part of Irish society that has not been impacted by this pandemic. Unfortunately, the response to the different sectors has been far from fair and equal, particularly in the sporting community. The rules and regulations on a return to sport during this pandemic have seldom been seen to treat all sports equally. We saw it last month with the sudden decision to allow only vaccinated children aged between 12 and 17 years to play indoor sports. This decision caused much pressure and stress on coaches and volunteers across the State and they turned children away from training and matches. Thankfully, the Minister eventually saw sense, engaged with stakeholders and rescinded the decision. On Monday, I was delighted to see a major investment in sport of nearly €80 million to help sporting organisations recover from the impact of the pandemic. However, once we dig into the figures, we cannot help but feel a sense of disappointment and unfairness because there is an ever-growing gap for sporting organisations beyond the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI, which are being treated particularly generously compared to smaller sports. The vast majority of sporting organisations are being treated like an afterthought when it comes to funding. For example, Basketball Ireland, a sporting organisation with a higher than average level of female participation, certainly significantly better than rugby, and an organisation with over 250 clubs spread right across the island, received just slightly over €1 million in the funding announced on Monday. While this funding is to be welcomed, and I am sure it will make use of every cent, that funding pales in comparison with what the IRFU will receive. The IRFU has about 50 clubs across the island and whole chunks of the island have no rugby clubs present at all, yet it will receive 17 times the funding that Basketball Ireland receives. We have to ask where is the logic in this. The funding allocation gives the impression that rugby is 17 times more popular than basketball but club numbers do not reflect this. We need to see funding that reflects sporting participation, not funding based on who can lobby the best. We need a sports facilities strategy and we need to see fair play in Irish sports funding.	spk_250
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-12-14	dail	33	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_19	A couple of weeks ago in the Dáil, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said he believed it was not best for Ireland to act unilaterally in support of Palestine against Israeli abuse and terror inflicted on the Palestinians. He said he believed Ireland should work with Europe as a unit to try to deliver a two-state solution. That would all be credible if Ireland influenced other European leaders; unfortunately, we do not. We are takers, not influencers, of European policy. We seem to be passive observers in Europe. Yes, the Government states how serious the situation is, but nothing ever follows through with action. If the Government wants to influence policy, why does it not take action? One course of action would be to approach like-minded countries to publish a collective statement of EU member states denouncing the designation of six Palestinian human rights groups as terrorist organisations and calling on the Israeli Minister of Defense to rescind the designation. That is not a lot to ask for. What is being done at Union level to protect EU funding of Palestinian human rights NGOs? Three NGOs have had their funding suspended by the EU as a precautionary measure based on the 74-page document of evidence for May that was widely condemned by member states as not substantiated. What is the Government doing to revoke immediately these precautionary measures on Palestinian funding? Where is the action? When will the Government put aside the kind words? People in Europe love us; of course they do because we are not being active, not delivering on change and not taking action. They are happy with us. We need action. We need to support Palestine and we need to make our support clear to the EU.	spk_216
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-12-08	dail	33	Housing Schemes	dbsect_3	I thank the Minister of State for facilitating this important matter. In 2004, 62 apartments were part of an affordable housing scheme at Poolbeg Quay, at the end of Sean Moore Road in Ringsend. There was huge excitement for those who got apartments and disappointment for those who did not.In 2004, these affordable homes - two-bed apartments - cost, on average, €146,000. The residents bought them in the belief they would be of a high quality. It was not unreasonable for people to think, when they invested so much money and got mortgages, that checks would have been carried out in order that they would have homes fit to live in for many decades. People expect their homes to be built properly. People do not expect their homes to be hazardous and defective just 17 years after being built. Surely, it cannot be the residents' fault for not detecting these defects. One would imagine the arms of the State and the big business involved would not allow this to happen. We must ask ourselves how have we reached a situation whereby ordinary families, such as the residents of Poolbeg Quay, Ringsend, have to pick up the tab for what seems to have been a systemic failure. Most people assume that banks or mortgage suppliers will carry out checks. There is an assumption that they will ensure that everything is done correctly so that a building is good for living in. Some 59 of the residents have their mortgages with Dublin City Council. Three have sold their apartments and paid the clawback amount. Some 17 years after they were built, there is serious damage to these apartments. There is major water ingress into the apartments, which are in serious need of repair. The roofs are in a dangerous condition. Recent quotes the residents got estimate that it will cost €250,000 to fix them. That is €250,000 which the residents do not have. If the residents were unable to pay their mortgages, it would be an issue for Dublin City Council because the mortgages are with the council. The residents are in a 20-year clawback arrangement with the council. This matter has everything to do with Dublin City Council, which cannot be allowed to wash its hands of this matter. Dublin City Council should have carried out building inspections. Given the fact that the council was facilitating loans, it had a responsibility to ensure that the apartments were built to certain standards. Proper inspections should have been carried out. The council should also have inspected the apartments as part of its building controls. The council signed off on these apartments in the context of the loans issued. The builder is deceased. However, the builder's companies cannot be allowed to walk away. I have been contacted by residents of Poolbeg Quay who are devastated by this turn of events. The big worry is that it will turn into another Priory Hall. We cannot leave people out to dry because others failed them. Will the Minister of State meet with the residents and listen to their stories? When he hears the details, I know he will support them. They need the support of the State, be that through the council or a direct scheme. I urge him not to forget the residents and not to turn his back on them. I ask that he meet with and listen to them.	spk_16

That is what is happening here. The residents have significant mortgages. The worry of paying this back, while also trying to fix the significant defects, is massive. The people who got mortgages and invested in these properties did not expect that, after 17 years, some of their homes would not be capable of being lived in. The latter is going to be the case shortly unless repairs are carried out. It is vital that those repairs be done. I urge the Minister and the Minister of State to meet the residents. They are very reasonable, but they are in a difficult position. All they are looking for is fair play and support. Dublin City Council is trying to wash its hands of the matter. That cannot be allowed to happen. We do not want another Priory Hall. We want the residents of Poolbeg Quay, Ringsend, to be treated fairly.

Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-12-07	dail	33	Dublin Fire Brigade: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_19	I thank my colleague, Deputy Paul Donnelly, for bringing forward this motion to the Dáil. I commend the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade on their commitment and bravery in carrying out their work. When one looks out the window today, it is notable that most people are indoors, but the fire services are the people we call on if there is any trouble or concern for us or our families. I particularly thank the members of the Dublin Fire Brigade stations in Donnybrook and Tara Street which operate across Dublin Bay South. Not only are they an emergency service and fire brigade stations, they are an integral part of the community. They are involved in events held by the community and they regularly engage in fundraising for a range of charities.  Dublin Fire Brigade provides immediate medical assistance 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It has had such a profound impact on countless lives across the city and beyond. In many cases, these firefighters put their own lives at risk while carrying out this invaluable work. It cannot be said often enough how indebted we in this city are to the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade, but words in support and praise are not nearly enough. A round of applause will not help. The Dublin Fire Brigade is in need of urgent support. That is what this motion brought forward by Deputy Paul Donnelly intends to deliver. We are hearing near constant reports of increased pressure owing to staff shortages. There is huge concern with regard to a lack of equipment and resources. Dublin Fire Brigade has saved countless lives in this city. In times of crisis elsewhere in this country, it has gone wherever it was needed. A first responder should never be put under this type of pressure. The men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade are the backbone of the emergency response in Dublin. They should never have to ballot for industrial action owing to staff shortages and concerns that the safety of firefighters and members of the public is being compromised.  We frequently hear reports of fire engines being off the road due to staff shortages. During last Hallowe'en, one of the busiest periods of the year for Dublin Fire Brigade, there were five engines off the road owing to staff shortages. We need to see back-to-back recruitment classes scheduled immediately and supports put in place to bring this lack of emergency cover to an end.We need to provide the Dublin Fire Brigade with the equipment and resources needed to carry out its job to the fullest of its members' ability. Dublin's fire brigade service is its first and last line of defence and it needs to be better resourced. I call on all parties to support this motion and give the Dublin Fire Brigade the support it deserves.	spk_261
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-12-02	dail	33	Child Abuse	dbsect_53	I thank the Acting Chairman for staying to this hour. I appreciate it. I also thank the Minister for coming in at this hour and giving me the opportunity to discuss this very important matter. Most people will be well aware of the work St. John Ambulance does and the services it provides. We are all used to seeing its presence at a wide range of sporting events including GAA, soccer and rugby games, in the RDS and at various community events. The vast majority of people who are well used to seeing St. John Ambulance personnel will not be aware of the dark history of the organisation or of the dark influences that seem to linger within it. I am speaking of the child and adult sexual abuse carried out over a number of years by senior members of the organisation.I commend the bravery of three survivors, Mick Finnegan, Paul Mulholland and Martin Hoey, who have spoken out publicly of the horrific sexual abuse they experienced when they were members of the organisation. Mick Finnegan was only 14 or 15 when the abuse started. Some of his testimony is harrowing, distressing and sickening. Since this independent review into historical child sex abuse within St. John Ambulance began, the leadership of that organisation has effectively refused to take part in this review. It is nine months since the review began and I have been informed that St. John Ambulance has provided no material to Dr. Geoffrey Shannon to aid his review. Mick Finnegan recently met Dr. Shannon and showed him some documents that he had from the St. John Ambulance and this was the first time that Dr. Shannon had seen documentation from the organisation. St. John Ambulance is effectively stonewalling the review process. I have a deep concern that the organisation is closing ranks to protect rapists and sexual abusers who may still be active members of St. John Ambulance. Every week St. John Ambulance continues to provide medical support to sporting and community events throughout the country. We cannot be passive observers of an organisation with a history of sexual abuse that refuses to comply with a review into that abuse. If St. John Ambulance were serious about this process, it would be more active in engaging with the process. It would be writing to older members, which it has not; it would be putting out public notices, which it has not; and it would be using its social media platforms to look for more information, which it has not. No real action has been taken against any organisation like St. John Ambulance. We need action. We need the Minister to push it to ensure it engages in a meaningful way because clearly it has not. An organisation that has closed ranks and has not engaged with the review into sexual abuse is providing medical support to sporting and community events every week. I ask the Minister to address this as a matter of urgency to ensure that those who have carried out these horrific sexual abuses are held to account. Those who remain silent in the full knowledge that senior members of St. John Ambulance were doing what they were doing need to be held to account.	spk_339

The difficulty is that Dr. Shannon has had no contact from St. John Ambulance. Its representatives talk about engaging in the process but they do not actually do it. If organisations with a clear history of sexual abuse refuse to co-operate with reviews and investigations into these crimes, we need more than speeches and words; we need action with sanctions imposed. We need firm action to force their hand to engage with the relevant reviews and investigations. While not directly, St. John Ambulance is receiving thousands of euro of State money every year through various sporting national governing bodies and community groups to which the State provides funds. It does not sit well with me to know that State funds are ending up in an organisation that has closed ranks in the face of a review into sex abuse. It is deeply concerning that some of those in senior leadership positions in St. John Ambulance knew of these abuses when they were being committed. Even more disturbingly, at that time these same people made jokes and even had songs about these horrific crimes of abuse being carried out. This culture of tolerance of abuse needs to be rooted out. Survivors of sexual abuse should not have to face such barriers in their pursuit of justice. The State should be providing these survivors with the support and resources they need to get that justice. I call on the Minister to take decisive action if St. John Ambulance continues to stonewall this review into child sex abuse. I go so far as to ask him to instruct sporting and community groups to withdraw from using St. John Ambulance at events until this review is carried out in the correct manner. I also appeal directly to sports organisations not to use St. John Ambulance at events they are holding until there is compliance with this review.	spk_341

There has been and continues to be much abuse by Israel on the Palestinian people. Among those abuses, which the Minister probably saw at first hand when he was over there on his recent visit, are the illegal settlements that no one can stop, the blockade of Gaza that no one can stop, apartheid Israel's systematic violation of children's rights, the shooting dead of countless children and the illegal administrative detention process. Hisham Abu Hawash has been jailed without charge since October 2020. He has been on hunger strike for 104 days. Nidal Ballout is 27 years of age and has been on hunger strike for 31 days. He is also being held under administrative detention. It is important that the Irish Government and the EU intervene on behalf of these individuals. I wish to ask a question specifically about the designation by apartheid Israel of the six Palestinian advocacy groups as terror groups. My understanding is that the six organisations have now been listed on the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel. This shows that Israel is starting to act on the designation orders. Also, the Israeli military commander communicated to the organisations two days ago, on 28 November, that they must cease work during the appeal process. This means that the work and funding of the organisations are under direct and immediate threat. What is Ireland doing, along with the other EU states, to pressure Israel and the Defense Minister of Israel to rescind the designation? Welcome back, a Cheann Comhairle. It is good to see you in good health.	spk_283
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-11-25	dail	33	Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_32	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. As a Deputy for Dublin Bay South, I have seen first-hand the terrible impact the SHD legislation has brought to local communities. Thousands of build-to-rent apartments and co-living units have been developed across the city with little or no regard for affordability or integration into the local community. They are just another cash cow for international vulture and cuckoo funds. Affordability, community and sustainability could not be further from their minds. I welcome that the Government has finally decided it is scrapping SHD legislation. We must be clear about the realities of the SHD process. It is deeply undemocratic. It has provided a method to bypass democratically agreed city and county development plans. It has reduced public participation and led to an increase in legal challenges. It is a throwback to the developer-led planning days of the Celtic tiger. At the time of the introduction of SHDs, Sinn Féin warned the Government against the process and proposed an alternative but it refused to listen. Sinn Féin was criticised for opposing what we were told was the way to deliver housing quickly. How wrong that assertion turned out to be. It is a shame it has taken this long for the negative effects of SHDs to be recognised by the Government parties and their supporters. Recently, one SHD has been given the green light to fast-track plans for 112 apartments, of which 56 will be one-bedroom and 56 two-bedroom apartments, in Irishtown, Dublin 4. They are going to be shoehorned into a very small site. The scheme results in the introduction of a six-storey development in an area defined by two and three-storey houses. The indicative prices are €540,000 for a two-bedroom apartment and €400,000 for a one-bedroom apartment. I do not know many people who can afford those prices. They will probably be bought by some highly paid executives in the big high-tech companies the Government has welcomed into the country. Not many ordinary working families in Ringsend or Pearse Street will be able to afford them, that is for sure. Where do these families go when they are pushed out? They end up moving to the outskirts of the city or beyond. This breaks up the community and dislocates families. Residents of Ringsend, Pearse Street and Irishtown are very proud of their community, and why would they not be? They have built an amazingly strong community. Unfortunately, Government policies do not support the community. They support the big tech companies and vulture funds. In the inner city the residents face serious challenges. The Government invites in the likes of Facebook, Google and Amazon, tech companies whose establishment pushes up the price of homes, putting them out of the reach of working people. It is great to have all the new jobs, absolutely, although very few of the middle and upper management jobs will go to the local community. I acknowledge that Google is working on community engagement but the other companies are not even making an effort to support and engage with the local community. On top of these high-tech companies pushing up the price of homes for the community, Government policies are supporting the vulture funds, which also squeeze residents and push up the cost of homes to rent and buy. Residents in Pearse Street, Ringsend and right across the inner city are being squeezed by Government policies. Sinn Féin would make the likes of Amazon and the other high-tech companies and vulture funds pay their share and give residents in Pearse Street and Ringsend a break. The expense of the sites and apartments means the Part V public housing allocation will not be on site and often will not be in the community. The Part V homes must be delivered in the community.The legislation needs to be changed to ensure Part V homes are delivered, at the very least, in the community. The most high-profile example of Part V homes not being delivered locally concerns Capital Dock. The Part V homes that were to be there were delivered in Mount Argus. Although this is great for the Mount Argus community, it is not the way it should be. Residents in Ringsend and Irishtown have to put up with the disruption from building works. They are happy to do that, but the least they should have is something positive out of this and homes for their children. That is not unreasonable to expect. We need to see housing developments that are well planned for effective integration into the community. We need to see good-quality, genuinely affordable homes that are designed with families and long-term tenants in mind. We need residents to shop locally and use local sports clubs. We need housing developments to be places where communities can grow and develop. It is our town too, and we have to develop a city that reflects the needs of the community. While this Bill is a step in the right direction, there are several concerns and shortcomings – one being that there is no provision in it for public participation at pre-planning stage. The input of the local community must be a cornerstone of any policy on planning. Developers can talk to the planners, which is understandable and right; but equally, residents must have access to planners. It needs to be easier for residents to access planners. Residents need to be given the tools to engage with planners because trying to understand the planning process can be extremely difficult. Residents need support in this regard, and the playing field needs to be levelled. The local community must be given an avenue for its voice to be heard. Time and again, we have all seen where a lack of meaningful consultation with the local community led to tension and hostility to change. That is understandable. Ninety percent of the judicial reviews of SHD planning applications involve material that violates the city and county development plans. How is it that we allow SHDs to override our local development plans? Local development plans are put together by councillors and council management with the best interest of communities in mind. The plans are then democratically agreed upon. We cannot continue down the path of eroding more and more local government power. In that regard, this LRD legislation is a good step in the right direction. Local development plans must be in line with the national development plan. They are reviewed by the planning regulator to ensure they are all in line. Therefore, there is no reason that future cases should involve material that violates local development plans. We are also concerned that when it comes to local authorities making planning decisions, there should be no restriction on local authorities seeking additional information. If they need more information to make a sound planning decision, there should be no obstruction. We need to be providing local authorities with the support and resources to make the best planning decisions possible, not putting obstacles to finding additional information in their way. We have strong concerns over the lack of clarity regarding the leapfrog provision set out in section 6 of the Bill. We need clarity from the Minister on the reasoning for its inclusion. It strikes me that the provision has nothing to do with residential developments; rather, it is being inserted for the benefit of large infrastructure projects. Therefore, we must ask why the provision is in the Bill. I also have strong concerns over the transitional arrangements set out in section 17. This section effectively extends the SHD provisions into next year, and possibly beyond if there are any legal challenges. If applications already in the pre-planning process are approved to proceed to the full planning stage before 17 December, when the replacement legislation is due to be enacted, developers will have up to April to apply. Some applications will remain in the circumstances I describe until October, with the possibility of legal action late in 2022, and possibly 2023. This is nothing new. When we consider the delay in the introduction of planning restrictions on co-living developments, we see developers have now been provided with ample opportunity, long after the expiry of the SHD legislation, to benefit from it. Section 17 effectively extends the SHD provisions into next year, and possibly beyond if there are legal challenges. While we support this legislation, we will be raising concerns on Committee Stage.	spk_253
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-11-25	dail	33	Mother and Baby Institutions: Statements	dbsect_35	I acknowledge the dreadful experience of the survivors and extend my sympathies to them. I thank them for the messages they sent to all of us over the past several months and years. The response of the State to those who suffered such immense brutality at the hands of the church has been nothing short of a national disgrace. Sadly, this seems to be the way that successive Governments have treated survivors. Earlier today, members of the Irish Thalidomide Association were outside the gates of Leinster House marking 60 years since the international withdrawal of thalidomide. The Government continues to fight thalidomide survivors in the courts and denies them the justice they deserve. Thalidomide survivors are another group abandoned by successive Governments in their pursuit of justice, but they fight on seeking the apology, justice and fairness they deserve from the State. The horrific details of the abuses carried out by the church on behalf of the State within the mother and baby homes seem to know no limit or end. They relate to a truly horrific, dark and shameful part of Ireland’s history. However, to thousands upon thousands of people across this State and further afield, it is far from history. They continue to live with the pain and suffering they experienced in the institutions. They live with the pain of not knowing and wondering what happened to their loved ones who were so cruelly ripped from their arms. The constant delays and barriers in the way of the survivors must be removed. The State should be providing the survivors of mother and baby homes and their families with every resource possible for them to get the justice they deserve. It is shameful that the Government’s proposals are excluding the children who were boarded out. In so many cases, these children were treated like slaves, and so many experienced sexual abuse. The creation of a hierarchy of abuse by the State scheme is wrong. It adds to the suffering of those who have suffered enough. Excluding children who were boarded out and children who spent less than six months in the appalling institutions is simply the Government telling these survivors that their abuse and suffering just do not count. I strongly urge the Minister to include those who were in homes for less than six months. Their treatment is just compounding the injustice and unfairness. I acknowledge that the Minister did go further than the commission, which must be welcomed. I, like others, seek an interim payment for older survivors. I cannot see why this cannot be made. I urge the Minister to fast-track it.	spk_330

Separate to the redress scheme for people who own homes affected by mica, there is a working group within the environment Department that examines defects in housing. Poolbeg Quay residents in Ringsend, who are all mortgage holders through Dublin City Council, have homes with serious defects. There are 62 homes there and this would take significant financial resources to fix. Residents did not create the defects. This is stressful for residents and affects their mental health. It is a desperate situation and the residents desperately need support. Can the Taoiseach say when this working group will issue findings and give some relief to the residents of Poolbeg Quay?	spk_78

We hear of all the rhetoric and talk from Government of a just transition for our communities, grants and supports for retrofitting of homes and for electric cars. However, that is all it is to most people - it is talk. How can the average family afford a €40,000 to €60,000 retrofit of their family homes, while the cost of living continues to rise? On top of that, we are now being told that local sports clubs are to have the primary grant for retrofitting of lighting pulled from 2022 onwards. What kind of message are we sending to sports groups and organisations which want to do the right thing? The message is clear that they are on their own and should not expect anything from Government. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant has been a vital resource for local not-for-profit sports clubs which want to move to a more environmentally-friendly source of lighting. One GAA club alone has estimated an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of 30 tonnes. Modernising two LED floodlights can cost a sports club up to €80,000. I struggle to understand how this Government thinks not-for-profit community sports clubs have upwards of €80,000 in their accounts for such works. We need to provide community organisations the supports for a just transition at a grassroots level and not put barriers in their way. We continue to see Irish coastal communities being failed by this Government. Raw sewage is flowing into the swimming areas on a frequent basis. It may be late November, but if one heads down to the Half Moon at Poolbeg lighthouse in Sandymount, one will see that people swim there all year round now, as they do at the Forty Foot in Sandycove. However, in the eyes of officialdom, official bathing stops in November. Why has the bathing season not been updated to reflect the reality that thousands of people are swimming throughout the year? The Minister of State has the power to amend the bathing water quality regulations with the stroke of a pen. I ask the Minister of State to amend these bathing regulations and start to give coastal communities the support they deserve.	spk_153

We hear a lot of sound bites about the 15-minute city. That sounds great in theory but the reality is very different. As the Minister knows, you will not get up the Seán Moore Road in 15 minutes. Residents living in the new houses in Ringsend, as well as in homes in Irishtown and Sandymount, are already living in a car park, with traffic almost stationary for large parts of the day. The Government wants to kick the Luas out for another ten or 20 years. If the Government is serious about integrated transport and reducing cars on the road, it needs to offer alternatives. How can the Minister stand over the delay of ten years, and possibly more, for the Poolbeg Luas?	spk_294
Chris Andrews	46	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-11-18	dail	33	Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_32	I thank the Leas-Chean Comhairle. I welcome this Bill and the regulation of e-scooters. It is really important. We need some kind of structure and guidelines for users of e-scooters. The public is ahead of Government on this. Travelling through Dublin city, people are on scooters every day. They have decided they are using scooters so it is important Government regulates them and legislates for their use. I have seen presentations from some companies in this area. There are big, glossy leaflets and the companies are making commitments and saying how much is in their bank balances. It is important that when these companies come to Ireland, they are not allowed to cherry-pick. They must commit to delivering nationwide and not just for Dublin. It was said to me that if one of these companies does not get Dublin, they will probably just leave the market. They will have no interest in the rest of the country. They have no intention of going to Limerick, Galway or Waterford. It is important the local authorities work together and ensure the companies are not allowed do that. They must commit to this project and ensure they deliver a service in all the urban settings across the country. The NCBI, the Irish Wheelchair Association and Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind recently issued a paper outlining their concerns. They identified the parking of e-scooters as an issue. That will be a huge challenge. Deputy Hourigan mentioned it earlier. She spoke much more eloquently than me. This is going to be a key make-or-break part of the project. If the parking methodology is not done right it will not work. It is very important the e-scooters are not allowed to become trip hazards and obstacles for those with disabilities. Navigating the city can be challenging enough for visually impaired people without also throwing a load of scooters all over the city. Last October, Copenhagen made the decision to ban e-scooters from its streets after disabilities groups voiced concern. That came into effect in January. Copenhagen is a city that is open to different modes of transport and e-mobility, yet it has decided to knock this on the head. Thus there is a concern here. There is a view scooters are great, that they are exciting and that they are going to offer a great alternative. However, there is evidence enough there to suggest that may not be the case and we must introduce them very carefully. Local authorities will have to introduce their schemes cautiously. Dockless scooters and possibly dockless bikes tend to face more vandalism. They have been thrown into rivers and canals in other cities where they were introduced.We know that in different cities there were issues with scooters and e-bikes all being thrown into various rivers, if there was no docking space. We do not want to see the River Liffey or the Grand Canal become a place for e-scooters and e-bikes. I understand that a company in Manchester faced so much vandalism, it decided it had to pull out of the scheme. It is important, when big companies come into the market promising the sun, moon and stars, that local authorities are not overly dazzled by the size of some of them. As I said, I have attended a few presentations, and it all sounds fantastic and looks as if every angle has been covered, but the reality is international evidence suggests that sharing schemes may not work here. That is something local authorities will have to take on and do so very carefully because it is important that these companies have a strong local connection. Many of these big companies will tender for various contracts to deliver the e-mobility schemes across the cities, but if they do not have a local connection it will impact on how they deliver the service and how they respond to difficulties that may arise with the scheme.  I strongly agree that e-scooters should not be allowed on footpaths. This legislation will not allow that to happen. Footpaths should be safe from e-scooters because it can be very frightening for older people to see someone on a scooter flying towards them. They are also concerned that if they go around a corner they will get knocked over by a scooter that is going at 15 km/h or 20 km/h on a footpath. It is very dangerous. Many older people have said to me that they do not have any serious objection to e-scooters, but they are nervous about the idea of scooters on footpaths, breaking traffic lights and so on. There has to be regulation and a system of fines in place to ensure there is a consequence if the rules are not adhered to. There must be fines for those on e-scooters who use footpaths. If they use footpaths, they have to face the consequences because it is not acceptable, just as it is not acceptable that adults cycle bikes on footpaths. Some regulation has to be in order.  There are areas that should be geofenced from e-scooters. A previous speaker mentioned that shared space does not work and I fully agree with this. There are areas, for example, in Dublin city, that will have to be geofenced to ensure e-scooters cannot be used in those shared spaces. Grand Canal Dock is one such area that should not have e-scooters in it. I have received a number of reports about e-scooter users racing through Grand Canal Dock, taking a shortcut or looking to fly through it, causing accidents, worrying residents living there and people who are just walking around enjoying the atmosphere. Sharing that space is not going to work with a scooter travelling at 15 km/h, 20 km/h or 25 km/h. It just will not work. Certain pedestrianised areas, such as Grafton Street and Grand Canal Dock, should be geofenced to ensure that e-scooters cannot fly up and down them. I have previously raised the issue of cyclists with Dublin City Council. Cyclists should not be allowed to use Grand Canal Dock either as there are such a large number of them and they cause a major amount of stress and injuries to residents and people socialising in the area. If we introduce scooters, it will become an area that will almost be not welcoming to pedestrians. E-scooters do not work in shared spaces and, in certain settings, neither do bicycles. We have to ensure that the new sharing scheme geofences certain areas so e-scooter users and cyclists are not allowed terrorise people in areas such as Grand Canal Dock. Adding e-scooters to that environment is of no benefit to anyone. It is not a huge area and people can move around the Grand Canal Dock area legally and safely, if that is what they wish to do. This legislation is important. I do not have an e-scooter but I think I will get one. I have no doubt the Acting Chairman would look great flying around on a e-scooter. When he gets too old for his motorbike, he might try an e-scooter. This legislation may not be as good as the hype is building it up to be, but there are many concerns. We have to take into consideration the views of the Irish Wheelchair Association, the NCBI and the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, which I mentioned earlier, and whose members made a very fair and open statement. We need to take their concerns into consideration because it is difficult enough to navigate the city without adding all these obstacles. Where e-scooters will be docked and parked will also be crucial and will make or break the plan.	spk_322
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-11-04	dail	33	Monitoring Adequate Housing in Ireland: Statements	dbsect_39	I welcome this opportunity for the Dáil to debate the findings of the IHREC report on adequate housing. Amid this ever-growing crisis within housing, the report highlights several key findings and challenges in housing that many of us have long suspected. I represent the constituency of Dublin Bay South, a constituency with a wealth of history and rich in community. At the core of so many of these communities are various council flat complexes in the inner city. From Ringsend right across to Kevin Street and down to Rathmines, these communities have contributed immensely to the very fabric that makes up Dublin city and they continue to do so. However, these communities have not been treated with the care and respect they deserve. The reality is these communities have been failed by a housing policy which neglects them year after year. I have on several occasions highlighted in the Dáil numerous examples of the harsh living conditions that tenants renting from the local authorities must endure, issues such as widespread dampness and mould in flats going untreated for long periods of time and widespread rat infestation across several flat complexes in the inner city. So bad are these infestations that some residents are even afraid to open their windows because the rats are nesting under their balconies. There is a flat complex in York Street built only 12 years ago and at the time it was an award-winning design. Now, it is infested with rats and is flooding so frequently that Dublin City Council has had to move several families to a nearby hotel. The realities of neglect and housing inadequacy run rampant across the inner city. I can give numerous examples of this neglect. We have heard strong words from the Government on its commitment to providing tenants with adequate social housing. We have heard the Government acknowledge that these complexes and communities are intrinsic to the city and have huge cultural and heritage significance. These living conditions are unacceptable, so the Government says. For residents in Pearse House, Glovers Court and Beech Hill Villas in Donnybrook, these words from Ministers mean nothing. These communities have had enough of talk and empty guarantees. They need urgent action in dealing with these harsh conditions. If Dublin City Council does not act, then the Minister and his Department must intervene. In the eyes of those living in many of the council flat complexes, they have been abandoned, forgotten and brushed aside by the Government. The cut of €23 million to State regeneration funding, despite unacceptable conditions of social housing in flat complexes, is to many yet another nail in the coffin of inner city communities.	spk_319
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-11-04	dail	33	Ambulance Service	dbsect_40	I thank the Ceann Comhairle. Two weeks ago on 19 October the Israeli defence minister formally designated human rights organisation Al-Haq and five other Palestinian human rights groups as terrorist organisations under Israeli law. The other five are Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, Bisan Center for Research and Development, Defense for Children International Palestine, the Union of Agricultural Work Committees and the Union of Palestinian Women's Committees. Let us be clear about this. This is about shutting down legitimate criticism of Israeli human rights abuses. Israel's charge against the six NGOs, which include groups that offer legal support to prisoners and a women's rights organisation, is based on a connection to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, PFLP. This claim has been made by apartheid Israel for many years and it is untrue. There is absolutely no evidence to back up the claim these organisations are involved in terrorism. For any state to be able to change policy in this way would suggest apartheid Israel is growing in confidence it can do what it wants. Apartheid Israel is becoming increasingly confident it can do what it wants and there will be no consequences for anything it does. Let us be clear apartheid Israel's actions are increasingly making a two-state solution less and less likely. The chance of a two-state solution is disappearing on Ireland's watch on the UN Security Council. I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney's additional €2.4 million allocation to fund UN bodies working in Palestine. However, to be brutally honest, it feels like guilt money because the Government is not willing to recognise the state of Palestine or even to pass the occupied territories Bill put forward by Senator Black. If we genuinely want to support Palestine we must make significant acts like recognising the state of Palestine and supporting the occupied territories Bill. We need concrete action on the six designated organisations and we need clarity. We need an official public statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that categorically denounces the terror designation and removes all deference to Israel. We need to send public messages to the Irish banks that Ireland does not recognise the terror designations and ensure the open exchange of transactions between Irish entities and the organisations and their staff members. This will have implications for Irish citizens and relations with Palestine and Palestinian advocacy groups. In light of the unprecedented attack against Palestinian civil society, Ireland must ensure increased funding to these six civil society organisations. It is important to state Al-Haq regards Jerusalem in its entirety as Palestinian as there is no recognition of the illegal acts of annexation in 1949 in west Jerusalem and in 1967 in east Jerusalem. It is equally important to note the Minister, Deputy Coveney, insinuated during his recent visit to apartheid Israel that Ireland might at some point recognise Israel's sovereignty over west Jerusalem and even consider moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

It is not dramatic action, but recognising the state of Palestine will send out a clear message, to Palestinians and to Israel, that Israeli actions are unacceptable. It is not a lot to ask yet all we do is raise the issue in the Chamber and express concern about it. That is no good to the Palestinian community and Israel knows that. Senator Frances Black's occupied territories Bill is very reasonable and fair and yet we are not willing to support it. We sacrificed that Bill to get our place on the UN Security Council, which is having no impact, in a positive way, on the Palestinian situation or giving the Palestinian community a little justice.	spk_334

As the Minister of State with responsibility for credit unions, he has done a great job listening to credit union representatives, but the time for listening is over.The time for kicking the can down the road is over and we need action. There are clear commitments in the programme for Government to support the credit unions. The Minister of State has been in government for 16 months now. We are still waiting for action. If he does not want Deputy Harkin’s Bill, then where is the Government’s Bill? Credit unions are delivering an important service to the local community in Ringsend, Crumlin, and Pearse Street. However, by 2030, some of the smaller credit unions will be gone, unless they get support from Government. If they go, this will have a significant impact on many people. Our banking system is effectively down to two and a half banks, which is the same number we had 20 years ago. The banks’ working model is to close branches. Post offices are closing. Donnybrook, for instance, has no post office. There is a need for credit unions, now more than ever. Many people to whom I speak, many of whom are on decent incomes, cannot get bank loans because they are financially powerless. Credit unions support this profile of person.

This is an ongoing process by Israel which aims to dismantle all community structures that highlight the nature of apartheid Israel. We must stand with the six organisations. If organisations are going to be treated like this, young people will be driven into armed resistance. That is the reality, and who could blame them? Ireland's position on the UN Security Council is about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike. It has made no difference to the Palestinian community. We get loads of words from this Government, but no action. There must be action. The Government must act and tell apartheid Israel that what it is doing is unacceptable.

Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-10-21	dail	33	Breast Cancer Awareness Month: Statements	dbsect_36	This October marks the 36th annual breast cancer awareness month. Like previous speakers, I acknowledge all of the staff who work in the cancer screening programmes. They carry out their work with huge empathy, care and professionalism and I acknowledge this. When breast cancer awareness month was first launched, the message was simply to promote breast screening throughout the population as one of the most effective weapons in the fight against breast cancer. Screening has proven to be instrumental in the early detection of breast cancer. It has also been proven to lower the numbers of women dying from breast cancer. Each year, approximately 3,500 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed. One in nine women will develop breast cancer during their lifetime. This is a stark and concerning statistic. It is something that highlights the need to carry out the screening programme and breast cancer treatment. A total of 1 million cancer screenings have not taken place across Europe since March 2020. Screening not taking place can lead to later stage diagnosis which most likely will have worse outcomes. The challenge is to increase the number of screenings. Thanks to increased awareness of breast screening, survival rates are on the rise and mortality rates are decreasing. It is important to acknowledge this. There are many amazing charities, such as the Marie Keating Foundation and Breast Cancer Ireland, that do incredible work in promoting awareness of breast screening and providing support for those receiving treatment. Recently, a close friend of mine, Gemma Devoy from Leo Fitzgerald House, began treatment for breast cancer. Gemma is just 35 years of age. I know there is science around it, but for me this highlights that the screening age needs to be lowered. On hearing of the financial difficulties faced by women receiving treatment, Gemma set herself the task of raising €1,500 for the Marie Keating Foundation to help other women like herself getting treatment. As a true reflection of the strong inner-city community she comes from, the community rallied behind her and her cause. There were events such as bingo and more than €20,000 was raised. While it is a stressful time, there are also many positives that can come out of it.	spk_310
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-10-21	dail	33	Covid-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing our Recovery and Reconnecting: Statements	dbsect_37	There is one issue I wish to raise that is affecting sporting communities and that is the continued confusion around the use of clubs' dressing rooms and showers. Last month, from 20 September, dressing rooms were due to be reopened across the board following guidelines from Sport Ireland, yet in late October, with the cold and dark evenings well and truly set in, a number of dressing rooms and changing rooms across the country remain shut and there is a lot of confusion. I have heard reports of different sporting national governing bodies, NGBs, having conflicting policies on changing rooms, despite using the same changing rooms. There is a multi-use facility whereby one code will allow use of the changing rooms and one will not. We cannot have one rule for one sport and a separate rule for another sport. It makes no sense at all, and guidance on this needs to be given. We need clarity and sporting groups need clarity. We cannot continue to have teams changing in car parks in the cold and wet winter months ahead. Strong communication and leadership from Sport Ireland and its affiliated governing bodies could put an end to this. Another issue of concern to clubs around the country is that of volunteers. We need to have a plan from Sport Ireland for the engagement and re-engagement with sporting volunteers across the country. As everyone out there involved in local sports knows, volunteers are the backbone of youth sports and adult sports and are the lifeline of every club in the country. The past 18 months have been very tough on those volunteering within local clubs. Clubs across my constituency - I am sure this is a national trend - are finding it hard to attract and maintain a network of volunteers due to additional pressures from this pandemic. That needs to be taken into account and we cannot afford to have volunteers drifting off. Sport Ireland needs to be proactive on this.	spk_329
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-10-20	dail	33	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_17	I note that a number of items are on the agenda for the upcoming European Council meeting ranging from rising energy costs to migration, external relations and foreign policy issues. In this State, we have seen more than 30 energy price hikes announced by Irish energy suppliers since the start of the year. These sharp increases in the cost of energy are adding to increasing costs of living and having a severe impact on people across the State, from students and workers to pensioners. The ESB provided safe and secure electricity generation to every corner and community in this State. For many years, our energy prices were among the lowest in EU until the ESB had to set prices higher to encourage competition in the market. As a result, electricity prices here have gone from being among the lowest to now being among the highest in the EU. Once again, the market has failed to provide lower and more competitive prices for consumers. We have already seen several EU member states such as France, Italy and Spain taking decisive action to reduce the burden of these price hikes on ordinary people. Notably in Spain, consumers will see their average monthly bill drop by 22%. Therefore, it can be done. Previous governments were happy to drive up energy prices to encourage competition in the energy sector. We now need this Government to step up to the plate and follow the lead of other EU member states to put a halt to these runaway energy prices and take some of the burden off ordinary people. I will raise one particular issue of concern with regard to international relations and issues of foreign policy. Four days ago, German war planes flew over Jerusalem, Ramallah and the occupied Palestinian territories, undoubtedly terrifying countless people beneath them. On behalf of my friends who are living in occupied territories, I would like it made clear to European Council members such as Germany, Italy, Greece and France that the racist terror state of Israel does not have the sovereign right to host its military air shows over the occupied territories. These military incursions are wrong. They show absolute contempt and are unnecessary. Most of all, however, they are illegal. We need, therefore, to make our voice heard and say this display of force and power is not acceptable. Will the German jets join Israeli jets in bombing Gaza families? Is that what will happen next? This sort of behaviour is an act of aggression dressed up as an air show. The reality is that it is a show of power. I ask that other EU member states such as Italy, Greece and France, which are taking part in this air show with the Israeli Air Force, need to respect Palestinian airspace and not violate it like the German Luftwaffe has done. Germany is effectively rubber-stamping Israeli terror. This is an act of solidarity by Germany, France, Greece and Italy with the racist apartheid state of Israel.	spk_313
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-10-19	dail	33	Rental Sector: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	I commend my colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, on his motion on renters. I also congratulate him and thank him for the work he does advocating for a better, fairer and more just approach to housing. I represent the constituency of Dublin Bay South, which stands as a prime example of how housing policies developed by Government parties have continually failed the needs of these communities. Government parties have stood idly by while Dublin City Council flat complexes have been allowed fall into disrepair and neglect. It is important to remember that those people are renters also. Issues like dampness, mould, frequent flooding and rat infestation are all common within the State's housing stock in the inner city. These tenants across the inner city, who pay rent to Dublin City Council, have effectively been abandoned by this Government. Let us dispel the myth that many pundits and those in the media like to fire out so often about social housing being free. These residents pay rent. They contribute to society and keep alive that strong sense of inner city community that makes Dublin what it is. Not only has this Government failed those renting from local authorities, it has also left many of those renting in the private sector to the mercy of institutional landlords who are trying to squeeze every cent out of ordinary working people and send it to their shareholders, many of whom have probably not set foot in Ireland. Too often we see landlords who will put two bunk beds in one double room and charge sky-high rents per bed with little or no regard for the quality of life of those who need somewhere to call home. For these reasons, we need the measures outlined in this motion, such as the NCT-style certification for all rental properties to ensure compliance with minimum standards. There were zero changes for renters in the budget and no changes to HAP limits at a time of runaway rents. We need to give renters a break and support this motion.	spk_260
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-10-14	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 2: General (Resumed)	dbsect_22	Dublin city and county seem to be moving from one crisis to another with attempts by developers to turn this city into one big hotel, while killing off more and more of the city's character, whether it is Merchant's Arch or The Cobblestone, and a lack of sporting facilities being provided for those living in the city and calling it their home. Considering the height and density of new developments in this city there needs to be an increase in the 10% green and sporting space required in developments. We have seen the hardship that Ranelagh Gaels GAA has faced as it struggles to find adequate grounds for its club, which gives so much back to a wide range of people in the community. Government needs to empower and aid clubs such as Ranelagh Gaels GAA so they can find new and adequate spaces, not stand by and idly watch as they struggle. Large green sites such as the Jesuit grounds in Milltown, which are planned for development, represent another missed opportunity to incorporate sports facilities for the community.In Dublin Bay South, we have the cricket grounds on Claremont Road. Its gates are locked and the local club has been pushed from the grounds. People have spent more than 100 years playing on the grounds, but they will be sold off for more build-to-rent developments. People ask what Sinn Féin's proposals are. Last August, I published Sinn Féin's strategy for sporting facilities, which would allow for effective and long-term planning by the Government and local authorities to meet the need for facilities where it arises in future.

The Government has started waving the white flag. It feels to residents and me that the neglect will continue. The Government has turned its back on Dubliners living in flat complexes. I have consistently highlighted the shocking conditions that Dublin City Council residents have to live in due to that neglect. For me and the communities that I represent, the €23 million cut to State regeneration funding, despite the unacceptable conditions of older social housing and flat complexes, is devastating. Residents of flat complexes have been told by this Government that it is giving up on residents and that they can continue to live in the rat infestation, the flooding, dampness and decay. I am the first to hold Dublin City Council to account. However, the council cannot do the necessary work if it is not given the resources. The Government is using the council as a mudguard. This budget and the cuts to regeneration allocation highlight where responsibility lies. Residents know that it lies squarely on the lap of the Government. This budget shines a light on that. I recently got a list of 23 flat complexes that Dublin City Council planned to regenerate. With a cut to regeneration funding, the reality is that most people reading this list will not be alive by the time the council gets halfway down it. Sinn Féin sees the dire circumstances that residents in flat complexes live in. We allocated increased funding for flat regeneration in our alternative budget. We did this because we know that no Government could or should stand over the conditions that residents are expected to live in. I have said many times here that Dublin City Council should set up a pilot scheme to tackle the extreme rat infestation in the flats. More intense levels of baiting and tackling nests of rats are urgently needed. The council also needs to carry out a repair programme immediately to fix the drains. The drains are a source of rats. They harbour rats. They are old drains and they need to be fixed urgently. In 2017, a ruling was made by the European Committee of Social Rights that Ireland had breached Article 16 of the revised European Social Charter. The committee went on to say that the Irish State had failed to ensure the right to housing of an adequate standard for a not insignificant number of families. Four years on from this ruling, nothing has changed for the people living and paying rent in these State-owned homes and flats. Across the inner city, many flats are in a shocking condition. Tenants describe living there as a constant battle. Every day, they face a constant battle against the conditions inflicted on them by Dublin City Council, this Government and neglect.Why has the State not acted to amend its failings?

It is important to state the vast majority of the residents of the flats complexes are hard-working, involved, active participants in their community. A huge number of them were working on the front line during the pandemic. They are committed to their community. When someone is hurt, they get behind them and stand with them. The new York Street apartments are only 12 years old. One entire block was flooded during the week. There was a major flood and residents had to be moved out to a hotel across the road. The conditions are so bad, residents cannot be left there in the apartments. There are ongoing issues. Some windows cannot open and some cannot close. There are rats nesting under the balconies. These apartments are 12 years old. They are not old. Residents are living in fear. One woman had her flat flooded seven times in the last couple of years. She is terrified.  Dublin City Council's treatment of the residents can only be called neglect. Someone living in a private tenancy can bring the landlord to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and get some resolution to the various issues. Dublin City Council tenants have nowhere to go. The council is judge and jury. It is unfair and needs to be changed. I ask that the Department examine having an independent moderator or arbitrator where Dublin City Council tenants can be heard when there are issues like this.

This Bill has now lapsed. It was introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers. A couple of weeks ago, it was noted in the legislative programme for the 2021 autumn session that work is under way to ""provide a package of health and personal social services and other supports to survivors of thalidomide on a statutory basis"". Will the Minister of State outline the timeframe for the roll-out of this particular legislation? Will he also outline why the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has not met with representatives of the Irish Thalidomide Association? It seems extraordinary that the last two Ministers for Health and the current Minister have all failed to meet the thalidomide survivors. How can Ministers for Health not meet a group for which it is introducing legislation? The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, introduced the Bill I mentioned earlier in 2018 to support thalidomide survivors and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, supported it. Despite this, the Government has now turned its back on these survivors, of whom there are only 32. The Minister is on record as saying that the thalidomide survivors deserve compensation, recognition and justice. They are his words and yet he will not even meet them.  I am pretty certain that thalidomide survivors are going to hear the same speech from the Minister of State that they have heard for the last ten years. There are, as I mentioned, only 32 acknowledged survivors in Ireland. The vast majority of them turn 60 this year or next year. The Minister will hide behind solicitors and barristers and claim there cannot be a meeting for legal reasons. On that point, not all survivors are taking a legal case so why not meet them? Survivors have been in the courts with Government for the last eight years. The Government faces a bill of €24 million for its court action against survivors yet it will not engage with them. Does the Minister of State have even one sentence that will give thalidomide survivors hope? Will he show that there is some genuine commitment from this Government, because there has been no evidence of it so far?  More than 60 years after the thalidomide scandal in which morning sickness medicine for pregnant women caused malformations in their babies, survivors are still fighting for fair compensation in several European countries. I have met many survivors of thalidomide and I have been inspired by their stories, their resilience and their courage. Like all of us, thalidomide survivors are getting older and now require extra medical assistance and social care. They fear that their independence might be stripped from them. Thalidomide survivors must be respected and compensated. The British Government's £100 million compensation scheme stands in stark contrast to the unsatisfactory approach taken by our Irish Government.  It is long past time for the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to engage realistically with thalidomide survivors. The Government needs to bring forward a package that gives due acknowledgement to the victims of one of the greatest medical scandals. This package must guarantee the healthcare and personal needs of just 32 people who have to face later life with great uncertainty.

The people causing this ongoing trouble need to be tackled and challenged. We talk about rights, and it is important to remember that families have the right to live in their homes without fear. Garda resources need to be increased, particularly the number of community gardaí, who do a fantastic job. In the context of these statements, it is important to remember that the vast majority of people living in the inner city are hard-working and many have spent the past 19 months of the pandemic working on the front line. According to the strategy, research shows links between youth offending and socio-economic circumstances. This has been known for years and there have been many strategies, yet we have not diverted resources to where they are needed. Services are fragmented, as was accepted by the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, in his opening statement. An example of that fragmentation is the division of the north and south inner cities. They are one community - an inner-city docklands community - with more in common than separates them. The IFSC came into the north inner city and displaced a large section of the community. Today, high-tech companies like Facebook, Google and TikTok have arrived in the south inner city, displacing large sections of that community. The north inner city has had its challenges and resources have been directed towards its community under the umbrella of the Mulvey report. The south inner city needs and deserves the same process and resources that the Mulvey report secured for the north inner city. Another example of where services are fragmented is in the delivery of youth services. Talk About Youth is a great youth service covering the Pearse Street area, but it does not have a dedicated youth space. We can have all the plans and strategies we want, but if we do not get the basics right, they will not deliver change for young people in working class communities. We need to ensure that youth services like Talk About Youth have the basics and their own spaces. The strategy mentions early intervention, but I see little evidence of such intervention in my constituency. I see new parents struggling with parenting. That is where there needs to be intervention. I see children of ten or 11 years of age running drugs in the community. Working with families needs to be a priority. We need to develop assertive youth work teams that tackle and challenge hard-to-reach young people. This strategy is welcome, but unless we get the basics right, it will do nothing but gather cobwebs.	spk_191

This motion is of vital importance to society and will have a meaningful impact on the lives of a significant number of workers and their families. Year after year, the cost of childcare in Ireland is among the highest in the world. These sky-high prices are having a huge impact on young families and add stress, concern and worry. Moreover, on top of the high cost of childcare, families are seeing rents skyrocket. The chances of them becoming homeowners is diminishing and household bills are rising sharply. We now live in a society in which those who wish to have children are being severely penalised as a result. Let us not forget that having children is necessary for the development of a healthy society. In Dublin, the cost of childcare for just one child is upwards of €1,000 per month, with many parents struggling to even find a place available to them. This enormous cost is not just having a detrimental impact on working families; it is also having a disproportionately negative impact on women and is preventing thousands of women from returning to employment and is reinforcing gender inequality. Affordable childcare is not just an economic necessity, it is vital for improving the quality of life of working families, for getting people back into the workforce and for fostering a healthy development of society. Let us be clear that childcare needs to be affordable and accessible locally in the community. Community childcare such as that in the Ringsend community centre and St. Andrew's Resource Centre is what we need, namely, childcare rooted in the community. Childcare is not just where one sends children for a few hours while their parents are out working. It is a place that is key to the development and growth of each child in respect of how to learn and how to interact with other children. That is a very important part of their formative years and it is vital it is done right. Thankfully, those working in Irish childcare are highly skilled professionals we are fortunate to have. It is essential they are treated as such, with pay and conditions that reflect the impact they have on so many young people.	spk_206
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-09-30	dail	33	Climate Action: Statements	dbsect_32	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the upcoming climate action plan. I agree with Deputy Devlin's comments on the S2S. It is very important infrastructure that will be very welcome and a huge asset to Dublin. The disastrous events across Europe this summer have brought home the painful reality of what lies ahead as the climate continues to change for the worse. The impact it will have on our day-to-day lives becomes clear when we see flash floods killing nearly 200 people in Germany and wildfires ravaging through Greece and Italy, burning hundreds and thousands of homes and leaving a trail of destruction and misery behind. Even here in Ireland, we had a number of wildfires that we struggled to bring under control. Howth was ablaze for almost a month and the fire there threatened to wipe out a number of homes on several occasions. These disastrous events will become more and more common as the years pass and we fail to tackle climate change effectively. Meaningful change and just transition seem to be completely missing from this Government's approach to climate change. We are not just failing when it comes to just transition or the need to reduce domestic CO² emissions; we are also failing Irish coastal communities which, on a frequent basis, have raw sewage flowing into their swimming areas. Sandymount strand is a site of enormous value to the many thousands of people across Dublin who use it for recreation. Sandymount and Dollymount are important biosphere sites of international importance and are recognised by UNESCO. At the mouth of Dublin Bay we have a wastewater treatment plant that was at capacity from the very first day construction was completed. When it rains, raw sewage is discharged. As we live in Ireland, that means there are regular discharges of raw sewage into Dublin Bay. That has serious consequences for people enjoying the sea, including swimmers and the rowing community. As we enter the winter months, increased rainfall will result in more frequent raw sewage leaks into Dublin Bay. Sea swimming has never been so popular in Dublin Bay. The Half Moon swimming club, which is located along the walk to the Poolbeg Lighthouse, is really popular. Over lockdown, sea swimming has increased dramatically in popularity, something that is likely to continue. It is a really positive activity and we must do everything we can to protect it. Allowing raw sewage into the sea is not doing that. Ringsend has two rowing clubs, St. Patrick's and Stella Maris, both of which put a huge amount of time and energy into training and into training children. Both of these clubs have contacted me to express concern after their members have seen raw sewage floating past them on the River Liffey. How is it acceptable in 2021 that we allow this polluting of Dublin Bay to continue? The Government cannot stand idly by and let the leaks continue while we wait for upgrading works to be completed. I accept that there are plans to increase the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant. Even when the construction of the extension is complete, however, it will still be at capacity, which means we will still have raw sewage being discharged into Dublin Bay after the extension. We need a short-term and a medium-term engineering solution to ensure our swimming areas are not no-go areas. The poor methods of communication between Dublin City Council and the EPA to the public when it comes to swimming bans on our beaches and shorelines need to be urgently addressed because they are dated and ineffective. If you want to find out whether there is a ban or see what the water quality is, you have to dig into websites and so on. The public just wants to go down and have a clear message of whether it is it safe to swim, and it should be in real time. We need swimming bans to be publicised in local media so that the public knows whether it is safe to swim.	spk_367
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-09-29	dail	33	Housing for All: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_14	The Housing for All plan mentions regeneration 29 times. The plan mentions urban regeneration but does not mention the regeneration of flat complexes within that context. There is no big plan for flat regeneration, which in many ways is the Cinderella of housing. We need an acceptance that there is an issue beyond patching up a few leaks in the roof. Regeneration of flat complexes like Pearse House, Glover’s Court, not too far from here, Rathmines Avenue flats, and flat complexes in Ringsend needs to be fast-tracked. Indeed, I cannot think of one flat complex that does not need a complete regeneration. Even the new York Street apartments, which are just 12 years old and won awards for their design when they were first built, are infested with rats and have ongoing flooding and other maintenance issues because of the neglect. One resident has been flooded seven times and is living in constant fear of it happening again. The conditions people are expected to live in are unacceptable in this day and age. The tenement-like conditions of flat complexes are as a result of the buildings' age and neglect and cannot be allowed to continue. There is rat infestation, raw sewage, electrical issues and severe dampness, which often makes clothes unwearable and, in some cases, rooms uninhabitable. Residents feel neglected by Dublin City Council and residents in Dublin's inner city feel the architecture they live in is more appreciated than they are as a community. Residents living in Mercer House, Markievicz House or Pearse House believe there is greater concern for the buildings they live in than there is for the living conditions they have to put up with daily. These complexes were originally, probably, the first Housing for All plan, which was at a time when the State was broke. The construction of these flat complexes showed great foresight by the State and the investment is now needed in the regeneration of flat complexes. If Dublin City Council was a private landlord, it could be brought to an independent arbitrator. That is not the case as the council is judge and jury and it has failed residents. The Government now needs to intervene.	spk_367
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-09-29	dail	33	Afghanistan Crisis: Statements	dbsect_15	"I welcome the recent announcement by the Government of the provision of 500 additional places for Afghan families here. The Minister stated that the people are very welcome and I wholeheartedly agree. They will add a great deal to Irish society and culture and will be a welcome addition. Following on from Deputy Martin Kenny's comments on that figure of 500, it is important it not be stuck to and adhered to rigidly. We have to be flexible and open to changes. I have no doubt the Minister believes the same and I would like to hear a commitment from him in that regard. The Afghan people have known nothing but war and occupation since the 1970s and it appears painfully clear the US never learned from the mistakes of previous wars. Since invading Afghanistan in 2001, the US has spent €2.3 trillion on the war, much of which was siphoned away by rampant institutionalised corruption. The US pursued a policy that prioritised spending on tanks, guns and bombers, rather than focusing on advancing and improving the lives of ordinary Afghans, both rural and urban. For all the trillions of euro spent, Afghanistan still has one of the smallest formal economies on the planet. Today, 10 million children are in need of emergency assistance, with many of them suffering from severe malnutrition. Countries can be occupied by sheer brute military force, but that alone cannot create the new progressive nation so many Afghans have dreamed of. Sadly, for the moment, that hope has been lost.  Senator Higgins recently organised a briefing on events in Afghanistan and the accounts from some of the contributors were harrowing. US and NATO war crimes in the region, and a lack of accountability for those who carried out these crimes, played into the hands of the extremist Taliban and kept much of the rural population cautious about US and NATO forces. Many of these war crimes only became public knowledge to us in the West thanks to the likes of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, people who risked everything to shine a light on the dark, shadowy actions of the US Government. Julian Assange has been incarcerated in Belmarsh Prison in London since 2019, even though his sentence has long been served. The UN special rapporteur on torture examined Mr. Assange in prison and concluded that he showed all the symptoms typical of prolonged exposure to psychological torture, including extreme stress, chronic anxiety and intense psychological trauma. The question must be asked as to how long it will be before Ireland and the EU speak out and say enough is enough and demand that Julian Assange be freed. This State's co-operation in respect of war in Iraq and Afghanistan has cast a dark shadow over our proud legacy of peacekeeping. Since the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, more than 10,000 military and military-contracted aircraft have passed through Shannon Airport, carrying some 3 million US soldiers and an untold number of weapons. Indeed, according to research, the airport has been used on a number of occasions by the US Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, during extraordinary rendition to carry prisoners to CIA black sites for advanced interrogation - more commonly known as torture. As Eduardo Galeano put it, every time the US ""saves"" a country, it converts it into either a madhouse or a cemetery. Time and again, these words have proven true. I compliment the Minister's office and Irish Aid for the commitment of these agencies and the delivery of overseas aid. The circumstances in which they work is difficult and challenging and it is important to acknowledge the contribution they have made to both Ireland and these deeply challenged communities throughout the world."	spk_401

Right across Dublin's inner city, residents are living in rat-infested conditions. Dublin City Council has failed in its responsibility to tenants. There is no independent arbitrator to whom residents can bring Dublin City Council. That, in my view, means that the Government needs to step in and ensure that the council does what it needs to do to address the many outstanding maintenance issues.

Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-09-23	dail	33	Ombudsman for Children's Initiative on Eliminating Child Poverty and Child Homelessness: Statements	dbsect_34	"I welcome this initiative, A Better Normal, from the Ombudsman for Children, in which there are many positives. In that context, I read the Government policy document Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures which refers to making ""investment in early years care and education, including maintaining the free preschool year and implementing measures to support and regulate improvements to the quality of Early Years and childcare services"". This is all great but it means absolutely nothing for parents of children with autism. In June, I asked the Minister for Education if she would intervene in the case of the new Shellybanks Educate Together National School in Sandymount which refused to open an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, class in September 2021, despite having the resources and capacity to do so. No classes opened in the school despite demands on behalf of children with autism. Children are still being bussed out of their community, even though there is space in the school for children with autism. What is missing is the will of the board to open ASD classes and include neuro-diverse children in this school. The two classes have been identified since last March after the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, visited the school. No infrastructural changes are required. I give credit to the Minister and the NCSE for pledging to provide all established additional supports necessary for the school to open these classes in September 2021. Since then, the management committee of the school pushed back against this recommendation. The only reason it has offered for doing so is that the classes are not ready yet and will not open until 2022. Unfortunately, many parents of neuro-diverse children do not have this luxury. How can such a situation still prevail? How can a school and its management board, despite the Department having cleared every obstacle for them, just say ""No"" and now is not the time? The Minister has failed to compel the school to open the ASD class, despite advice from her officials. We can have all the reports and plans we like but unless the will is there, children with autism will continue to pay the price."	spk_287

I would also like to acknowledge the work and professionalism of former Superintendent Joe Gannon, who has recently retired from his role in Pearse Street. I also acknowledge the huge good work that community Garda Derek Dempsey has done over 34 years of service in Ringsend, Irishtown and Sandymount. I wish them both well in their retirement. We all accept that we cannot have a garda standing on every corner. I also feel it is important to acknowledge we will not police our way out of the almost daily and ongoing violence that occurs in areas like Hanover Street East, where a local crèche regularly has to evacuate staff and children from its outdoor areas because of gangs fighting. We need to improve education and job opportunities for young people and we need to invest in assertive youth work. I recently met the Talk About Youth project, which does fantastic work with young people in Pearse Street but does not have a designated youth space. It is pushed from Billy to Jack, never knowing when it will have to move on again. SAYS youth club is in the same boat, having had to move its own youth space and it is now in temporary space, with no certainty. This can be resolved if there is genuine determination. I am inundated with messages from residents who are fearful for their children's safety and their own safety. Bride Street and Ross Road are like a sweet shop for drug dealers. Garda Shane Griffin from Kevin Street Garda station is doing great work, but he cannot do it on his own and he needs resources. Older people are afraid to leave their homes. Hanover Street, which I mentioned, is regularly like a fight zone. Dublin City Council and the Garda need to work together to tackle this. What we need is gardaí who are visible on a very regular basis but, again, this needs resources. The Mulvey report suggested a solution could be found to alleviate the issues in the inner city. It identified serious challenges in the north inner-city and the State has assigned resources to tackle these ongoing issues. What we need is a Mulvey-style response to the challenges in the south inner-city so that hard-to-engage youths are targeted and the systemic issues can be deconstructed, addressed and resolved for the betterment of all.	spk_224

The purpose of the Bill is simple, but its impact will have far-reaching benefits for thousands of workers amid the housing crisis. The Bill will remove the Part V affordable housing exemption for developers who purchased land in the past five years and who seek planning permission before the end of July 2026.This exemption represents yet another sweetheart deal by this Government for developers and investors. We have seen concession after concession for developers and investors while we have workers and their families being forced to pay very high rents and move far from their families and communities to find accommodation. When will we start to see meaningful breaks for ordinary working families? We are fortunate in Dublin Bay South to have many strong communities who believe in standing up for one another and their communities. I look at the Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group in particular. It has been a constant source of community in organising for the delivery of affordable homes for Ringsend and Irishtown. For too long, locals have been getting priced out of their community, with investors swooping in to buy up whatever homes are available. To add to this, we have high-tech firms coming in and pushing up the prices of homes and rentals for working families who lived and invested in the area long before the shiny, hugely profitable companies like Facebook, Google and now TikTok. We urgently need affordable public housing in this city and when we say affordable, we mean affordable to the community, not to the investment funds. An affordable price of upwards of €600,000 per unit is laughable. We need the delivery of affordable homes at the price of €250,000, like Ó Cualann, as the previous Deputy mentioned. In terms of public housing, we need to see a commitment from the Government that these units remain onsite within the community, not relocated far outside the original area. We cannot let what happened with the development of Capital Dock happen again, given the Part V units were not provided onsite or even locally, but instead miles up the road from the local community. Public housing needs to be delivered locally.	spk_161
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-09-16	dail	33	 Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_36	"I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021. As an elected representative for one of Dublin's coastal constituencies, I am all too well aware of the negative impact planning along the coastline has had on local communities, over the years and right up to the present day. This is an extremely important and vast piece of legislation and will have far-reaching consequences for generations to come.We need a robust system that will deliver for the State and, most importantly, our coastal communities, which have often been forgotten and failed. It is all well and good speaking about vast pieces of legislation, but I do not see us getting the basics right in Sandymount or Ringsend. When you walk down the Shelly Banks and around Sandymount strand and experience the dreadful smell of what the council tells us is Ectocarpus - there are vast amounts of it, making Sandymount strand almost unusable - or hear that another ""do not swim"" notice has been put in place, it is upsetting for residents and visitors. You might stroll by the Poolbeg lighthouse, which is a popular spot for sea swimming at the Half Moon swimming club, and see brown foam floating on the water's surface only to be told by officials it is harmless and just the result of heavy industry further up the Liffey. Sandymount strand as well as Clontarf in the north of Dublin are regularly unusable because of neglect by State authorities, including the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. During the winter, I regularly get reports from rowers in the Stella Maris Rowing Club and St. Patrick's Rowing Club of raw sewage floating past them as they row up the Liffey or along the coast. Recently, I reported what appeared to be waste discharge but was told it was grand. If you saw it, you would not put a dog in it, never mind kids. You would not feel safe even wading into it up to your ankles. This situation is not acceptable and has to change. We must do something about it. Coastal communities should not have to put up with these failures time and again. We need to start getting the basics right. The State needs to start delivering for these communities. We need additional water quality monitoring at beaches and shorelines where there are swimmers year round. Sea swimming has taken off and is something we must keep up with, but we are not at the moment. Information needs to be made available to the public rather than buried online. It needs to be published in local media and on social media. We need to escalate rapidly the development of infrastructure nationwide to treat raw sewage before it is discharged into coastal waters. We need short-term engineering solutions to be put in place while works are being carried out to prevent further discharges of raw sewage every time there is heavy rainfall. These requests are moderate and would improve the impact on coastal communities immensely."	spk_319
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-07-13	dail	33	Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_38	I take this opportunity to offer my congratulations to Deputy Bacik on her fantastic result in the recent by-election. It is a huge honour for her and her family. I look forward to working with her and her colleagues in the best interests of the constituency of Dublin Bay South. Many homeowners are deferring payment of their local property tax because it is not affordable for them. This is worrying for homeowners who are struggling to pay, for example, a resident on Lombard Street East who is in her 80s and is a double leg amputee. She would pay if she had the money. Unfortunately, she does not. Her only income is her welfare payment. If this were a wealth tax, she would not have to worry about it because she is not wealthy, but she must pay the property tax or else defer its payment. Property tax does not take into account a family or individual's ability to pay. Property tax is dependent on property prices, not the amount of money a homeowner has. If someone was ripped off when buying a home, the Government will tax him or her more. That is what is happening in areas like Ringsend and across the inner city, where large tech companies are pushing up prices and ordinary working families must pay more because of Government policy. We in Sinn Féin have a positive alternative. We are in favour of a wealth tax as part of our progressive tax reform proposals. This debate comes at a time when huge tech firms continue to escape proper taxation in Ireland, leaving a large hole in the Exchequer's finances that ordinary working families have to fill. It was recently highlighted that Google had moved more than €63 billion in profits out of Ireland using the controversial double Irish tax arrangement in 2019, which was the last year it could use the loophole. Ordinary homeowners like the elderly resident on Lombard Street East do not have loopholes of which they can take advantage. They just have to pay the property tax out of their pensions and get on with it. Another bone of contention is the lack of services provided by the council. If residents are paying a property tax, they expect to see some services. Trees are not being cut back and maintained, roots are becoming dangerous, particularly for older people, and weeds and dirt on the street are not being cleaned up. Residents groups must deal with these problems themselves. They are happy to do so, but they are not getting the assistance they need. I am not opposed to the property tax for the sake of it. I am opposed to the property tax because it is unfair.	spk_320

It has been reported that a row between Dublin City Council and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2019 scuppered plans to purchase lands at Poolbeg for affordable housing. Documents released under freedom of information to the  The inability to purchase new homes is nothing new for residents in Dublin Bay South. Young working families have not been able to purchase affordable homes for a long time. Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Amazon and now TikTok have all moved into the Ringsend and Pearse Street area and throughout south Dublin. As they have moved in, the price of buying and renting even modest homes has gone through the roof. Even if so-called affordable apartments are built, the reality is they will not be affordable to ordinary working families. Prices of €450,000, €500,000 and €600,000 are not affordable and this is what the affordable homes will cost. Of course, the Government's decision to allow vulture funds to buy up apartments will make ownership for ordinary working people a distant memory. They may be affordable to the high-paid executives working in the tech companies but not to young working families. They will have to continue to live with their parents or pay huge rents that prevent them from saving for a home. Capital Dock, which throws a shadow over Ringsend and Pearse Street, has massive rents and is of no benefit to the ordinary working people living in its shadow. No public housing was delivered in the Ringsend and Pearse Street area as a result of the Capital Dock development. Many of the apartments are empty in an effort to keep rents high and manipulate the market. In June of last year on Newstalk, the Minister said he would look at house prices in the region of €160,000 to €250,000 on a shared equity basis. Now it seems the affordable homes, if delivered in Ringsend, Harold's Cross or anywhere in Dublin Bay South, will be €450,000, which cannot possibly be classed as affordable. How can ordinary workers ever hope to buy a house in the community in which they went to school? Recently, I met the Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group with my colleagues, Senator Boylan, and Councillor Daniel Céitinn. The action group has campaigned tirelessly for affordable homes on the Irish Glass Bottle site and is extremely concerned there will be no public or affordable housing on the site. It is also concerned that if there is affordable housing it will not be affordable to ordinary working families. Will the Minister state there will be affordable homes on the Irish Glass Bottle site and that they will not cost more than €450,000? Homes need to be building blocks for stronger communities and not just assets from which to make profits. Fine Gael represents the vulture funds, and it was ably assisted by the Labour Party and Deputy Howlin when he was a Minister in partnership with Fine Gael. Like most Deputies in Dublin Bay South, I am regularly contacted by residents in Ringsend, Sandymount and Pearse Street desperate for secure and decent accommodation. They are not looking to get it for free. One family recently contacted me because their council flat has three teenagers in one bedroom. The girl has the single bunk and shares with her two teenage brothers. Both parents work hard and pay €150 a week for a flat that is barely habitable despite their best efforts to keep it well, which they do given the circumstances. Their children are afraid to leave the flat because of the drug dealing and random violence around their home. They pay €600 a month to Dublin City Council and they feel trapped and worried, not for themselves but for their children. Yesterday, I met another couple who have one child. They both have jobs with two relatively good incomes. They do not qualify for public housing because of their income. They do not qualify for a mortgage because of their income. They are trapped in uncertain rental and they are weary. As they said, they feel broken. This is what the Government policy is doing. It is breaking people and it is breaking society. The Irish Glass Bottle site should be a real opportunity for people to be housed in decent, safe and secure accommodation. However, this will not happen with the plans the Government has for affordable housing. On 8 July there will be a by-election, as the Minister knows as he was canvassing yesterday. Residents will have an opportunity to tell the Government they are fed up with its housing policy and they want public homes on public land. They want affordable homes and affordable rental that ordinary people can afford. This needs to be our town and not ""Googletown""."	spk_193
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-06-22	dail	33	State Pension Age: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_12	Every year, workers are forced out of their employment for no reason other than they have turned 65 years of age. Irish law allows their age to be the defining factor in whether they can continue in employment, regardless of their ability to carry out the work. This is possible because Irish law allows employers to impose mandatory retirement ages on staff contracts of employment, facilitating ageism within the workplace and creating a set of second-class employment rights for older workers. Every worker in the State makes a significant and valuable contribution during their working lives. We talk about looking after older people who have contributed to the State throughout their lives, yet we force them onto the dole queue when they hit 65. We all know the vast majority of people at 65 will not get a job. At a time when citizens should be able to take their foot off the gas or continue working, this Government wants them to sign on the dole. It is a charade in which the Government is forcing older people to take part. To make matters worse, it wants them to take part in the charade for less money than they would have got on their pension. That is rubbing salt into the wounds. Workers should have the right to retire at 65 with their State pension or the freedom to remain in work if they so decide. The Government cannot keep moving the goalposts when it comes to the retirement age for the State pension, from 65 to 66, and to 67 in the new year. The Government’s next move will be to increase the pension age to 68. Where will it stop? That is a real concern. A pension age of 68 would be one of the highest in the OECD. If someone wants to retire at 65, that should be their choice, taking into consideration their physical, mental and family circumstances. They must also have the choice to work on.	spk_175

Families with autism have to fight for absolutely everything. If we had a strategy, it would ensure that we have enough neurodiverse places in our schools. With the strategy, we would have proper supports for children in secondary school. My colleague, Senator Boylan, and I recently met with Autism Equality Dublin Bay parents group. They raised with us the fact that one school in Sandymount, the Shelleybanks Educate Together School, will not be opening an ASD class in September. It is really difficult to understand how any school in this day and age would not want to have an ASD class. I understand that the Department has made resources available to the school and the capacity is there, yet it will still not open a class. This is unacceptable and shameful. I think the Minister of State would agree with that. I call on the Minister of State to directly intervene and compel the Shelleybanks Educate Together School in Sandymount to open an ASD class in September. Like every community, we have children with additional needs. Every morning they should be able to walk through the school gates with their brothers and sisters. It is ironic that the school's name contains the phrase ""Educate Together"", yet it refuses to educate all children together. The Involve Autism advocacy group has harvested the facts to show how much is being spent on bussing children out of their communities in Dublin 6 and 6W. The lack of ASD class places in these two communities is shocking. There are 20 schools in Dublin 6 and 6W and there are no ASD classes in Dublin 6. Despite the section 37A process, there are no ASD classes in the area. The Minister of State needs to intervene and compel schools to open additional needs classes in Dublin 6 and 6W. No amount of resistance from the board of management of the Shelleybanks Educate Together School can be tolerated. A lack of resources cannot be used as an excuse. I do not believe that it is an excuse. The lack of will to provide the classes by the school and the board of management is the biggest obstacle, at board level and political level. This issue does not only impact on primary schools, it also impacts on secondary schools. The national autism impairment strategy would address this deficit. We need ministerial action and intervention with the schools that are pushing back against families and children with autism."	spk_289
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-06-01	dail	33	Situation in Belarus: Motion	dbsect_17	The forced landing of Ryanair flight FR 4978, an Irish aeroplane, put Ireland centre stage of an international incident. That any state would force an aeroplane to carry out an emergency landing to arrest a political opponent is wrong and cannot be tolerated. The Government, along with the rest of the EU, was fast and decisive in the approach to dealing with the forced landing and the arrest of the journalist, an outspoken critic of the Belarusian Government. Freedom of the press and of political expression must be defended and upheld. This international incident has rightly called into question the role of the EU and the international community in defending the freedom of the press and political expression. Ireland's voice must be loud and clear in defending these values. We cannot allow trade deals to buy silence and inaction when these values are targeted by various governments. However, the strong, decisive and swift response towards Belarus with the imposition of sanctions highlights a certain double standard when it comes to defending these values. Where were the sanctions against the apartheid state of Israel, following the targeted bombing of several press and media outlets in Gaza last month by Israeli war planes? Al Jazeera's buildings were levelled. Where was the strong, decisive action when Israel's apartheid security forces physically assaulted and detained journalists who were covering the protests in occupied Palestine? These were clear acts to intimidate and suppress the freedom of the press. Could the Minister indicate how much longer the EU will remain silent while the journalist, Julian Assange, is held captive? Julian Assange has done the world a great service by exposing crimes and human rights violations in Iraq and Afghanistan. He deserves everybody's gratitude, not his incarceration. When will Ireland speak up for these and all journalists, not just a select few?	spk_187
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-05-25	dail	33	Annexation of Palestine: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_9	The kidnapping of a young journalist by Belarus was met with loud shouts from the Government and the EU about the need for swift action, sanctions and severe consequences. The Taoiseach said the kidnapping was a state-sponsored coercive act and that the EU would respond very strongly. These strong words and plans for actions and sanctions contrast starkly with the weak and watery position and language directed at Israel for the murder and terror inflicted on Palestine over 11 days, which killed 248 Palestinians. Yesterday, EU leaders agreed a range of sanctions and actions against Belarus almost overnight. However, all we heard about from the Government during the slaughter and terror in Palestine was building consensus, how now was not the right time to recognise the state of Palestine and that we could not introduce sanctions. It is shocking but hardly surprising. The Minister and I know - we all know - that no consensus will be reached because Israel and its sponsors do not want consensus. They want to wipe out Palestine and make a two-state solution impossible. The Government talks about a two-state solution yet only recognises one of those states, and that is the apartheid, racist terror state that is Israel. US President Joe Biden has said in the past that there is no space between the United States and Israel. Over the last week, this Government has shown that there is no space between it and Israel and that there is no space between the EU and Israel. If we are going to stop the slaughter in Palestine, we need to recognise the state of Palestine. We need to implement Senator Black's occupied territories Bill. We need to boycott Israel, we need divestment from Israel and sanctions against it. We need to make it clear to Israel that its land grabs and annexation do not have Ireland's support and that when it grabs land from people and takes other people's homes, there will be consequences because until now there have been none.	spk_150

Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-05-19	dail	33	Financial Resolution: Stamp Duties	dbsect_26	"The proposal that is before us will do nothing other than reinforce the reality that the Government is led by the interests of developers, vulture funds and cuckoo funds. I represent the constituency of Dublin Bay South where, generation after generation, in communities like those in Pearse Street, Kevin Street, Ringsend and around the Iveagh Trust, people have grown up in apartments and flats. Those apartments and flats are homes as well and the inner-city communities who live in them matter. Unless apartments are included in measures to tackle cuckoo funds, we will witness the fast-tracking of ordinary working families being pushed out of their communities. Many people in the inner city believe there is already a process of social cleansing taking place. The gentrification of long-established working-class communities has been gathering pace. These proposals will mean the Government is, in effect, abandoning inner-city communities and handing the inner city over to vulture funds. People who grew up in areas like Ringsend, Pearse Street, Rathmines and Harold's Cross are well used to not being able to afford a home locally. The big companies like Google and Facebook have been moving into urban villages like Irishtown and Harold's Cross. As they move in, prices soar and become increasingly unaffordable. Huge areas of the inner city are made up of apartments and flats. The docklands area is almost all apartments. The plan for the Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend will see 3,500 new homes, all of them apartments. These proposals will have no impact on that plan. What will stop vulture funds from coming in and buying up all the apartments on the site? This resolution certainly will not. What will the Minister say to the residents in Irishtown who were hoping to buy an affordable house there? The Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group, which has fought hard for new homes on the site, fears there will be no affordable homes delivered. A home that costs €450,000 is not affordable. The group has not been reassured by the Government or Dublin City Council that the homes promised by the previous Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be delivered. These proposals will not protect those 3,500 new homes from vulture or cuckoo funds. In ten years' time, all of the 3,500 new homes on the Poolbeg Peninsula could well be owned by a vulture fund charging vast amounts in rent. There will be no one who went to primary school in Ringsend or Pearse Street living in those apartments because they will not be able to afford them. A total of 900 of the homes planned for construction on the Irish Glass Bottle site will be public and affordable. That means they will cost €450,000, which is not affordable. It is unlikely that many of the children who went to Marian College, Ringsend College or Westland Row CBS will be able to afford them. The idea that they will be classed as affordable at a price of €450,000 is mind-boggling. Project Ireland 2040 outlines what it sees as the future of the growth of Dublin. It states, ""Identifying a number of ambitious large-scale regeneration areas for the provision of new housing and employment throughout the city and metropolitan area and the measures required to facilitate them as integrated, sustainable development projects."" What is sustainable about letting investment funds buy up the bulk of apartments in Dublin city? What is sustainable about enabling those funds to rent out apartments for sky-high rents? What is sustainable about the funds' practice of leaving apartments empty for years if the sky-high rent prices cannot be obtained? There is a prime example of this in the Capital Dock development, a stone's throw from Whelan House in Ringsend and Pearse House on Pearse Street. The rent for a two-bedroom apartment there is €4,000 per month. The local community lost out when the Part V provision for Capital Dock was delivered outside the area. The rents are only affordable for some senior executives in the construction and technology sectors, which means the locals lose out again. This sort of development is not sustainable unless one is a lucky winner of the EuroMillions draw. How can anyone take seriously what the Government says about making Dublin a more liveable and sustainable city when it continues to allow these cuckoo funds to run riot?"	spk_322
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-05-18	dail	33	Affordable Housing: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	I commend Deputy Eoin Ó Broin for this motion on housing and for all the work he has done around this issue. The inability to purchase new homes because they are unaffordable is nothing new to residents living in Dublin Bay South. Young working families have not been able to purchase affordable homes for a long time. Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Amazon and now TikTok have all moved into Ringsend, the Pearse Street area and right across south Dublin. As they have moved in, the prices of buying and renting even modest homes have gone through the roof. Earlier this year, Deputy Ó Broin got information under freedom of information which showed that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was told that Dublin City Council was under pressure to secure the funds to purchase the two sites where the affordable and public housing will be situated on the Irish Glass Bottle Company site. It is reported that many working in Dublin City Council housing section seem to doubt whether affordable homes can be delivered on the Irish Glass Bottle Company site, and even if they are delivered, it seems they will not be affordable to ordinary working families. They may be affordable to the high paid executives working in the tech companies but not to young working families who have to continue to live with their parents or pay huge rents that prevent them from saving for a home. In June of last year, on NewsTalk, the Minister said that he would be looking at house prices in the region of €160,000 to €180,000, and from €230,000 to €250,000 on a shared equity basis. Now, it seems the affordable homes, if delivered in Ringsend, Harolds Cross or right across south Dublin and Dublin city, will be in the region of €450,000. That cannot possibly be classed as affordable. How can ordinary working families ever hope to buy a house in the community they went to school in? The Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group, which has campaigned tirelessly for affordable homes on the Irish Glass Bottle Company site, is extremely concerned that people will not be able to afford affordable housing there, that is if there is any affordable housing because the €450,000 clearly cannot be reached by many people who have grown up and lived in the community. The Minister needs to state clearly that there will be affordable homes on the Irish Glass Bottle Company site and that they will not cost €450,000. We need to make homes affordable again.	spk_277

The sport of MMA has grown immensely over the past decade. Participation in MMA in Ireland is very diverse. If one walks into any MMA club, one will see a mix of people ranging from office workers to construction workers, young and old. One will see a real mix of nationalities training side by side. We have also seen the great potential MMA can offer young people through programmes such as the MMA coaching and education programme in Drogheda. The aim of this programme is to provide support for young people caught up in antisocial activity and to help them move off that particular path. Following the tragic death of João Carvalho in 2016, which has been mentioned, the Coroner's Court recommended the introduction of standardised safety procedures and protocols for MMA events in Ireland in addition to raising the need to expedite the endorsement of a national governing body, NGB, for MMA. The IMMAA was founded in 2017 and has introduced exceptionally high safety standards for amateur athletes involved in MMA. These standards are properly higher than those for any other contact sport under the remit of Sport Ireland. IMMAA athletes have consistently represented Ireland very strongly. At the 2018 world amateur MMA championships, Ireland came second in the context of the number of medals won. These amateur athletes deserve proper recognition.  There is currently no clear path for the IMMAA to become recognised as an NGB, despite its best efforts.

It is important that we put in place measures to tackle ticket touting. As society continues to reopen and as live events open again to the public, hopefully soon albeit with restricted numbers, it is safe to say that tickets will be in high demand. It is, however, disappointing that it has taken so long to get to this stage. It is four years since my colleague, an Teachta Quinlivan, introduced anti-ticket touting legislation to the Dáil, only to have it blocked by the Government. In the past, Fine Gael claimed, on the one hand, that it wanted to put an end to ticket touting while, on the other hand, actively putting up barriers against ticket touting legislation. I hope this legislation can be enacted as soon as possible for the benefit of music and sports fans as we open up live events. Sporting events are so important to so many of us. That includes going to watch a game of cricket in Claremont Road in Sandymount, which is a great community hub. Unfortunately, the YMCA is trying to sell the ground, which would be a major loss to the local Sandymount community and a great blow to the cricketing community. The cricket club has been in Sandymount for 110 years and the YMCA is now trying to extinguish this amazing facility.The club was developing the facility as a hub for cricket development. It is vital to preserve facilities like Claremont Road and I urge the YMCA to reflect on its plans to sell off the site. In my view, the sale of the YMCA grounds is contrary to its own ethos. The State has invested in this site and the facilities of the YMCA over the years but now the YMCA just wants to pack up and go off. It is not acceptable.

Contrary to what most ordinary people think, housing units are now viewed by the State as assets for the purpose of generating capital for investors ahead of building homes for workers. This may have come as a shock to many after what we saw happen in Maynooth. However, this has been a visible reality within communities across Dublin Bay South and inner city Dublin for years now. First-time buyers in communities like Ringsend, Kevin Street, Harold's Cross, Rathmines and even Ranelagh are all too familiar with seeing the same faces at each viewing, buying up home after home for a third party on behalf of these investment funds. Dublin Bay South has traditionally not been a strong support base for Sinn Féin. However, one of the key elements as to why Sinn Féin did so well there in the general election was down to the then Government's failure on housing. We had canvassers from Ranelagh and Rathmines. We got votes in those areas because people were fed up with the Government's housing policy. Anyone who thinks that a Fine Gael success in the forthcoming by-election in the constituency is going to be a slam dunk is going to be in for a surprise. The issue of housing has not gone away. Those who were shocked at what happened in Maynooth were silent when the same thing was effectively happening in the inner city, with working-class families being pushed out right across the Docklands. In communities in that area, families had to watch their sons and daughters being pushed far outside those communities and having to live far away from them and their friends on foot of the actions of vulture funds and the big tech companies that rip communities apart. Once again, we see profit margins being allowed to reign supreme over local communities. As is often the case, these crises only seem to trigger outrage in the media when the issue transcends traditional class lines. Housing needs to be seen as a building block for communities not an asset from which to make financial profits.	spk_179

We are in the depths of a housing crisis and have been for many years. I see the reality of this crisis every day across the communities in Dublin Bay South. There is a chronic shortage of affordable housing for first-time buyers. Public housing such as Glovers Court, Bishop Street, Cuffe Street and Mercer House are all within 500 m of Leinster House and have all been condemned as substandard by the European Committee of Social Rights. I do not know of a single flat complex across the constituency that could be deemed good, liveable and safe accommodation. There is public housing with extreme mould and dampness. Raw sewage flooded over a public area in Canon Mooney Gardens in Ringsend over the weekend. Rat invasions are an everyday issue for tenants living in flats. There are dangerous electrics and regular flooding within the flat complexes themselves. The list is endless and it is not acceptable to expect families to live in these conditions. We have vulture funds swooping in and buying up new houses in bulk that should be homes for first-time buyers. We facilitate these vulture funds and let them enjoy generous tax breaks and avoid paying corporation tax or capital gains tax and the full rate of stamp duty. Where is the break for ordinary working families, like the generous tax breaks these vulture funds have got? When will enough be enough? Do working families not deserve a break too? Unlike other crises we have faced and are still facing as a society, few see an end to this housing crisis through the policies being developed by this Government, given its record. Leasing for Part V arrangements is yet another example of policies to suit developers and investors at the expense of the State. The cost of renting in this State has increased by in excess of 60% over the past ten years, more than four times the average increase across the eurozone. By allowing leasing for Part V arrangements we are effectively locking local authorities into long-term leasing arrangements at a time when rents nationwide have hit a peak even greater than that experienced during the Celtic tiger era. It is beyond me how anyone could view this as a wise strategy for local authorities to use when tackling this housing crisis. It is plain to see that this is another example of developer-led housing policy to suit investors at the expense of the State. This Government should put in place supports for local authorities to build their own housing on their own sites, thereby providing public housing to an appropriate standard because the standard and quality are not acceptable.	spk_279

I am deeply concerned by the notable lack of several important elements that are needed to tackle climate change effectively. The legislation does not include a number of commitments made in the programme for Government, which is very telling about the priorities of a certain party of government when it comes to climate action. Where is the provision for a meaningful just transition? Without it, communities will be left behind and public buy-in to a decarbonised future will be lost. I am concerned that the Bill does not include a ban on the importing of fracked gas into Ireland. That is a missed opportunity. We share our world and no nation can stop this crisis on its own. That is why our actions must be of a collective mindset. By allowing the importation of fracked gas, we are, by default, making Ireland a supporter of fracking. It seems the only concern is that the fracking is not done in this country and in our sight. Profits reign superior to the environment and local communities. This missed opportunity reminds me of when the EU banned the use of dangerous pesticides, which was the correct stance to take. However, it allowed the large chemical corporations to continue to manufacture and export those harmful pesticides to the global south, thereby ensuring their profits at the expense of others. When it comes to climate action, an attitude of see no evil and hear no evil is fooling no one. Fracked gas might appear cheap but it comes with a heavy and very damaging cost to our environment. Climate action is a huge step and we all need to play our part in it. There is much talk about global change and global action but we seem to ignore what is happening on our own doorstep. The Ringsend waste water treatment plant on the Poolbeg Peninsula regularly discharges raw sewage into Dublin Bay, mostly during winter. The condition of the water last weekend was disgusting. While it may not have contained raw sewage, it was not of a quality such that I would let a child or dog paddle in it. People should not be afraid of what they might step in on the beach at Sandymount Strand. Last summer, residents found the beach was almost unusable because of an algae bloom. The experts tell us this is a natural occurrence. Algae bloom may be natural but the amount that grows on Sandymount Strand is not natural. It grows in such volumes because of the particulates discharged into Dublin Bay. For many months of the year, it makes Sandymount Strand a no-go zone. This is not good enough. We need a short-term engineering solution to stop the regular discharges into Dublin Bay from the waste water treatment plant. We need the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and Dublin City Council to carry out an audit of the heavy industries on the Poolbeg peninsula and to heavily fine or shut down any that are not compliant with good practice.

Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-04-21	dail	33	Mental Health Surge Capacity: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_2	"I acknowledge this important motion brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Ward. We all know how Covid has taken its toll on mental health. Speaking to parents and young people, every one of them says they are in varying degrees of stress and anxiousness. Children have been missing their sports for more than a year. That void has had a huge impact on their mental health and placed increased stress on their siblings and parents. People who otherwise would have had good mental health are struggling and those who were previously struggling are in distress. I heard William Cummings, who does fantastic work with the Be Aware Be Safe, BABS, listening service say recently: ""It's only when we listen we truly understand, when we understand we can begin to help.""We need significant investment in non-medical support for talk therapy to reduce the numbers of those with poor mental health from becoming increasingly distressed. Sinn Féin would invest €10 million in a talk therapy fund, which would create 128,000 sessions with accredited counsellors or therapists in the private system for urgent care on referral from a GP. We would ensure that before individuals are in distress they are able to talk to a professional who engages with them. This fund and service would be really important and help to prevent individuals from entering emergency services. This emergency talk therapy fund must be a priority. In line with this, there needs to be universal counselling within primary care services so that counselling services are not barred from individuals because they just missed out on qualifying for a medical card. Sending an individual who is suicidal to an emergency department has clearly not worked because we do not have the required services. We need to open private hospital care so that pressure is released within the public health system. I recently read that emergency departments are like ground zero for mental health patients. We have one of the lowest proportions of hospital beds for psychiatric care in the developed world and the numbers drop each year. With every bed that is lost, the threshold to admit someone to hospital must rise. Patients need to be increasingly sicker before they can be admitted to hospital. This is 2021. We have had Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil working together for almost five years and a Fine Gael-led Government before that. They cannot wash their hands of the mental health emergency we have. Mental health is not a nine-to-five issue; it is a 24-7 issue and needs to be resourced to reflect this."	spk_4

It is not this Government it seems. The strain on carers and families is horrendous at the best of times. During this pandemic, however, it has been unbearable. We need to invest in carers. Doing so would be a win-win for both families and the State. It would take pressure off hospitals, nursing homes and GP services. Investing in respite should not be seen as a cost because it is not. The savings would be immeasurable. The State would save on many levels. Financially, there would be a saving for the health system, a saving much greater than what is spent on carers. We need to give more to make their lives bearable because they currently are not. Last week, we heard about the State putting together secret dossiers on families of children with autism to use against them. That is what the State thinks of families who are already struggling and caring for loved ones. I have spoken with carers from Ringsend to Rathmines, from Kevin Street to Kimmage. They are all saying that they are hanging on by their fingertips. This Sinn Féin motion will prioritise carers in the vaccine roll-out. Carers are caring for highly vulnerable people but, as they are not considered as a group, they fall through the net. It is possible that some carers, despite the huge strain they are under, could be among the last to be vaccinated on an individual basis. Each day carers are not vaccinated is another day they play Russian roulette with loved ones. The stress and anxiety this leads to is having a hugely negative impact on carers and their mental health. Carers are vital but they are not valued. This motion makes provision to support carers financially, improve the level of respite available and ensure that the compilation of secret dossiers on families challenging the State will end. Day services would also be resumed. Carers do not need any sympathy or rounds of applause. They need action and support. Our motion would deliver the change carers deserve and give them the support they desperately need. Let us not just recognise carers as being vital, let us value them. Let us give carers a break.	spk_12

I compliment the work that has been put into the Bill by the 1916 relatives' group, whose commitment to saving Moore Street and preserving our history has never wavered. One can travel to almost any nation across the world and see the value and respect they put on sites that played a significant role in the shaping of their nationhood, whether it is Gettysburg in the USA, Flanders in Belgium or Brest Fortress in Belarus. Moore Street and the laneways surrounding it are no different to those aforementioned battlefields. Moore Street holds significant importance in the birth of our nation and revolutionary history. This battlefield must be preserved as a national monument and as a living museum would safeguard our history for the generations to come.  The Bill creates many more opportunities than simply listing Moore Street as a national monument. It will develop Moore Street into a cultural quarter. It will give the community within the inner city an opportunity to regenerate and develop into a living city with sustainability, history and culture at its heart.  When I think of the long battle to save Moore Street, I always think of The O'Rahilly who, after leading a charge of Moore Street, was mortally wounded by several bullets. He wrote a note to his darling Nancy as he lay dying. It finished simply saying, ""It was a good fight anyhow"". As we approach the 105th anniversary of the Easter Rising, we are still here fighting to protect Moore Street and give it the value and respect of which it is worthy.  Our history, heritage and culture cannot be left in the hands of private developers. It is too important and valuable.We do not want a repeat of what happened at The O'Rahilly house in Herbert Park.

I commend the work done by the survivor groups, the adoptee groups and Deputy Funchion in bringing it before the Dáil. The purpose of this Bill is simple and straightforward, namely, to give every adopted person the right to access his or her birth certificate. The vast majority of Deputies who will be voting on this Bill and on whether to give adoptees access to this most basic of human rights will undoubtedly have always had access to their own birth certificate and many will have taken that for granted throughout their lives. It is so often the case that only when we see the suffering and lack of equality for others that we realise how fortunate many of us have been and we can then start to address where the State has failed so many people. Access to the most basic of personal information about who you are should be a fundamental right that cannot be denied. For far too long, the survivors of mother and baby homes have been denied this basic personal information. Survivors feel that time and again they have been lied to, tricked and made to feel like criminals for seeking out their most basic personal information. Enough is enough. It is time that the State stands with those who have endured so much and give them the respect they deserve. This Bill is a small but important step on the journey to give survivors that respect and the support they deserve. It is time to listen to survivors and start righting these wrongs. Let us not bury this legislation in the process. I urge all Deputies to support the Bill.	spk_2
Chris Andrews	45	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2021-03-04	dail	33	Land Development Agency Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_2	This legislation allows for public land to be used for unaffordable private market housing. This is coupled with a failure to prioritise the delivery of public and genuinely affordable homes. The Bill is deeply undemocratic and once again takes decision-making away from councillors and the local community. I recently saw a photo from 1974 of a housing protest on City Quay. The community was protesting that not enough homes and too many office blocks were being built. Decades later the same protests are being held and the same issues are still there. Inner-city communities are still being forgotten about. Big vulture funds and high-tech companies are still being facilitated at the expense of long-time residents. We need genuinely affordable homes for the residents living in inner-city communities such as Ringsend, Pearse Street, Ross Road and Kevin Street. This Bill links affordability to the market rate. That would be great if the market rate was relatively normal, but in some areas, such as the ones I have just mentioned, the market rate means homes are only accessible to the highly paid and the very wealthy. There is a two-bedroom house in Ringsend advertised in  The sector happiest with the Bill will be the developers, who will get a hold of private land and will not need to work with representatives in an area they want to develop. The Bill does not mention public housing at a time when housing is increasingly unaffordable, when housing such as Glover's Court, which is not too far from here, is effectively uninhabitable and when homes across the city are swamped with rats and suffer from bad housing maintenance. We cannot afford to give away our land to private developers for private developments. Capital Dock, which is a stone's throw from Pearse Street, has 190 apartments, of which 90 are empty. This is happening in so many developments across the city, the reason being that the vulture funds that own them are keeping them empty so the rents are artificially high. It should also be noted that the Capital Dock development in the south inner city and many like it, particularly in Ringsend and the Pearse Street area, are not getting the 10% social housing requirements delivered in their communities. It is being allocated in other communities further out. Therefore, not only is housing unaffordable; the community is being pulled apart and moved out of the city because of the failure by Government to ensure that the 10% public housing requirement is delivered locally within the community. This Bill will not serve the communities that elected me.	spk_3

More than 20,000 children with additional needs in mainstream classes were promised a return on 21 January. The Minister wrote to school principals on 11 January to say the return of those children to school would happen but it did not. Those children were assured priority all along and have been completely forgotten about. The provision offered for students with additional needs is for special needs assistants to come into their houses in evenings and at weekends. It is understandable that very few students, if any, will want that. Parents who have children with additional needs have contacted me and want to know why their children were suddenly dropped as a priority from the return to school policy. They were promised priority. It is not acceptable to wait until the middle of April, nor is it acceptable that we leave our children with additional needs until last. We should be putting our children with additional needs first. We are talking about a return to school but it is important to remember that many children, on returning to school, will be sent on a bus and driven past the schools of their brothers or sisters. As we know, there has been a section 37A review of ASD autism classes in the south Dublin area. Many parents and multiple advocacy groups like Involve Autism and Autism Equality Dublin Bay have expressed their great disappointment at both the approach and the outcome. At the end of the process, there are approximately 140 ASD special classes in Dublin 24, which is an increase of approximately 60 places on the position prior to the commencement of the process. In Dublin 6, there were zero classes and that continues to be the case. Likewise, nothing has been provided for early intervention or secondary level. Parents who experienced exclusion and discrimination are being further excluded. As part of the process of engaging with schools with a view to opening new autism classes, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, openly admits that the Department of Education does not have an inventory of school accommodation. This is damning. The approach taken by the NCSE and the Department to the 37A process was disappointing to say the least. They did not engage with schools and the schools were only inspected after the mandate. They disregarded where the lack of places was, which will mean more children leaving their communities on buses and in taxis. Apart from the ethical issues, in south Dublin alone, more than €63,000 is spent every single day just transporting children in buses and taxis. It is absolutely bonkers to be spending that sort of money on children with additional needs to bus them out of their communities. This approach of anywhere will do for children with autism and additional needs must stop. The Minister must apply the section 37A process to these areas again, specifically Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W, which were left untouched by the process and where there are more than 6,000 primary school children. I appreciate the Minister may say they are still in a legislative process, but as none of the schools in these areas are in the process, she should be able to act and finally stand up for children with additional needs. Will the Minister start a new section 37A process for areas in south Dublin, in particular Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W, which have been left untouched by the previous section 37A process?	spk_205

In recent months they have seen more and more patients referred to community pharmacies for what would have been standard procedures in any general practitioner practice, including blood pressure and supervised methadone checks. Their face-to-face contact with patients has dramatically increased to allow for the reduction in face-to-face contact for patients with local GPs. They have shouldered their fair share in this pandemic. In keeping the pressure off local GPs as much as possible, the risk to them has dramatically increased but the protections have not. If a pharmacist in the HSE becomes pregnant, she is given the maximum protection possible. She works remotely from home for the full duration of the pregnancy. However, if a pharmacist in a community pharmacy becomes pregnant, she shows up to work every day as normal right up to the weeks before she gives birth, despite the significant increase in risk for her and her unborn child. Pharmacists will be needed for an effective mass roll-out of these vaccines. This will have to involve not only those working for the HSE but the thousands throughout the State working in local community pharmacies. When will community pharmacists be vaccinated?

The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that people can no longer be discriminated against on the basis that they are from a disadvantaged socio-economic area, background or accent. For example, if this Bill is enacted, employers and service providers could not discriminate against a job applicant or current employee because of their accent or the socio-economic status of the area they come from. Over the past 20 years, there have been countless reports and many recommendations have been made for this inclusion. In 2019, Paul McKeon, on behalf of the Institute of International and European Affairs, noted in his work that the continued exclusion of socio-economic status has created a hierarchy of equality in Ireland, where the State sends a message that it has protections against some forms of discrimination but allows others. During the previous Dáil, Fianna Fáil looked to pass a similar Bill and got support from Sinn Féin and the Greens. I hope that support will be returned for this Bill, which will address the concerns Fianna Fáil and the Green Party had then. On the topic of lived experience in parts of the Dublin South-East constituency which I serve, this is a systemic issue that dates back generations for people who live in local authority flat complexes and who report high levels of generational and present-day social exclusion and discrimination, which is directly and indirectly due to their social and economic background. In one example, a young constituent from a flat complex, who had a master’s degree and is a fluent Portuguese speaker, reported to me that after submitting a video application for a job in a multinational company, he was later contacted by a concerned employee of that large multinational company. This employee informed him that fellow employees had joked and mocked the young individual’s inner-city Dublin accent, with one questioning how and where ""the knacker"" picked up Portuguese while reviewing his video application. On a final note, this Bill is an important step in sending out a message to society and to those who are affected by this type of discrimination that it is unacceptable. I believe the Government can, and will, support this Bill."	spk_131

The current setback is nothing new for them. One example of the ongoing battle that children with additional needs have is the 37A process for autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes in south Dublin, which was set in train by the former Minister, Deputy McHugh, and has now finished. Following the closure of the 37A process for ASD classes no classes were established in Dublin 4 or Dublin 6 as a result of the process. Considering the enormous impact this is having on families in Ringsend, Milltown, Ranelagh and throughout Dublin 4 and Dublin 6, there is an urgent need for a specific 37A process for Dublin 4 and Dublin 6. The absence of ASD classes is unacceptable. We now have a situation where there are no ASD classes in Dublin 4 or Dublin 6 after the 37A process. We know what has to be done and the Minister needs to do it. Action and resources are needed. I have spoken to many schools in Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 and they are willing to set up ASD classes but what they do not want, and what the parents of children with autism do not want, is an autism class wedged into a school that looks like an afterthought. Properly constructed and resourced classes need to be installed and the funding needs to be invested in our children as a matter of urgency. This needs to be done so classes meet the needs of children with autism and are not just box-ticking exercises. It seems when it comes to children with autism and their education that any place will do. This cannot be allowed any more. ASD classes in Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 need to be resourced and open as at matter of urgency. The Minister speaks regularly about inclusion but, unfortunately, the reality is very different. Last year, the Government spent more than €100 million transporting special needs children out of their communities when they should be in their local schools. There are no official figures for the number of children who are not receiving the education they require. The Department and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have no idea how many children in Ringsend, Sandymount, Ranelagh and throughout Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 need special education and this is absolutely bonkers. We would not let a new school or extension be built without a wheelchair ramp and disabled access being installed. Why are schools being built that do not have ASD classes? How can we have extensions to schools but no additional ASD classes? I know the Minister has given commitments to change this but, like many families of children with additional needs, I will not believe any commitment until I see it delivered. What we have now is educational apartheid and we must change this urgently. By any statistical measure this has never been truer than it is in Dublin 4 and Dublin 6.

However, there is a real sense among other sports that the GAA is getting preferential treatment. The Olympian Rob Heffernan recently highlighted that the Government does not consider four athletes who are going to the Olympic Games next year to be elite enough to compete in the world-class facilities we have in this country. How can the Government state that Olympians are not elite and, therefore, cannot compete? Athletics competitions are outdoor and non-contact, yet they are not allowed to go ahead at an elite level. All sports must be treated equally and the Government needs to widen its definition of what is elite. Athletics events are being run in the North and throughout Europe. Athletes have been travelling throughout Europe and the world to compete. Few, if any, have become sick. Sport Ireland has given a directive that it does not want people travelling, but it is not ensuring that competition and challenges are available for them here. We need to cater for our Olympic athletes at home and not force them abroad. I understand Sport Ireland has issued a decree that any athletes who travel abroad will be penalised. That is really unfair. A recent survey carried out by the Japan Association of Athletics Federations showed that 571,000 athletes and 98,000 officials and staff took part in 787 races and track meetings in that country from 1 July to 4 October, resulting in only one case of someone involved contracting Covid-19 in the following two weeks. An athletics event can be held with fewer than 50 people at a facility at any one time. That would provide qualification opportunities. These are skilled people who conduct events on road tracks and indoor tracks. It only requires approval from Sport Ireland to enable them to do so. An event can be done simply and can provide an opportunity for athletes to qualify for international competition."	spk_429

It is important to have this discussion. Like everyone interested in sport, I am enjoying the GAA championship. Credit needs to go to the GAA for having managed to organise a championship in a year when there are so many challenges. There are over 60 recognised sports national governing bodies, NGBs, under the umbrella of Sport Ireland, all of which have elite sportspeople. Many such sportspeople have contacted me to express their concern that they cannot compete while the GAA has been able to. There is a sense that there is one door into the Minister with responsibility for sports for the GAA and another door that all the other sports have to squeeze through. The Olympics are coming next year and many of those who will be competing are not able to compete, train and practice. Undoubtedly, this will impact their preparations. Basketball, tennis, athletics, hockey and many other sports feel they are getting shafted by this Government. It should not come down to who is the best at lobbying. It should be decided on the basis of science and decisions should be determined by evidence-based information. If that information is available, it must be communicated to the various sports clubs and NGBs. The GAA is a fantastic organisation and does wonderful work around the country at many levels, including community level. It does so much good work around mental health issues and, of course, sport itself. However, there is a sense among many other sports that the GAA is getting preferential treatment. I understand that some Olympic athletes may be considering travelling abroad in order to get the competition they need. Olympian Rob Heffernan highlighted recently that athletes going to the next Olympics cannot train and the Government does not consider these Olympians elite athletes. Therefore, they cannot compete in various competitions that they need to. They have world-class facilities in Ireland and that needs to be addressed. All sports should be treated equally, including hockey, tennis, basketball and athletics. The Government needs to widen the definition of what is elite.	spk_22

If this were true it would be very welcome, but unfortunately this is not the case. Last week the homeless day service, Mendicity Institution, provided concrete examples of three rough sleepers who were refused access to emergency accommodation. They were told they were ineligible for homeless accommodation simply because they had no local connection. We must remember none of us is ineligible from being homeless. A number of times the Taoiseach has said there is plenty of capacity. While this may be true, it is of little use for those who are new to Dublin. Many people arrive in Dublin from Cork, Galway or Leitrim for complex reasons and they should not be turned away because local authorities cannot work together. It is not as if hostels are like palaces. They can be hostile places for vulnerable people. One rough sleeper told me recently that it can be like placing a lamb in a room among wolves. It is important to acknowledge that staff in the hostels do great work in difficult circumstances, but the facilities they have to work with are challenging to say the least. The State has a duty of care to our homeless whether they have a local connection or not."	spk_249

Scoliosis is a painful and disabling condition that impacts the child and the family. Sophie Redmond is 11 years old and has scoliosis. She also has issues with her knee ligaments. I was lucky enough to meet Sophie yesterday, along with her little brother, Tyler, her father, Eric, and her mother, Sam. Sophie is like a little unicorn, bringing smiles and colour wherever she goes. Recovery from any operation to straighten the spine will require walking. However, because of Sophie's knee ligament issue she will need to have a knee operation first, which will take time to recover from. It is vital that Sophie's knees are operated on so that she will be ready for the time-sensitive scoliosis operation. Sophie cannot cross the street unattended because of the fear that her knees might buckle, causing her to fall in the middle of the road. As a result of health system failures her spine is pressing into her lungs and pelvis. She has difficulty breathing as a result. Sophie is an 11 year old in a rapid growth phase. How bad will the Government let Sophie get? Will she be permanently physically and mentally damaged? No one can say that Sophie's condition is not impacting negatively on her mental health. Children with scoliosis cannot thrive while they are in discomfort and pain. This is a time when they are young and developing and should be thriving. An 11 year old should be physically active and enjoying the outdoors. Sophie does not want to do physical exercise because of her condition and she increasingly lacks confidence. Her confidence is taking a beating and she is constantly afraid of hurting herself. Sophie is living in fear. She and her family are prisoners of the public health system which has failed her. The surgeries Sophie requires must be carried out in a children's hospital, as she needs specialised paediatric equipment and admittance to a children's intensive care unit, ICU. Sophie will be left crippled. If this happens, it will be on the heads of this Government and this Minister. Covid-19 cannot be used as an excuse. The Minister for Health clearly stated that he was ashamed of the waiting list for scoliosis patients. In 2018, the then Minister for Health said that no child would be on a scoliosis waiting list for more than four months.  Is the Minister of State ashamed that children like Sophie and other scoliosis patients have to wait so long for their surgery? Sophie is not a unique case.

Like many other children, Sophie suffers from 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. This is a disorder caused when a small part of chromosome 22 is missing. This deletion results in the poor development of several body systems. The effects on every child are different. This can cause mental health issues for one child and chest or heart issues for another. Many children can have this syndrome without even knowing they have it. This adds to the problem. Many children with scoliosis also suffer from 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. It complicates their condition and adds to the urgency of treating them.It is not just spinal surgery they need; very often they require a whole suite of surgeries, operations and treatments.

Earlier today I talked to Tommy Nolan from Pearse Street who said his heart was broken from applying for jobs. It is demoralising for him. He knows he is being rejected for jobs because he is 64 years of age. At a time when citizens should be able to take the foot off the gas, this Government wants them to sign on the dole.It is a charade and the Government is forcing older people to take part in it. To make matters worse, the Government wants them to take part in it for less money than they would get in their pensions. Talk about rubbing salt in their wounds. If people want to retire at 65 or 66 then that should be their choice and they should be allowed take into consideration their physical and mental health and family circumstances. They must also have the choice to work on if they wish. Dr. Tony Fahey, professor of social policy at UCD, raised the issue of home ownership and pension poverty in November 2018. He wrote: Householders aged 25-34 had a high level of home ownership for their age in 1991 (69%), but today that proportion has fallen to just 30% ... [Among] those aged 35-44, home ownership has fallen from 82% in 1991 to 62% today. If this growth in private rentals continues in its current form [which it has since Dr. Fahey wrote this], it is likely to cause many young adults to be worse off than their parents as far as housing is concerned.He also made the point that the social welfare system in Ireland is based on the assumption that pensioners do not have to pay rent and do not have significant mortgage repayments. Bearing in mind Dr. Fahey's comments two years ago and the current generation not being able to purchase houses or purchasing them later in life, these people will have to pay rent or mortgages out of their pensions, something the current crop of pensioners does not have to do. 	spk_276

I seek leave to introduce the Bill, which comes about because the scrapping of height guidelines by the previous Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government means there is a lacuna in legislation. Previously, any site that was 0.1 ha or smaller was exempt from the requirement to transfer units to the local authority for housing. Small sites which were just for developing four or five homes were exempt from providing public housing. I do not think there was any issue with this. The Bill will remove this exemption by the deletion of section 97 subsection (3B) of the Planning and Development Act 2000. This Bill is being introduced because planning has been granted for a development on York Road, Ringsend, for a seven-storey apartment block. This development is very much out of character with the street, where the average home comprises a one, two or three-storey building. Having been granted permission for seven storeys, the developer has now reapplied for planning to change the build to a 15-storey apartment block with almost 50 new homes and no public housing. This has understandably angered the local community. Ringsend is an area that has a considerable need for social and affordable housing, as is the case in communities right across the inner city. Two and three generations of families are living in two and three-bedroom flats and towering beside these families, a developer is trying to avoid his obligation to provide social housing.  The community has developed and worked on this area. It is an attractive area with parks, sports clubs and community facilities. Developers are now swooping in on the back of the fantastic work that the community has done over the years to make Ringsend an attractive area in which to live. Those developers are going to maximise their profits and avoid doing anything for the community. They will just make money for the investors. The developers will promote and market this development using all the facilities that the community has fought hard to build over the decades. At the same time, they are avoiding providing housing in the area, which has a real need for social housing. Ringsend needs to have a local area plan developed or the area will continue to have developer-led housing and community development. Across the inner city, many working families are being locked out of home ownership. The cost of a one-bedroom home is now running at €422,000 in Ringsend. That is far from affordable. I know that in other areas in the inner city, developers are looking for small plots of land and will be going higher and higher while, at the same time, avoiding the provision of social housing. Google and Facebook have come in, are buying up properties and driving many of the long-established and working families from the area. Long-time residents have an issue with affordability, If these gaps in legislation are not sealed, developers will be able to avoid providing any public housing. The numbers on the social housing list are increasing daily and without public housing, these communities will become increasingly fragmented. Developers will be able to slip through the fence and avoid providing housing where there are small plots of land unless this Bill is passed. This is not only a Ringsend issue because it will happen right across the city and country unless the gap in legislation is filled. This Bill will do that.	spk_113

Chris Andrews	44	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2020-10-23	dail	33	 Level 5 Response to Covid-19: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_14	I want to put on the record that the decision last night by the Government to seal the records of the survivors of the mother and baby homes was both sad and shameful. It will go down as one of the most uncaring acts by this Government in the lifetime of this Dáil. History will not look kindly on this Government. With regard to Covid-19, reducing teaching staff while increasing class sizes to more than 30 students is not only a disgraceful move by the Department of Education it is also reckless. The reduction of the four first class groups to three in St. Louis Infant School, in Rathmines, will see the pupil-teacher ratio hit 32:1. A pupil-teacher ratio of that size is unacceptable in the middle of a pandemic. The Government gave a commitment in its programme for Government to reduce class sizes, not drive them up higher. Aside from the negative effects of such a ratio during normal times, to increase those classes to more than 30 students during the pandemic and a level 5 lockdown is a reckless move by the Department of Education. Rathmines has one of the highest 14-day Covid-19 incidence rates in Dublin. St. Louis Infant School appealed this decision but the board of appeal ruled against it. In the ruling it cited that the board could consider only criteria which were drawn up pre-Covid, therefore, none of the real concerns relating to the increase in class sizes during the pandemic could be considered. We are not living in normal times. The board of appeal must be able to take into account this pandemic and the impact its decisions may have on the health and well-being of those children, their teachers and their families. The Minister must reverse this decision and bring commonsense to the situation. She must prevent the pupil-teacher ratio rising during the pandemic. When the level changes from 3 to 4 or down to 2, there will be confusion about who can play sport and the facilities and shops that can remain open. However, we have a situation where off-licences can remain open but gyms must close. Why are off-licences deemed to be more essential than gyms or playing golf? The closure of gyms is confusing. For the past 40 years, the first thing one sees when one walks into a gym is a bottle of disinfectant and the blue paper for customers to wipe down the machines they have used.Sweating is not a new concept in gyms. They are designed to operate safely in these conditions. Under health and safety guidelines, a treadmill must have a minimum of 1.5 m of space behind it in case someone falls off, so social distancing is built in. Gyms are designed for social distancing and gym etiquette revolves around good hygiene. Gyms have done everything that has been asked of them. Every gym I have encountered has introduced extra cleaning, more distance between machines and has done anything else that has been asked of it. Gyms are so important to our physical and mental health, yet they have to close. Mental health services are stretched to the limit so gyms and sport are more important than ever in the personal battle against anxiety and depression. The make-up of the return to sport expert group is much too narrow. This group has representatives from the GAA, soccer and rugby, which is right and proper, and beyond that there are three members from the Department responsible for sport and five from Sport Ireland. Where is the diversity? Where is the voice on that group for tennis, hockey, golf, athletics and swimming? The basis for decisions should not be a secret. We need transparency and clarity on gyms and that is not forthcoming. Why can the Government not sit down, produce a clear and concise rationale for the closure of gyms and sports like golf and tennis and explain it to the public? We deserve to know.	spk_129

There is not enough of it. There is not enough social or affordable housing nationally, but in Ringsend, Pearse Street and York Street in particular, and in Dublin 2, 4 and 8 more generally, the lack of housing is particularly acute. Flat complexes in Ringsend such as Whelan House, O'Rahilly House, George Reynolds House and Canon Mooney Gardens are no longer fit for purpose. They need comprehensive regeneration and investment, not a facelift. The time for carrying out minor works has long passed. We need energy-efficient modern homes that can house working families. We do not need small flats that are riddled with dampness or overcrowded and unhealthy for young families. The recent budget trumpeted its commitment to affordable homes, yet residents of Ringsend village still have no clarity as to whether there will be affordable homes on the glass bottle site. The Government needs to give certainty to the Irish Glass Bottle site housing action group and the residents of Ringsend who have fought every step of the way to ensure that the glass bottle site is developed in the interests of those currently unable to get on the property ladder. Patsy, Susan, Richie, Kevin, Tom, Joe and Christine, to name but a few of the glass bottle site housing action group, have kept the fight for affordable homes at the top of the agenda. In 2017, Dublin City Council and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government agreed to fund 650 affordable homes on the glass bottle site in addition to the public housing promised, yet there is still no clarity as to whether they will be delivered and no certainty that they will be affordable. It has been suggested that the so-called affordable housing cost will be between €350,000 to €400,000 per home. How can anyone claim that is truly affordable? Ordinary working families in Ringsend will not be able to afford €350,000 or €400,000. The homes need to be genuinely affordable and no costlier than €230,000 in order for anyone to get even close to being able to afford them. We need to know what the Government deems to be affordable and to have direct intervention from the Minister and the Department. Only €110 million was allocated for affordable housing in the recent budget. The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, still has not reached a commercial agreement with Dublin City Council. The Minister needs to intervene to ensure that affordable homes will be delivered on the glass bottle site. Significant public funding is being invested to ensure that the glass bottle site will be developed. Construction of public bridges, and of infrastructure to allow the homes to be built on the glass bottle site, is being funded by the public purse. We cannot allow developers to benefit from this investment without ensuring that affordable and public housing is built on the site. I assure the Minister of State that the residents of Ringsend will not roll over. They will resist any attempts to cut the provision of affordable housing on the glass bottle site, even if that takes direct action. I will stand shoulder to shoulder with them in Ringsend and Pearse Street. All the residents will resist any attempt to cut social and public housing on the glass bottle site.	spk_299

What has been happening recently, and accelerating over the past number of years, is that the likes of Facebook, Google and their senior management teams have been buying homes in the Ringsend area. Prices are huge there now. There is a small one-bedroom cottage in Ringsend for which people are being asked to pay more than €400,000. This is not affordable. The long-term community in Ringsend is being forced to move out and it is having a negative impact on the community at large. The Capital Dock building, which the Minister of State has probably seen in Ringsend, did not provide any social housing in the area because developers bought their way out of providing Part V social housing by providing the housing in Rialto. That is great for Rialto and in the general context of the housing list and housing crisis but the difficulty is there are no new social and affordable homes being provided in Ringsend. Prices are so high that the council stated that it cannot afford to pay the prices developers are requesting. Ringsend gets left behind and gentrification continues. Working families are being left behind so affordable homes not only on the old Irish Glass Bottle site but elsewhere are really important. We need public housing on public land and affordable housing to ensure people get homes and do not have to move too far from their community.

I find it hard to believe anyone in this House could believe that co-living is the right way to develop our housing stock. Co-living is not cheap. It costs around €1,300 per month for what is, effectively, a car parking space, with 40 people sharing a kitchen. At the best of times, co-living is not suitable but at the height of a pandemic, it is completely unacceptable. These are tenements for the future. They are certainly not boutique living, as they were previously described by a Fine Gael Minister with responsibility for housing. The cost of land gets pushed up because developers use the site to wedge in bedrooms. There are developments on the old Kiely's site in Donnybrook and in Harold's Cross. Right across the city, hotels, aparthotels and student accommodation are springing up everywhere without any issues. For working families and homeless families and individuals, however, homes are not being built and those that are built are not affordable. Clearly, something is wrong when we cannot build housing that does not address the needs of the housing crisis. We have a developer-led housing policy. We have 4,000 co-living beds in the system because developers will maximise their profits at the expense of families and individuals who are being forced to live in completely overcrowded accommodation. We need to repeal the Planning and Development Act that gives the Minister the power to introduce mandatory planning guidelines without a vote in the Oireachtas. This provision was introduced by the Labour Party in 2016 and needs to go. Sinn Féin would also repeal the mandatory planning guidelines introduced by Fine Gael not long ago. It should be noted that these are the same guidelines and regulations that have allowed developers to chance their arm to try to build 15-storey buildings in Ringsend next to one-storey and two-storey schools. Thankfully, Dublin City Council has rejected this. It is important that An Bord Pleanála does the same. We need affordable homes and public housing on public land, not co-living developments.	spk_398

I do not think we ever really realised how important sport is. For those watching and participating in sport it has been immensely important in so many ways. However, the public health guidelines for team sports are very unclear, as Deputy McAuliffe mentioned. There is much confusion and unanswered questions for clubs playing soccer. I raised this issue with the Taoiseach yesterday and his sidestep was very impressive but that was all. I got no real clarity. Different sporting organisations are interpreting the rules differently. It is possible to play or train with a rugby or GAA club but not a soccer club. St. Pat's CYFC women's team cannot play their matches but the same players can play for their GAA club. Juvenile soccer players cannot train with their clubs unless they are part of the elite structure yet the same kids can train with their rugby or GAA teams. These examples are replicated across Dublin to Aungier Celtic, Liffey Wanderers, Kilbarrack and Clontarf. Right across Dublin clubs are being excluded from playing their sport. The Government has taken a back seat on this and has only added to the lack of clarity around public health rules for national sporting organisations. The wording of the guidelines is not clear enough. If it was, all sports would be treated equally. The Government needs to give clear guidance to sports organisations. Why can amateur GAA sports clubs and amateur rugby clubs play while amateur soccer is excluded? No one is willing to answer this question. Playing sports should be open to everybody. Thousands of kids are missing out on football and it is impacting on their mental health. Covid does not attack amateur soccer players and leave amateur GAA and rugby players alone. All sports clubs, whether rugby, soccer, GAA or hockey, should be open or closed at the same time. All sports must be treated equally.	spk_221

This is probably forgotten when people look at its skyline and see sparkling six, eight and ten storey apartment buildings and plenty of cranes. These new buildings have state-of-the-art technology and all the mod cons, but that is in stark contrast to Dublin City Council's housing in Pearse House, Glover's Court and most of the council's flat complexes. The Googles and Facebooks are pushing people out of their communities. The flat complexes that I have mentioned and many more are almost like modern tenements, but our people deserve better. Bin storage areas are open and the competition between rats and seagulls is intense. If one wants to witness that struggle in bin storage areas, one need only go to Markievicz House, which is less than 1 km from here. Rats travel the flats without fear and, in some cases, have eaten into cars and done such damage that insurance companies have had to write off those cars. In what is not an unusual instance, rats found their way into a flat in Pearse House through the waste pipes, nested behind a wardrobe and ate the electrics at the back of the fridge and cooker at night. Flooding is a regular occurrence, sometimes with raw sewage. Regularly, raw sewage bursts into the balconies or courtyards from the old pipes. Mould is rampant in the flats, with some rooms being uninhabitable because of its extent. Residents' health is badly impacted because of this, but more often than not, the council just tells people to wipe the mould off with bleach and they will be grand. The council has lined stairwells with a lining that makes it almost impossible to sweep and is difficult to wash down. This was done without any consultation with residents. Canon Mooney Gardens in Ringsend faces a variety of issues that Dublin City Council has agreed to work on, but that work has stalled once again. In the 1930s and 1940s when many flat complexes were constructed, they were built to replace the slums across Dublin. They were built to a high standard and have lasted well, but they are no longer suitable for families. Herbert Simms, who was responsible for the design and construction of some 17,000 homes from 1932 to 1948 when the country was on its knees economically, saw the importance of public housing. We now need to see that same commitment from this Government in terms of investing in public housing stock.

Clearly, Dublin City Council is filling in the details, but it cannot do this without funding and a commitment. It is important that the Government commits to funding redevelopment projects. Pearse House is a large development of 370 flats and is experiencing many social as well as physical infrastructure issues. It needs to be regenerated. The people there have put up with terrible conditions. None of us here would live in the conditions to which they have been subjected. The Government needs to invest in this project as a matter of urgency. I welcome the Minister of State's comments. I will keep pushing him on more than just Pearse House. Right across the inner city, there are homes that need to be redeveloped. They are not up to modern standards and would not be acceptable in any other European city. They should not be accepted in Dublin. It is important that we invest in Pearse House and all those flat complexes that are in urgent need of regeneration.	spk_330

I was not sure where I was on the list. Sometimes I am never sure where I am. Before the summer recess I raised the serious health concerns of an 11-year-old scoliosis patient, Sophie Redmond, with the Taoiseach. Sophie is in need of urgent spinal surgery but she also desperately requires surgery on her knees. At the time, the Taoiseach mentioned the gravity of the situation and said he understood the time-sensitive nature of it. Sophie is no closer now to getting her surgery than when I raised the matter before the recess. I ask the Taoiseach not to forget about scoliosis patients and children such as Sophie Redmond. Will he make sure that somebody contacts her parents to ensure that her surgery, and surgeries similar to that, are carried out as a matter of urgency?	spk_82

It is a great honour and a huge responsibility. Early in the pandemic, front-line hospital staff in the Dublin City Council area were given free parking when they were near particular hospitals. This was a very fair and welcome gesture. This decision was made by the Government and Dublin City Council implemented it. This measure should be reintroduced while Dublin is in level 3. Given that teachers are now effectively front-line workers, this measure should be extended to them, specifically those working in schools that do not have parking. These are mainly inner-city schools and there are not many of them. They include CBS Westland Row, City Quay national school and a few others. Without teachers, the economy would be effectively closed now. Given that members of the public are being encouraged to use public transport, this measure would benefit a small number of schools in the inner city. Not many parking spaces are being used because of the reduction in traffic into the city. The loss of revenue would be small but the gesture would be big and appreciated by teachers. The Government should consider requesting Dublin City Council to give teachers in inner-city schools without parking on their premises a break. 	spk_250
Chris Andrews	44	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2020-09-22	dail	33	Community Safety and Fireworks: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_36	I welcome this motion put forward by my colleague, Deputy Ward. Two weeks ago, a young woman in the park in Ringsend was hit in the forehead by rocket. When I say there was a hole in her head, I am not exaggerating. It was horrendous. It was an image that could not be unseen and was hard to get out of one's mind. It was traumatic, I imagine, for the poor woman. This year, the community development section in Dublin City Council has not been able to plan community activities around Hallowe'en, as it has done in recent years. The fireworks seem to be particularly bad this year. They seem stronger in their power, the people using them are being more reckless and they started to let off these fireworks in June and July. I do not think it is a coincidence that we have a particular problem this year. The Garda used to have a community schools programme but that is no longer running. That would be an effective way of addressing this issue, although it might not be as trendy or fashionable as looking for social media influencers.  Dublin City Council community development section has developed amazing projects in recent years. Those projects have effectively turned what in many ways were no-go areas around Hallowe'en into locations with really exciting and enjoyable activities, in which there was major engagement by local communities. It is also important to recognise and acknowledge the positive work community gardaí do. I mentioned the schools programme but I know that the Cabbage Garden, not too far from here, at Kevin Street, was a no-go area for years, especially in the run-up to and during Hallowe'en. The work of the community development team in Dublin City Council and the community gardaí, however, made last year a real success, turned around all the antisocial behaviour, drug dealing and trouble for residents and made Hallowe'en a very enjoyable experience. The same goes for Ringsend, where Dublin City Council developed a great community project that really made a difference to everyone in the area.  To offer something positive and a possible solution, therefore, I believe that if Dublin City Council's community development team had the funding, it would be possible to ensure that more great projects could happen and that problems, such as the events we have been experiencing this year, would not be so prevalent. The community projects developed by Dublin City Council must be resourced. The inner city has been forgotten about for long enough and we must provide proper resources to that area. 	spk_278

I have not had an opportunity to do so before now and I wish her well in that journey. It is going to be a challenging one and it is very important for us all that she succeeds. Earlier, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, mentioned the words ""solidarity"" and ""confidence"". Not too far from here, however, St. Mary's nursing home, on the Merrion Road, is being closed. The closure was announced in June and at present, 20 very vulnerable individuals with disabilities live there. Many of the residents have been there for up to 50 or 60 years. They are surrounded by friends and the staff have, effectively, become family. The staff recently received a Covid-19 hero award from the former Lord Mayor, Tom Brabazon. The nursing home is free from Covid-19. In the middle of a pandemic and with all the issues concerning nursing homes, it seems bizarre to be closing a nursing home that is free of Covid-19. St. Mary's should not be closed but kept open and invested in. The nursing home is already 80% funded by the State and the HSE. The State must intervene and invest in these vital facilities. I visited the nursing home on the Merrion Road today and I met the staff and residents. Several of the residents had one request, and that was for the Minister for Health to meet them. I noticed earlier that the Minister for Education and Skills met some sexual abuse survivors. I ask that the same courtesy be afforded to the residents of St. Mary's nursing home by the Minister for Health. Will the Minister meet the staff and residents of St. Mary's nursing home? It is not much to ask for and it is important that St. Mary's is funded and not closed. "	spk_299

Last night, several Deputies mentioned issues relating to conditions, training and pay in the Defence Forces. It is in the context of conditions that I raise the issue of 12 homes in Cathal Brugha Barracks in Rathmines. An example is one 70-year-old woman who has lived there for 47 years. Her husband was a member of the Defence Forces and her son, who has also been an active member of the Defence Forces for the past 20 years, lives with her. They are referred to by the Defence Forces as ""overholders"" even though they have not been asked to leave or vacate the premises. That woman and her son have asked to buy the property to give them some sense of security because there is none for them now. The Defence Forces have always refused to sell, mainly for legal reasons. A similar case occurred when a family tried on three occasions to buy their home, but the Defence Forces withdrew from the agreements each time. What way is that to treat our Defence Forces' members, our veterans and their families? Members of the Defence Forces are already badly paid and operate in difficult and challenging conditions. Twelve families have been left in this situation of having no security regarding their homes and, to compound the issue, the Defence Forces will not carry out any repairs to these 12 homes. In addition, permission has also not been given for the residents to carry out repairs. The result is that those houses are crumbling around the residents, and it is unfair to allow people to live in this type of limbo, with no security or clarity regarding what will happen to them or their children in the future. When we talk about conditions, therefore, it is important that we put in place measures to give security to families such as those I mentioned. The legal issues need to be resolved, so I ask the Minister to consider the situation of these residents in the context of conditions and pay for members of the Defence Forces and their families. This is an important matter."	spk_354

In many cases, they are like modern-day tenements. Glistening ten and 12-storey buildings are going up around flat complexes which have dirty stairwells and are not properly maintained. In some complexes, the wiring is poor and flats are flooding. There are infestations of rats across flat complexes in Dublin city, something that would not be accepted anywhere else. Dublin City Council is not willing to do enough to address this. It is unhygienic. Bins are poorly stored. These are important issues for people living in the flats. I understand the complexity around housing but the reality is that many people living in flat complexes have been left behind and it is important to address the issues I have raised.  I appreciate the forbearance of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and wish the Minister the best of luck. It is a big challenge, responsibility and honour. I give him my best wishes.	spk_44

It is a great honour and responsibility. Trying to get the balance right between saving lives and opening up the economy is going to be difficult and challenging, and we have to strike that balance. Microenterprises and SMEs have experienced shocks that are putting their very existence in doubt. I heard John Moran on ""Morning Ireland"" last week or the week before say that €6.5 billion of funding for SMEs was announced, but only €100 million was drawn down. As my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, said yesterday, many of these supports are inaccessible. Businesses have contacted me about the restart grant, which has been mentioned a number of times this morning and was mentioned in yesterday's debate. In many cases, they were approved for these grants weeks ago but have still not heard anything. This will soon become known as the Government of announcements because it makes announcement after announcement with very little delivery on these announcements. This will undermine the July stimulus plan and the announcement made on that. I will give an example of an announcement on which there has been no delivery. In early May, the then Minister announced a rates waiver for certain businesses, which would allow them to claim back the rates they had claimed over the same period last year. Unfortunately, SMEs have heard nothing more to date. I have been contacted by a number of small business owners who are all in the same boat. They all have a serious shortage of cash flow and anyone who has been involved in business will know that cash is crucial to any small business. They need this rates waiver. They need the breathing space. However, the council has not processed the waiver. It does not know the criteria and is waiting on the Department to provide instruction. The problem for small businesses is that they are still waiting. For two months, SMEs have been waiting. For two months, the council has been waiting to hear from the Government. Without this support and other supports, the businesses in question may have to close. The margin is that fine. They are balancing on a knife edge and they need everything that they can get. Last week, I asked the Tánaiste the following questions:Can he say why, two months on, the Government has not informed Dublin City Council of the three-month rates waiver for SMEs? Why has the largest council [Dublin City Council] ... not been updated on a scheme announced two months ago? Will he confirm that there will be no rowing back on the waiver scheme and that SMEs will receive it?Last week, in response to those questions, the Tánaiste stated:We informed the world that rates were being waived for companies that had to close for that three-month period. We ... have to consider extending that waiver. I do not know why Dublin City Council has not been formally informed but I will check that out.They are still waiting. They still have not heard anything. The SMEs have not heard anything. The local authorities have not heard anything. That was a week ago. I have been in touch with the chief executive of Dublin City Council and he has informed me that the introduction of the rates waiver is awaiting decision by the Department on the details of the scheme. Despite intensive pressure from the local authority sector, no circular has been issued with details of that scheme. It seems that those in this Government and that which preceded it have been making announcements and then sitting on their hands. What is happening in the Department that the Tánaiste does not know that the rates waiver has not been delivered two months after it was announced? As already stated, the Tánaiste indicated last week that he announced to the world the rates waiver scheme. However, the Department has done nothing to make sure that it is delivered. This delay in deciding on the scheme is unhelpful to both SMEs and local authorities. The local authorities need to know the criteria for the waiver. They need to know who is eligible and who is not. They need to know because they themselves need to budget. I ask that the Tánaiste and the Minister of State ensure that the local authorities are notified of the criteria for the rates waiver scheme and that it is issued as a matter of urgency. Otherwise, the Government will become known as the Government for announcements."	spk_10

I would like to congratulate the Tánaiste on his appointment. It is a huge honour and a huge responsibility. I wish him success in his new role and his new Department. Trying to get the balance right between saving lives and opening up the economy will be very difficult and challenging. It is in all of our interests that he succeeds. I heard John Moran on ""Morning Ireland"" today. He said that €6.5 billion in funding for SMEs was announced but only €1 billion has been drawn down. There is a big gap between the ability to make announcements and the ability to deliver. This is something the Minister's Department will need to address as a matter of urgency for the sake of all the SMEs in the country. Grants rather than loans need to be given to SMEs. There has been some discussion around that issue. Giving loans to SMEs at this point is like throwing a block of cement at a drowning man. They are on their knees, many will go out of business and they do not need extra weight. They need less weight and they need support. I will give a specific example of the gap between the announcements of aid and the actual delivery. In early May there was an announcement of a rates waiver. I have been contacted by many small businesses in Dublin Bay South, which are all in the same boat. They have a serious shortage of cash flow, which is crucial to any small business. They have contacted Dublin City Council and have received replies similar to the following:As you know, there was a Government announcement on 2 May 2020 of a potential three-month waiver of rates for certain businesses but unfortunately we have heard no more to date so the full 2020 charge is still on your account. You have two choices for the restart of your deductions. You can either start paying the current balance of the account from July and if you are entitled to a waiver we can reduce deductions for the remainder of the year, or we can temporarily ignore three-twelfths of the charge and start taking a lower amount from July. However, if you are not entitled to a waiver, that means that deductions will increase for the remainder of the year. Please let me know what you would prefer to do.The reply mentioned the restart grant, which was mentioned previously. It stated:Just an update in relation to the restart grant. I believe they started processing the applications last week with the first payments to be made this week. [That has not yet happened.] If you have not already applied for this grant, it may be worth your while to apply if you are eligible.SMEs have been waiting for the rates waiver scheme for two months. Many businesses are on their knees, as the Tánaiste knows. Many may open and this funding will buy them some extra time and keep them in the game. Without this funding and these grants, they will have to close. It is that tight for many businesses which are balancing on a knife edge. I appreciate that Deputy Varadkar is new to the post of Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment but he was Taoiseach of the previous Government. Can he say why, two months on, the Government has not informed Dublin City Council of the three-month rates waiver for SMEs? Why has the largest council in the country not been updated on a scheme announced two months ago? Will he confirm that there will be no rowing back on the waiver scheme and that SMEs will receive it?

Chris Andrews	44	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2020-06-17	dail	33	Supporting Inclusion and Combating Racism in Ireland: Statements	dbsect_2	The unjustifiable murder of George Floyd has sparked a long overdue conversation on an important issue, that is, racism. While prejudice, discrimination and antagonism are evidently indisputable in the US, the Irish are not as innocent as we make ourselves out to be. In recent months, I have been disappointed to hear people saying that racism does not exist in Ireland. Have they forgotten about the thousands of people who are living in direct provision and are marginalised in those centres? Have they forgotten those who are forced to share rooms with people who are usually strangers? This was even before we add concerns about Covid-19 to the equation. Have they forgotten that asylum seekers are refused jobs and spend years in centres only to be deported? Have they forgotten that some people who are born and raised in Ireland are not granted automatic citizenship due to racist beliefs and fears?Have they forgotten about the thousands of black citizens who are told to go back to their own countries every day? These are only a few examples. My point is that injustice, inequality and racism are prevalent in Ireland. I encourage everybody to continue to support this fight for justice. We must continue to educate ourselves, campaign, donate, sign petitions and get involved in politics and advocacy long after the hashtag ends. This is not just a trend on Twitter or Instagram, it is real life and it is the difference between life and death for many, as we have seen. If we have to start somewhere, why should it not be in our own country? Let us abolish direct provision. What is outlined in this regard in the programme for Government is a positive step forward. It is really important that we monitor progress on that commitment. The direct provision centres deny asylum seekers basic human rights while, at the same time, isolating them from the rest of the community. It is wrong to preach about racism and injustice in Ireland when, in practice, we are doing very little to change it. We must stand in solidarity with those who are being discriminated against and we must fight institutional racism together. It is not enough to be not racist; we must be anti-racist and we must act now to end direct provision. There is no strength without unity. Those words give me hope because they were written and sent to me by my daughter recently. Young people really give me hope for the future and a belief that we will defeat racism. When we acknowledge that we want our citizens to be anti-racist, it is, of course, understandable. It is something that we must strive for. However, in the international arena, Ireland is not anti-racist. We are not anti-racist when we refuse to stand up to the racist state that is Israel. We must be anti-racist and challenge the apartheid, terror state that is Israel.	spk_8

We must challenge the annexation of more Palestinian land. How can we say we want to end racism if we do not stand up to racist Israel? I have to think that we did not want to upset anyone in advance of the United Nations Security Council vote. Not including Senator Frances Black's Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 in the programme for Government is a huge setback and a kick in the teeth for Palestinians and all those who campaigned in respect of that legislation. This was an opportunity to stand up to state racism but, instead, we threw the Palestinians to the wolves. Finally, I welcome the commitment to examine the introduction of a new ground of discrimination based on socio-economically disadvantaged status under the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts. However, it seems vague and not very definitive. I mention this because, increasingly, there is an intersection between class and race.

Prior to the pandemic, the League of Ireland and the clubs were making really positive progress. The underage structures were developing really well and were coming on.One could start to see the benefits at underage international level. The women's football was developing very strongly as well. One element was the active engagement of clubs with community projects. It is hard to match the level of community activity in which clubs were involved. My club, Shamrock Rovers, is very much involved with local community projects and is at the heart of much of the good that happens in that community. For example, Shamrock Rovers was very supportive of Gaza Kids to Dublin. It is also supportive of the Homeless Period Ireland project and its end period poverty campaign. This community engagement is reflected in all the clubs across the country. The clubs are more than just football clubs because they are at the heart of the community. With the Covid-19 pandemic the clubs and the league are effectively on a ventilator in ICU. What they need is oxygen, and in many ways the oxygen is cash flow. The only way for League of Ireland clubs to generate cash flow is to get people coming through the turnstiles. They will not survive without that. They need a great deal of support. The FAI does not have enough money, nor does the league. I understand that the meeting today with the clubs did not go well. There was much despondency among the clubs leaving it. There is great concern that the existence of many clubs may be in question.

There are many opportunities as we move out of the pandemic, but in order to achieve that we must make choices because it is about choices. For instance, we must choose a one-tier health system, which will allow equal access for everybody so that access is not determined by the size of one's wallet but by one's medical need. We must also choose a housing policy that will tackle homelessness and the lack of social and affordable housing. In my constituency of Dublin Bay South the need for housing is at a crisis point. We really need to make the choice to tackle such issues. We must deliver a childcare system that works for ordinary families and that is affordable for people. We also need to deliver the change the electorate called for and voted for in the recent election. Sinn Féin will advocate for change and for a fairer and more equal society. We will advocate that no one is left behind. The pension age has been mentioned quite a bit recently and many mixed messages are coming from the Government on it.

I have had extensive engagement with them. I know they have been working hard and effectively in difficult circumstances and I am keen to acknowledge that. An issue of concern to me arose early on Monday morning when a landlord arrived in with a crew of men and dismantled a small storage area of a coffee shop in Ranelagh. The landlord threw all the products and stock out onto the footpath. It is worth recording that the coffee shop has been really generous in offering those over 65 years and front-line workers free coffee.The shop in question, Nick's Coffee, is an integral part of the community. We cannot let ourselves become a society where this sort of behaviour becomes acceptable. One must ask how any human can carry out those sorts of actions in a health crisis when everybody is struggling. It seems big landlords are being prioritised over the local economy, which is a real concern for people. Our economy will be a long time recovering if landlords are going to behave in this way. It is in everybody's interest that we work together and the Government must intervene to stop landlords acting like this. Something must be done to ensure landlords cannot do this. In the George's Street Arcade, the landlord has a number of tenants but has given comfort to them. Landlords can work with commercial tenants and be sensible about it. It is a credit to landlords in the George's Street Arcade that this is being done. Does the Minister condemn the actions of the landlord in question, as it is important to state clearly that the Government will not accept this sort of behaviour? Assuming the Minister will condemn the action, will she consider bringing forward measures to give protection to commercial tenants like that? I ask her to bring forward legislation that will afford commercial tenants the same protection that residential tenants have. Is that something she is considering?	spk_300

Art, music and literature have given us all a lift in these uncertain times. The arts have lifted our collective spirits. One initiative that I have seen that has given me and everybody a lift has been the art painted by children. It is placed in windows, whether in Portobello or Pearse Street. The current crisis is an especially worrying time for artists and their dependants. We have never needed the arts more than we do now. The level of funding to assist artists announced recently is extremely disappointing and I urge a significant increase in funds for the arts community. One initiative I have seen develop is the artist support pledge. When an artist sells a piece of work for €200 or less, and then reach €1,000 in sales, that artist will commit to buying another artist's work for €200. I think this is a win-win for everybody and it will certainly encourage new artists to come forward. Will the Minister and the Department consider supporting and promoting this artist-led initiative?I am also interested in hearing the Minister's view on the current state of Project Ireland 2040, in particular the capital investment in culture, language and heritage. The Minister will be aware that these investments are outlined in the document, Investing in Our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027. Many of the national cultural institutions are in historical buildings and they also happen to be in my constituency of Dublin Bay South. We have the National Gallery, National Archives, National Concert Hall and, in Kildare Street, we have the National Library and National Museum. Will the earmarked capital investment of €460 million in the national cultural institutions go ahead as planned? What is the Minister's current expectation regarding these projects and a timeline for them? Will she consider bringing forward the €460 million investment to act as a stimulus for economic recovery? Will the Minister guarantee that any capital investment in culture, language and heritage will be climate-proofed?	spk_262

Chris Andrews	44	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2020-05-07	dail	33	Covid-19 (Health): Statements	dbsect_6	"The Government has made many big announcements and big commitments in the last few months but these announcements and commitments are not being reflected in action on the ground. A case in point is the announcement about testing. We were told we are to get 100,000 per week and we are also told it will be 15,000 per day. Of course, while this sounds great, in practice, the situation is very different on the ground. I was contacted recently by a person who had to wait 22 days to get the test results, and that was after chasing up the hospital to get those results. Others are waiting 12 or 15 days for their results. As testing figures seem unclear and not very exact, I wonder how many results a day are being communicated to those tested.It seems that it could be different. It is probably a better way of measuring how effective testing is. Another big announcement was that the State had done a deal with private hospitals. This sounded fantastic but the reality was different. I have been contacted by staff in private hospitals who have said those hospitals were significantly under utilised over the past eight weeks. When we consider that almost 50% of those who have died from the Covid virus were resident in nursing homes we must ask why the hospitals have been so under utilised. The son of a nursing home resident contacted me to ask whether the Government had abandoned the nursing homes. Unfortunately, the answer seems to be ""yes"". In this context, will the Minister commit to using all of the resources in the private hospitals to support nursing homes? Homecare workers are not required to wear masks, which has been mentioned. This is a real concern for many people who have vulnerable family members receiving support. It is also a concern for the homecare workers. A homecare worker may have to make up to 30 visits a day. Will the Minister state why masks are not required?"	spk_171

Pieta House does amazing work for mental health but, unfortunately, because of the postponement of the Darkness into Light walk it is down funding and needs to cut jobs and front-line counselling services. Pieta House has traditionally provided services where the HSE is weak. To ensure the vital services that Pieta House offers are maintained and the jobs are protected will the Minister intervene and work with it to ensure the vital services it offers are maintained and sustained over the coming months and years? The publication of a refreshed A Vision for Change is vital to develop a cohesive post-Covid-19 response plan for mental health.

While I do not wish to diminish the tragedy that is Idlib and Syria, I think it would be positive to hear the European Council support the case of Israel being referred to the ICC, where it is currently being considered. The ongoing attacks on Palestinian civilians, medical staff and journalists in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are unacceptable. EU support for the ICC to investigate Israel would be the humane and correct step to take.

I understand it has been proposed to set the licence for online betting at €5,000.  There is a danger this licence may facilitate cowboy online bookmakers from abroad who would come to and register in this country and signal on their websites they were registered and approved by the Irish system.  There is a danger of fraud being committed by Internet cowboy bookmakers who would do damage to Ireland's reputation.  Perhaps we should consider increasing that fee to €30,000 or €40,000, which would deter such bookmakers.  Those in the country who work under the licence in good faith would not have any difficulty in paying that, as I understand it.  We should consider increasing the €5,000 licence fee which would discourage the online cowboy bookmakers.	spk_264

Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-11-11	dail	30	Fifth Report of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security: Motion	dbsect_11	I thank Deputy Sargent for sharing time.  I commend the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security on its excellent work in producing its Bill.  It is heartening that Members from all parties worked together constructively on an issue of not only national but also global importance.  It would be nice to see the same sense of working towards the common good extended to other policy areas.The Bill produced by the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security has assigned responsibility for co-ordinating and enforcing action on climate change to the Department of the Taoiseach.  While I understand the reasoning behind this, as explained by the committee, I am not sure that the Department of the Taoiseach is the most appropriate office to drive such reform.  However, I agree that rather than responsibility being spread out among various Ministers and Departments, there should be a more centralised point of responsibility.  I welcome the proposal to establish an office of climate change and renewable energy, and a climate change commission.The current economic difficulties are not surprisingly the most pressing concern to every Member of this House and the public.  However, the interlinked issues of climate change and energy security are without doubt among the most pressing global issues of our time.  As a country we must work to reduce our emissions across every sector and play our part in ensuring security for future generations.  The impact of global warming was witnessed at first hand last year when we had an unprecedented amount of rainfall resulting in devastation for countless families across the country.  Rather than it being a freak event, experts at the time attributed it to the very real impact of climate change.  The devastation of last year's rainfall drove home the need for real action on this issue.  Last month it was reported that Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions had fallen for the first time in 20 years.  A number of factors contributed to this, including, primarily, the recession.  However, I have no doubt that measures taken to improve our efficiency have also contributed to this reduction.  Despite this dramatic reduction, Ireland's emissions are still 10% above our Kyoto target.  While I understand the work on the Government's climate change Bill is well advanced, I call for the heads of the Bill to be published as soon as possible.  This issue is simply too important to be delayed any longer and I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure the legislation proceeds at speed.	spk_585
Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-10-20	dail	30	Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Bill 2010: Second Stage	dbsect_24	"I thank Deputy O'Flynn for sharing his time with me.  This Bill amends existing legislation applying to the defence of the person and the person's home.  I commend the Minister on introducing this item of legislation, which is timely and welcome.  It builds on other welcome legislation.The Bill outlines what is meant by the dwelling, and provides when justifiable force, including lethal force, may be used against a person entering for criminal purposes.  It also states clearly that the occupier has no obligation to retreat from the dwelling.  In addition, it bars the taking of civil actions against occupiers who protect their dwellings and inflict injuries incidental to that.  That is a common sense measure.  The notion that someone who breaks into a home, having injured himself, can claim damages makes no sense.The right to feel safe in one's own home is a basic entitlement.  Article 40.5 of the Constitution states specifically: ""The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.""  The Constitution clearly states that our home is our castle and we should be allowed to protect it and defend it.  Unfortunately, this legislation is necessary.In recent years, a number of high profile incidents have increased the focus on this subject, most infamously the Nally case.  There has been a perception, somewhat unfairly, that the law in this area comes down more on the side of the people who perpetrate the crime of breaking into another person's home rather than those on whom the crime is committed.  The legislation clarifies the fact that the law is on the side of the wronged party and ensures that homeowners can be certain of their right to defend their dwellings without fear of civil action.I welcome the legislation and commend the Minister on the stance he has taken on the matter.  However, as I have stated previously there should be greater deterrents for the people who commit crimes, particularly against the elderly and vulnerable.  One such deterrent would be the introduction of mandatory sentences for burglary and aggravated burglary.  I accept that mandatory sentencing will not solve the underlying problems that cause people to commit crimes but it is my belief that the thought of going to prison for a set number of years would make many burglars think twice before they enter a property.According to recent statistics from the Central Statistics Office, there were 26,793 burglaries and related offences last year — an increase of 8.5% — while the annual increase in aggravated burglary offences, compared with 2008, was 11.7%.  Statistics show that Dublin is the worst affected area, with 32.7% of all burglaries.  In my constituency of Dublin South-East there was a spate of burglaries earlier this year in which elderly people were targeted in their homes.  Criminals took advantage of the lonely and isolated.  They preyed on the trusting nature of those homeowners by posing as council officials or other people on official business such as television licence inspectors or ESB meter readers.  While the Garda has been excellent in combating such crimes, providing people with checklists for home security and warning them not to trust anyone they do not know, it is an uphill battle due to the fact that many of the perpetrators serve only a few months in prison before being let out on the streets again to reoffend.I pay tribute to the former chief superintendent for the south Dublin area, John Twomey, who has been promoted to Assistant Garda Commissioner.  He was committed to community policing and drove on that agenda which has made a difference.  In the inner city I attend another forum he has set up with residents, public representatives, council officials and the Garda.  It has made a difference and improved matters to some extent.  It is not a magic wand but it has made a difference.  John Twomey deserves credit for his work, which no doubt has been recognised in his promotion.  I wish him well in his new post.I also welcome the appointment of the new chief superintendent, Michael O'Sullivan, whom I met last Friday at a community policing forum meeting which was very well attended by residents and the Garda.  The fact that he was present shows his personal commitment and the commitment of the Garda to community policing which has a significant impact on improving the quality of people's lives.  There is a considerable level of anti-social behaviour which might not fall into the criminal bracket but does constitute a real nuisance and has a negative impact on people's lives.  The community Garda section and the work of such people as Michael O'Sullivan has made a positive difference in my constituency.  The community is involved in making decisions.  Sometimes even explaining to residents why certain things cannot be done is of benefit.  The time given by the Garda to local community residents has made a difference.  I wish the new Assistant Garda Commissioner, John Twomey, well and the same to his replacement, chief superintendent, Michael O'Sullivan, in Pearse Street.  The area has had its difficulties over the years and of late the Garda has made a big effort to be involved and to build relationships with the local community.  That has been a positive development.Earlier this year the Attorney General asked the Law Reform Commission to consider the issue of mandatory sentencing, particularly for those who attack the vulnerable in society.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform said he was open minded on the subject of mandatory sentences and has not ruled them out, but he queried the need for them in view of the fact that a maximum sentence could apply, which is up to 14 years for burglary and a life sentence for aggravated burglary.  I am open to correction but the handing out of maximum sentences is not the norm for burglaries.  Until such time as the maximum sentence is handed down for aggravated burglaries we need to introduce mandatory sentencing for such crimes.The Bill ensures that those people who are in a position to protect their homes, if they wish to, can do so without fear of repercussion.  It also adopts the castle doctrine into Irish law, stating that a homeowner is not under a duty to retreat, which has not been clear up to this point.  In most cases of burglary the advice would be to get out of the way and leave them to it.  However, that is not acceptable.  A person should not have to retreat from his or her home, although it is probably wise to do so.  If a person defends his or her home, he or she should not end up as the victim.While I have spoken about my belief on the introduction of mandatory sentencing for burglary I accept that is not the only solution to the problem.  Funding and investment in youth training and programmes also need to be maintained in so far as possible in these challenging times to try to prevent those individuals most at risk of embarking on a life of crime from doing so.  I commend the work of the community groups in Dublin South-East, Pearse Street, Kevin Street and others across the constituency.  I support the work they do and the commitment they have shown.  I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister on its introduction."	spk_864

Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-07-08	dail	30	Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_41	"I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the Bill.  The term ""multi-unit development"" is used to describe a building comprising multiple residential properties that share certain physical areas, such as car parks, halls and gardens, and certain services, including security and waste disposal.  Notwithstanding Deputy Sargent's comments, the Bill will give home owners who live in multi-unit developments like apartment blocks or small housing estates much greater and long awaited legal protection when enacted.  I am pleased to note that the legislation will cover not only new developments, but those that have already been completed.As a public representative for Dublin South-East, I am all too familiar with the considerable problems people have experienced with developers who have been reluctant to hand over developments' common areas after their completion.  I regularly receive correspondence from constituents who have experienced difficulties with the property management companies assigned to manage a particular set of apartment blocks.  The most common problem seems to be a lack of transparency as to who is responsible for what and little is seen in return for the money being paid.The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has touched on how current legislation does not meet the needs of people living in these new types of development, which only became popular in the early 1990s.  There has been a significant growth in apartment living in recent years, with areas such as the docklands being developed into prime residential locations.  However, many people were anxious to purchase and did not inspect to any great level of detail the ownership arrangements into which they were entering, namely, their responsibilities and those of the developers, the fees and other rules.  Adjusting to apartment living takes people a while.The first and most welcome aspect of the legislation is that ownership of the common areas will be transferred to the property management company before any apartment is sold.  This will ensure that the practice of developers holding onto a few apartments or units in order to retain control of the management company will be stopped.  It will also ensure that developers cannot return and make changes at will.  In cases where the common areas have not already been transferred to the property management company, the Bill provides that they must be transferred within six months of its enactment.  This is an important provision.Another important feature in the legislation is the new court-based dispute resolution mechanism, which will apply to new and existing multi-unit developments with a strong emphasis on mediation, which is the desired route.  If mediation fails, the court may make an order where it is satisfied that a right has been infringed upon or an obligation has not been discharged.This is critical in ensuring that people have somewhere to turn if a developer or management company is not discharging their duties correctly.  Another new requirement will be a minimum contribution of €200 per unit for a sinking fund to meet any large and non-regular costs.  The sinking fund makes the financial aspects of maintaining an estate smoother and easier.  We are all familiar with stories of half finished hallways, gardens and recreational areas that are not maintained despite people paying in some cases exorbitant maintenance fees.This leads me on to how management fees are arrived at and justified.  Apportionment refers to the method in which the percentage of the overall service charge for the development is attributed to individual owners.  The calculation may be based on a number of factors, for example the size or type of unit, the services availed of or the total number of units in the development.  In the future an owners' management company must establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges and this must be approved by a general meeting of the company's members.The annual charge must be calculated on a transparent basis and be fairly apportioned between apartment owners.  The service charge may not be used to defray expenses on matters which are the responsibility of the developer or builder.  Service charges in respect of any unsold units must be paid by the developer, and will not be fobbed off to those people already The Director of Corporate Enforcement has, in the past, made reference to the growth of management companies being struck off the Companies Register for failure to file annual returns.  The consequences of this for property owners is often more serious than they realise.  For example, it may be difficult to get an insurer to cover the structure of the building, mortgage lenders may invalidate the mortgage on an uninsured property and no one can issue share certificates, so it will be difficult to sell the property, in the event.  Under this new legislation struck off property management may be restored to the Companies Register within a six-year period provided all outstanding annual returns are submitted.  The Department and the Minister have engaged very actively with the public on this piece of legislation, which is most welcome and has been positively received.One aspect of it that has been brought to my attention recently concerns an individual being allocated an apartment from the social housing list, where the landlord is a member of a voluntary housing group, perhaps.  There is a sense among people allocated such social housing apartments that they are not being consulted as regards the management of the particular apartment block, and voluntary housing management should be engaging with social housing tenants within the various apartment blocks.  If this were to be done, it would make a positive difference.  Obviously the service charge is at a reduced rate for people allocated social housing units, but there is still a strong case for their being involved in management decisions that affect the whole apartment block.  Some 20% of the apartments in the Dublin docklands have been let as social housing, and this has been very positive.  However, that in itself brings difficulties because the individuals living in these units believe they are being excluded in a way that affordable or private tenants are not, and this is something the legislation could examine in more detail.During the property boom people were often so anxious to purchase, critical details may have been overlooked in their desire to secure a home.  Eventually, people realised they were liable for unexpected fees and had few or no rights, only after they had made a purchase.  This legislation, when enacted, will ensure that the entire process is clarified and that people will have a much greater say in how their development is run.  That is why I welcome the Bill and look forward to its speedy enactment."	spk_632
Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-06-24	dail	30	Hospital Accommodation	dbsect_23	"I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  It is important to acknowledge the contribution made by Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital to community health facilities in the south east of Dublin, particularly in Dublin 2, where people from the local community were able to visit their relatives who were unwell.  Any family members I have talked to have spoken very highly of the community care at Sir Patrick Dun's.  They use words such as ""caring"", ""pleasant"" and ""helpful"".  At a time when we are all giving out about the health services, it is important to acknowledge that much good work is being carried out.  The staff in Sir Patrick Dun's are of the highest quality.The building is an old one and it was inevitable that at some point it would no longer be feasible to keep people in that setting.  A new structure was built in Vergemount, which is very welcome.  A building has only a certain lifespan, and with people expecting — rightly — higher standards of safety, the old building just did not measure up any more.  Thus, the decision was made to transfer the patients to Vergemount between now and November.My concern is that we must ensure the transfer of patients is done with much consultation with their families, who are anxious about the move.  Their first choice would have been for their relatives to stay in Sir Patrick Dun's; however, they realise it is a better option to move to Vergemount.  It is important that the families are supported during the transfer process.  For example, one 83-year-old lady is visited by her 87-year-old sister every day, but this may not be possible after the transfer.  It makes things much more difficult.  There should be some sort of mechanism under which visits are facilitated and the visiting families are supported.What is the future of Sir Patrick Dun's hospital?  People are concerned about what will happen.  Ideally, it would become a health care facility of some sort, such as a counselling centre.

Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-06-24	dail	30	Hospital Accommodation	dbsect_27	"I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  It is important to acknowledge the contribution made by Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital to community health facilities in the south east of Dublin, particularly in Dublin 2, where people from the local community were able to visit their relatives who were unwell.  Any family members I have talked to have spoken very highly of the community care at Sir Patrick Dun's.  They use words such as ""caring"", ""pleasant"" and ""helpful"".  At a time when we are all giving out about the health services, it is important to acknowledge that much good work is being carried out.  The staff in Sir Patrick Dun's are of the highest quality.The building is an old one and it was inevitable that at some point it would no longer be feasible to keep people in that setting.  A new structure was built in Vergemount, which is very welcome.  A building has only a certain lifespan, and with people expecting — rightly — higher standards of safety, the old building just did not measure up any more.  Thus, the decision was made to transfer the patients to Vergemount between now and November.My concern is that we must ensure the transfer of patients is done with much consultation with their families, who are anxious about the move.  Their first choice would have been for their relatives to stay in Sir Patrick Dun's; however, they realise it is a better option to move to Vergemount.  It is important that the families are supported during the transfer process.  For example, one 83-year-old lady is visited by her 87-year-old sister every day, but this may not be possible after the transfer.  It makes things much more difficult.  There should be some sort of mechanism under which visits are facilitated and the visiting families are supported.What is the future of Sir Patrick Dun's hospital?  People are concerned about what will happen.  Ideally, it would become a health care facility of some sort, such as a counselling centre.  It is a great asset and I would hate to lose it to the private sector.  It is important that it is kept within the health service as a provider of health care in the community.  On a related note, I welcome the commitment of the Minister for Health and Children not to sell St. Luke's Hospital in Rathgar, because that too is a wonderful facility.

Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-06-17	dail	30	Departmental Offices	dbsect_26	In Dublin South East over the past 18 months I have noticed an increasing number of flats being left vacant even though there is a massive demand for social housing.  Social housing lists are under severe strain.  In Dublin 2, Dublin 4, Dublin 6 and Dublin 8 there are more than 240 flats lying idle.  At a conservative estimate, that would accommodate 500 people.  This would cater for a significant number of individuals and families who could live in more suitable accommodation.  At present, there are adults with two or three children living in a one-bedroom flat while they see a vacant two-bedroom flat next door.  It appears that nothing is done with these properties.  The people are obviously frustrated.A person came to me recently and told me he was considering squatting.  I cannot blame people for this.  I would probably do the same if I was in his shoes.  However, that will not solve the Minister's difficulties.  The Minister has done a major job and allocated considerable funding.  Some €7 million has been allocated to retrofitting voids and energy ratings, €2 million has been allocated to compliance with new rental standards and €1.7 million has been allocated for improvement works on flats.  Under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock, which is largely financed from internal resources, is a matter of for each housing authority.  During the boom years, Dublin City Council used to employ contractors to improve the flats and subsequently allocate them.  Now, times are different.  BER statements are taking a considerable length of time and the local authorities are failing to certify flats.  If the prospective tenant is willing to accept a flat in its current condition, it should be allocated on that basis.  This would allow the accommodation and the housing stock to be used up.  The Minister has developed initiatives to ease the pressure on the social housing list.  I am not sure how much support he is getting from the local authorities.  He has drawn up a range of measures to tackle the difficulties and challenges of the social housing lists.It is not acceptable that some 240 flats in a very small area are lying idle and this matter should not be left to the council.  That accommodation should be allocated as a matter of urgency.  The Government should intervene and tell the manager that the job is not being done.  I am not sure where the council spends money or whether it has been allocated enough money.  However, a scheme should be set up so that an emergency fund is provided and Dublin City Council must meet certain targets before money is allocated to the council.	spk_448

Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-06-16	dail	30	Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_34	"I thank Deputy Brady for sharing time.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is a very tough and imaginative Bill and there is nothing wrong with that when one is being fair, and the Minister is fair in every aspect of this.  I welcome it and hope we see more of it over the coming months and years under his stewardship.Fianna Fáil in Government has had the best interests of the most vulnerable at the core of our budgets over many years and despite the recent economic downturn, we have continued to ensure that people most at risk are provided for.  This is borne out by the fact that €500 million more has been spent on welfare this year than in 2009.  The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010, introduced into the house by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív, contains a number of amendments to existing social welfare legislation.  One of the main provisions set out in sections 17 and 18, is the change to unemployment benefit payments if a person refuses to accept a job or training deemed suitable.  That is not unrealistic or unfair.  If somebody is offered a job and is unwilling to interact and be proactive in terms of seeking training and education, why should they not be penalised to a degree?  In some ways I would go further but that may be for another day.  I welcome what the Minister has initiated.This Government is committed to getting as many people back into employment and training as possible.  For example, this year the total number of training and work experience activation places funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation will be approximately 147,000.  A question was asked on whether the places would be there when people were offered suitable training courses, and the answer is clearly ""Yes"".  Some €20 million has also been allocated to a labour market activation fund, which will seek to support innovative proposals over and above mainstream provision for the unemployed and it is expected that it will provide at least 3,500 training places this year alone.In the area of youth unemployment the work placement programme is available which comprises 2,000 places, of which 1,000 are for graduates in addition to community centre and VEC schemes.  This is just a small fraction of the various schemes being driven by Government.  We are providing training and work placement opportunities and where there are appropriate work and training opportunities, people who choose not to participate should be sanctioned.  Most people would agree that one cannot have a system without a sanction mechanism in place.One of the current conditions to obtain jobseekers allowance is that the person must be available for and actively seeking work, and this new provision will ensure that people who are in a position to work or participate in training will be far more incentivised to do so.  Another provision is the change to the one parent family payment.  Now the one parent family payment is payable until the youngest child reaches 18 years of age or 22 years of age if in full-time education where means and other conditions are met.  From April 2011 payments for new customers will only be made until the youngest child in a lone parent family reaches the age of 13.  In comparison to other countries which have similar schemes, the Irish system of support until the child is 22 years of age while in education or 18 years if not in education is extremely generous and well above the norm.  We are making changes but we will still be above the European average and are very competitive in terms of these aspects.There is a special provision for married and cohabiting couples who are recently bereaved and who have children aged 13 years or older.  They will continue to receive the payment for up to two years or until their child is 18 years old to enable them to come to terms with their changed circumstances.  That is a particularly welcome provision because it shows that it is not a one size fits all approach.  Exceptions are made and there is compassion within the system.  There will also be special provisions for families with children for whom domiciliary care allowance is paid.The reason for these changes is that the Government believes the current system encourages long-term welfare dependency and does not encourage movement away from income support.  The changes in this Bill will bring Ireland's support for lone parents more in line with international provisions.  The EU countries that are achieving the best outcomes in terms of tackling child poverty are those that are combining strategies aimed at facilitating access to employment and enabling services such as child care with income support and this is the type of system that the Government wants to move towards.  Whether we have economic difficulties, this is the system towards which we should move.  The Bill also provides for the Minister to appoint persons other than serving staff to be appeals officers.  This will allow for the employment, on a temporary basis, of retired appeals officers as appeals officers to clear the huge backlogs of appeals office, which is another welcome aspect in the Bill.The Opposition attempts to give the impression that it is the guardian of the vulnerable, but as the recent decision by Dublin City Council to abolish the bin waiver scheme proves, this simply is not the case.  This unnecessary and disappointing decision was taken in late 2009, when the majority Fine Gael and Labour Council voted in favour of it, and its full impact is now starting to be felt.  The six Fianna Fáil councillors voted against the budget but were unfortunately outnumbered.  Under the new system, those people who were previously entitled to a waiver do not have to pay a standing charge, but have to pay for their bin lifts.  If people keep up to date with their payments they will receive four free lifts a year.  Individuals who use the bag system and were receiving free bag tags will now get 36 tags a year and will have to pay for any tags over that amount.  This move, which was passed by the majority Labour vote on Dublin City Council, has unfortunately exposed the old and the vulnerable to more expense, and could have been avoided if the Labour Party and Fine Gael had worked to re-organise rather than abolish the scheme and the waste management section in Dublin City Council.The Government is committed to protecting the most vulnerable in society.  The provisions in this Bill, as well as continuing this protection, will encourage people who are in a position to do so to enter training, education and work and move away from State reliance.  It is important to put it into context, in terms of the increases in pensions and welfare payments over the years.  In the past decade, pension rates and unemployment benefits have increased by 130% and child benefit increased by more than 330%.  During the same period, the cost of living increased by 40%.  This is a tough, fair and imaginative Bill and I welcome it."	spk_632
Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-06-03	dail	30	Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010: Second Stage	dbsect_20	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  If Deputy Crawford has inherited his mother's genes — she lived to 98 — then he has a long career in politics ahead of him.The Bill provides for amendments to various Acts, namely, the Health Acts of 1947 and 1953, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  As Deputy Crawford indicated, however, the main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the dissolution of the board of St. Luke's Hospital, the transfer of the employees at the hospital to other facilities and the transfer of its assets and liabilities to the HSE.St. Luke's Hospital is located in Rathgar in my constituency of Dublin South-East.  For over 50 years it has provided state-of-the-art care for cancer patients from all over Ireland.  I do not believe I have ever heard anyone cast aspersions on or express concerns about the care provided at St. Luke's.  The fondness former patients have for the hospital and the high esteem in which they hold it is evidence of the high standards which obtain there.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff who, over many years, have provided an invaluable service to the people of Dublin and elsewhere.In 1981, the Friends of St. Luke's Hospital was established to fund-raise and enhance the care and services available at the hospital.  To date, over €26 million has been raised by people who have in some way been touched by what happens at the hospital.  There is not a family in Ireland which has not in some way been affected by the curse of cancer.  The raising of €26 million is an incredible achievement and those responsible should be commended for it.  The Friends of St. Luke's Hospital has done a huge amount of positive work.St. Luke's Hospital is currently the largest provider of radiation, oncology and radiotherapy services in Ireland.  It has 179 beds and almost 500 staff.  As already stated, the Bill provides for the dissolution of the board of St. Luke's Hospital and the transfer of its assets and liabilities to the HSE.  The decision to proceed in this way was taken on foot of recommendations for the establishment of an integrated national oncology and wider cancer treatment service which were presented to the Department.  The former director of the national cancer control programme, NCCP, Professor Tom Keane advised and strongly recommended that this should happen.I am of the view that this is the best route to take in the context of cancer treatment.  In view of the nature of cancer, establishing centres of excellence is the way to go.  People will state that what is being done is not sufficient.  A journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step.  I am of the view that this is an important step on the journey towards ensuring that there will be a top-class cancer service in this country.The multidisciplinary approach to cancer treatment that is currently being pursued is central to the Government's strategy for the creation of a world-class cancer treatment service and is in line with best international practice.  The board of St. Luke's Hospital is fully committed to supporting the Government's decision because it recognises that the approach being taken will ensure the optimal outcome for patients and will in time lead to better survival rates for those who contract cancer.Two new radiotherapy centres will open at St. James's and Beaumont hospitals at the end of 2010 under phase 1 of the national plan for radiation oncology.  As Deputy Crawford stated, it is important that we ensure that when the services at St. Luke's Hospital are being wound down, alternative services that will match the standards set at the latter in the past will be available.  The radiotherapy centre at St. Luke's will combine with these new centres to form the St. Luke's radiation oncology network.  All staff will be employees of the HSE.  Staff and resources may be shared across the network and there will be a single team of physicists, engineers and other support staff for the three centres at St. Luke's, St. James's and Beaumont.Some staff and resources from St. Luke's will be transferred to other sites in the network in the second half of this year.  The Department of Health and Children is working closely with the board of management of St. Luke's and the NCCP to ensure that the ethos of St. Luke's will be retained in the new structure.  One of the major assets of St. Luke's is the ethos to which I refer.  Others include the services provided, the compassion of staff and the magnificent and tranquil setting in which the hospital is located.  Radiotherapy services will continue to be delivered at St. Luke's until at least 2014, when additional capacity is scheduled to come on stream under phase 2 of the national plan for radiation oncology.  We must ensure that we obtain a commitment that following the completion of this integration, the Department of Health and Children will see to it that the future of St. Luke's will be aptly planned for.As already stated, St. Luke's provides a calm and tranquil setting in which people can undergo serious health treatment and recuperate.  The value of this cannot be overstated for those who are undergoing difficult treatment and living through an extremely stressful period.  There is a special quality about St. Luke's and I urge the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that the site will be retained in order that the type of care to which I refer can continue to be provided there for those who require it.As I have stated on many occasions and as the Minister will be aware, there is a chronic shortage of step-down facilities in the constituency of Dublin South-East.  St. Luke's is unique in the context of the provision of respite and palliative care and the site on which it is located should be earmarked for the provision of continuing care in the area.  A number of services are currently being provided in the area, including the out-of-hours GP service, which has been extremely effective.  We must develop it and ensure that we take advantage of the fact that we possess a prime location on the southside of Dublin.Last year, the Minister opened new step-down facilities at the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook and at Brú Chaoimhín in Cork Street.  These developments are welcome but they constitute only a small piece of the jigsaw.  We must ensure that more beds to cater for people who are coming out of hospital are brought on stream.Deputies who live in Dublin will be aware that families in the city are often expected to send their elderly relatives to homes in counties Wicklow, Kildare or Meath.  This is a major inconvenience for families, particularly those with young children, who are obliged to travel long distances to visit such relatives.  People feel extremely guilty if they do not visit their elderly relatives and the need to travel long distances places a major strain on extended families.There is a significant burden of travel, for example, for an inner-city family whose elderly relative is being cared for somewhere in Kildare or Wicklow.  That is difficult financially and emotionally and it takes a lot out of families.It is vital that we take the opportunity to ensure St. Luke's Hospital is developed in a way that is supportive of the need for community services by providing step-down facilities and long-term beds.  The hospital is an ideal site for the provision of such services and it should be preserved, even ring-fenced, to ensure people in the area have access to step-down facilities such as those available at the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook and the Brú Chaoimhín in Cork Street.  That will ensure families have shorter distances to travel to see their parents and grandparents and will be able to give them the care and attention they need and deserve.  No family should have to make long traumatic journeys on various modes of public transport or be stuck in traffic for hours in order to visit a loved one.  I am disappointed no decision has yet been made regarding the future of the St. Luke's site.  It is a magnificent facility on the south side of Dublin which offers an opportunity to cater for the older people in our community who, at a difficult period in their lives, require care.  Their plight should not be added to by having to be parted from their families due to weaknesses or gaps within the service.Will the Minister of State give an assurance that this site, with its long tradition of providing health care, will remain in the hands of the Health Service Executive and will become a step-down facility that will continue to serve the community of Dublin South-East in the manner it has done for many years?  I have visited many patients there and there is a tranquillity and serenity about the place that can only aid patients' recovery.  The Friends of St. Luke's Hospital have done great work in the past in raising large amounts of money for the hospital.  A decision to sell off the land for some type of development would be the worst of all options.  Given the time and money invested in the site by the board, patients and relatives of patients, it would be a shame to let the opportunity slip past us to secure the future of this magnificent facility.Almost every family has been touched by the traumatic experience of cancer.  Concerns have been expressed in some quarters about the transferral of services to St. James's Hospital, but St. Luke's Hospital is not too far from St. James's.  The latter will not have the same appeal or offer the same tranquillity, but it will offer the services that are needed as it develops into a centre of excellence that will improve recovery rates for cancer sufferers.  It is imperative that we ensure we have the best facilities available to those with cancer.Deputy Crawford said earlier that St. Luke's Hospital is to be closed; I do not see it as closure but as the transferral of services.  We have an opportunity to develop community services and to ensure older people can be cared for in their communities.  Any report that is available will show there is a shortage of step-down facilities for families in the south Dublin area.  I spoke to a woman today whose mother is in a facility beyond Bray and who is finding the travel particularly difficult.  She hopes to find somewhere closer to home for her mother where her mother's husband will also be able to visit.  That is another problem that often arises, where one older person may be unfit to remain at home but his or her partner can do so.  That puts a huge strain on the person who is at home and may have to rely on extended family to visit his or her spouse.  As I said, we should grasp the opportunity that is before us.  I urge the Minister of State to give a commitment to maintaining St. Luke's Hospital in Rathgar as a facility providing essential community services.	spk_601

I express my condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives.  I welcome the positive stance the Minister, Deputy Martin, has taken, which is helpful and is recognised across the world.  Deputy Timmins made a very helpful and positive contribution, which is welcomed.Where does one start when it comes to Israel?  One could look a long time back, but I would like to start with three or four years ago when Israel imposed the blockade on Gaza.  As previous speakers have said it is a humanitarian disaster.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, and Mary Robinson have been there.  John Ging is there on a daily basis and he has testified that it is a humanitarian disaster.  It is clear that is illegal and immoral, and must end.  As Deputy Breen said, it is, in effect, an open prison.  In November 2008, six weeks before operation Cast Lead, Deputy Ó Snodaigh and I took the same route this flotilla took and we could see for ourselves that it was an outrageous way to force anybody live.  On top of that, Israel then bombed the Gaza Strip and killed more than 1,400 people, including hundreds of children.  It made already horrific conditions even more horrific.  We then had members of Israel's Mossad organisation using stolen international passports going around and killing people illegally.  We have had an immoral blockade, the bombing of the Gaza Strip and the illegal use of stolen passports.  Now we have witnessed the attack of a peaceful flotilla bringing humanitarian aid.  Such disproportionate actions in effect force people into the arms of extremism.It is vital for the Irish State to now defend the 	spk_296

Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-05-19	dail	30	Euro Area Loan Facility Bill 2010: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_24	I am delighted to get a brief opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill, which is part of a process of solidarity.  We are part of the European Union and have agreed to help Greece, which is what being in the European Union is about.  We have been helped in the past by other countries, with the Germans in particular ongoing supporters and contributors to the Irish economy.  When the shoe is on the other foot, we should not be found wanting.  It is our time to support another small country and in many ways, Greece is similar to Ireland.  We have found significant benefit in the eurozone but we must ensure stability.As Deputy Byrne mentioned, the money will be returned.  More important than the €1.3 billion over three years is the stability returned to the eurozone.  That stability is not just notional and it will allow small and medium-sized enterprises to start functioning again.  They will get back their confidence and banks will ensure the flow of money is available to such enterprises.  The notion of stability is not theoretical but will have a significant impact on the ordinary person going to a bank for a loan, such as a businessperson employing five or six people.  Small and medium-sized enterprises employ over 700,000 people in this country and are the backbone of the economy.  They need this stability.By joining other countries in supporting Greece we are getting much back.  The stability will return confidence to the Irish consumer, who is still very nervous.  Savings deposits are large and we must coax people to spend money again to get it running through the economy and the retail sector in particular.  There are signs of improvement and a range of indicators show such improvements.  The retail sector is tentatively improving and a current Minister of State, Deputy Seán Connick, advocated the introduction of a scrappage scheme in the motor sector which has made a difference.  That industry has stabilised and is on the up.  We are moving in the right direction slowly and steadily.The money from the State will be pooled with other loans from euro area member states and it will be allocated by the European Commission and the ECB.  It must be stated that Greece is not just getting a free meal ticket.  It must introduce radical reforms which I imagine will be traumatic.  It must significantly reduce public expenditure and there will be ongoing appraisal and assessments by the European Commission, which must ensure that Greece meets the criteria set down.  Although we are giving much, we are getting much in return, including a stability that is important for the Irish economy.	spk_501
Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-04-22	dail	30	Central Bank Reform Bill 2010: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_9	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this matter because regardless of which side of the House one is on, we all agree the revelations in regard to our banking system and the lack supposed regulation, which was designed to protect customers and society, are truly shocking.In common with many other countries, including the UK and the US, the Irish regulatory system failed abysmally to carry out its role which was to ensure the financial institutions behaved in a responsible manner.  The true scale of the appalling state of our country's banks, as the Minister for Finance indicated, was beyond anyone's notion of the worst case scenario.This week, we heard Irish Nationwide Building Society incurred losses of more than €2 billion.  That is more than it ever made in profits, which is outrageous.  I sometimes think the public believes Members of the House are somehow supportive of the banks.  We are as outraged, angry and upset by the actions of the people in charge of the banks at that time.  Likewise, the revelations in regard to Anglo Irish Bank and other financial institutions have shaken the public's faith in those at the top of the financial sector.There are many different views about NAMA.  My view is that it is the right course of action.  It is bringing stability to the financial system.  The Minister for Finance and the Department officials deserve great credit for the way they examined in detail every possible option available to them.  NAMA has received the support of the IMF and the ECB which stated that measures in the legislation should restore confidence in the banking system, which is the case.  The Minister highlighted the favourable reaction of the financial markets to the steps the Government is taking to address our economic difficulty, although I do not believe people in Ireland are as easily convinced.  Greece has been forced to borrowed at 8% which shows the steps Ireland is taking are well regarded internationally.The Financial Regulator failed to carry out his primary function.  He did not regulate the banks which abused the trust shown in them.  To say their behaviour was reckless is an understatement.  The behaviour of some of those bankers was nothing short of criminal and the public is rightly outraged and shocked, as are Members of the House, as to how this was allowed to happen.Internationally, there was a view that over-regulation and interference was, in many ways, anti-business or anti-growth but with hindsight, trusting the banks to behave in a responsible manner was the equivalent of allowing the lunatics to run the asylum.Last week, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown admitted he was not tough enough in regulating the banks.  He agreed that an era of light touch regulation had grown in the UK.  Likewise, we were not tough enough in regulating our banks.  There is no question about this.  However, I am optimistic that the new measures the Minister for Finance set out in the Bill will ensure that taxpayers will never again be held to ransom by the banks and that they will overhaul regulation in this country.Mr. Elderfield, Mr. McDonagh and Professor Honohan appeared before committees recently.  They gave everybody a shot of confidence.  They have all performed exceptionally well.  They are seen as independent and as being on top of their briefs.  As I said, they have given confidence politically, economically and financially.This Bill is the first of a three stage legislative programme — to create a new fully integrated structure for financial regulation, to enhance the powers and functions of the Central Bank and to consolidate existing legislation.  This is a detailed Bill with many different parts but the main component of the Central Bank Reform Bill is the merging of the functions of the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator.  This merger will create a single regulatory body.  A Central Bank commission will be created and will be responsible for proper regulation and supervision of the financial services market, including regulation of the service providers.I welcome the fact an Oireachtas committee will receive an annual regulatory performance statement.  This is a sensible move and will ensure greater Oireachtas oversight and accountability.  As the Minister highlighted, this step is consistent with the recent recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General in a special report on the Financial Regulator.  Likewise, the Bill requires the bank to arrange regulator peer reviews of its regulatory performance at least every four years and to report on such reviews.  The bank will also be required to prepare a strategy statement every three years in addition to its annual reports and accounts.  There are many components to this Bill that will radically reform financial regulation, which is badly needed.  It will slowly restore confidence in the banking system.However, I do not believe that even now the bankers who caused the crisis fully appreciate the implications of what they have done.  Last night, Richie Boucher bowed to political pressure to forgo his pension top-up.  However, I find it unbelievable that Bank of Ireland, given its current financial situation, would have agreed to go ahead with this payment.  People talk about contracts and rules and about how nothing can be done if these payments have been agreed in advance.  However, how is it that private companies can change terms, reduce salaries and alter pension contributions in order to achieve savings?  Our banks and those in positions of power need to understand that it is only because of the Irish taxpayer that they are still in existence and attempts to make pension payments and bonuses agreed in a radically different economic environment are simply delusional.  The trust of the public is eroded each time a story such as the Richie Boucher one appears.	spk_328

The Miami Five were five Cubans who were sent to try to infiltrate Miami-based terrorist groups to prevent them from carrying out terrorist actions against the people of Cuba.  The information they collected built up into a substantial intelligence dossier on the workings of the terrorist groups.  The Cuban Government invited the FBI to Havana and presented it with 4,000 pages of documentary evidence on the activities of the groups concerned.  While the Cubans felt confident this information would lead to arrests and prosecutions, instead of so doing the FBI arrested the five Cubans.  The charges brought against them included travelling on false passports, failing to register as foreign agents, conspiracy to commit espionage and conspiracy to commit crimes against the United States of America.The trial was deeply flawed and failed to prove these men were guilty of the charges brought against them.  The original trial was one of the longest ever held in the United States and the judge acknowledged that members of the jury had been intimidated.  Moreover, before the trial, the men were held for 33 months without bail, during 17 of which they were held in solitary confinement.  This punishment typically only is used to punish prisoners who are guilty of violent crimes after conviction and prison regulations in the United States generally permit a maximum of 60 days in solitary confinement.Hundreds of NGOs from all around the world, including international human rights organisations, lawyers' groups, parliamentarians, trade unions and academics have called for an appeal of this case.  However, the United States Supreme Court has declined such calls and has refused to provide a reason for its decision.  Deputy Finian McGrath will agree with my call on the Government to address this miscarriage of justice at the highest diplomatic level and for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise the matter at European Council level.	spk_471

Last Tuesday I met with members of the Irish Thalidomide Association who were in Leinster House to brief the Joint Committee on Health and Children on their situation.  Their story is one of the most difficult and tragic I have come across, and is all the more upsetting because it could have been prevented.  We can get bogged down in this House with legalities, politics, reports and so on and tend to forget about the individual stories.  At the meeting Ms Maggie Woods gave a harrowing account of her life story which was upsetting to hear.  It put the issue in context.There are 32 acknowledged thalidomide survivors in the State, the children of women who unwittingly took the prescribed morning sickness medication with no realisation of the hugely damaging effect it would have on their unborn children.  This drug was marketed between 1958 and 1961 and was withdrawn from use after it was linked to birth deformities.  Thalidomide causes severe foetal damage by preventing the growth of new blood vessels at critical periods in the baby's development.  The most obvious effects are absent or foreshortened limbs but children's vision and hearing were also affected while others sustained damage to internal organs.  Many babies did not survive the pregnancy and many more died in infancy.The 32 survivors are brave people who have managed to live extraordinary lives.  They are remarkably well adjusted despite the difficulties they have encountered in their lives.  They have managed to overcome those difficulties without any of the sense of bitterness and anger one might expect.  They are well adjusted and surprisingly so given their experiences.A lump sum was paid decades ago to the parents of survivors.  However, the amount was small and it was not believed thalidomide victims would live long.  Special assistance may be required to allow these survivors to continue to live as independently as possible.  There is an onus on the State to provide monetary compensation to ensure the needs of these people are met.Earlier last month the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Mr. McGimpsey, announced a £1.1 million compensation package for survivors in Northern Ireland of thalidomide, of which there are 18.  This followed on from the Britain's announcement of a compensation fund of £20 million for its 466 thalidomide survivors.  I believe the Government has a responsibility to provide for our survivors.Following two years of campaigning and almost 50 years of distress there has been no progress in regard to the review of the 1975 thalidomide agreement called for by the ITA.  On Tuesday, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children resolved to contact the Minister to request that they be included in the State Claims Agency report.  The ITA is requesting an acknowledgment of the wrong done — it was wrong for this drug to be licensed by the State — an apology for survivors and the families of those who did not survive, and disclosure of documents.  The Department of Health and Children has refused to grant voluntary disclosure of documents in all Departments pertaining to this tragedy, despite the passing of 50 years.  The ITA is also requesting a fair and equitable compensation package, including a health care package that properly addresses the unique needs of this group to ensure they can maintain the level of deteriorating health they continue to experience and where possible to lead independent lives.I ask that fairness and justice be applied to this particular group and that this matter be given full attention.	spk_607

Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-02-11	dail	30	Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_5	"I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to speak on this measure.The purpose of the Industrial Relations Bill, which was published last summer, is to strengthen the existing system for making employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements, as well as providing for their continued effective operation.Some of the main amendments in the Bill include the introduction of a set of principles and policies to which regard should be had in making proposals for an employment regulation order or ERO; the introduction of a set of procedures to be followed when formulating proposals for an ERO; ensuring Oireachtas scrutiny of EROs and Registered Employment Agreements or REAs; and setting a fixed term of office for the chairman of a JLC.The Bill also includes provision for an amendment to section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to allow officers of VECs, other than teachers, to have access to dispute-settling agencies.Last week, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, a worrying picture was painted by the Restaurants Association of Ireland of that industry's future.  The association's representatives made a stark presentation which was heavily critical of the JLC structure.  Those engaged in the catering industry are invariably small operations, yet collectively they employ a large number of people.  They can be compact operations which generally have good relations with their staff, with whom they interact closely.If there are too many restaurants in the sector it can, by its nature, pose difficulties.  Nonetheless, many restaurateurs have tried to franchise their businesses, although it is a personalised operation.  Their dealings with staff and customers are very personalised.  Owners invest much time and money in establishing restaurants and it is natural for them to have a vision and aspiration as to how they will develop.  They want to make a difference in terms of employment and all the benefits that bestows on society.  However, in some cases the staff in restaurants are earning more money than the people who invested the money and time and who, when the business is quiet, cannot relax because they are worrying about whether they have done something wrong or upset a group of customers and, when it is busy, just do not have time to do all the work that is required.  They take all those worries home with them.  In most instances not many of the staff do that, and when it gets to the stage where the staff are taking home more money than the business owners, we have a problem.  Last week, the Restaurant Association of Ireland painted a very bleak picture of the future unless we make changes.  This Bill, with the introduction of an inability to pay provision, should go some way towards alleviating the pressures that employers in this and other sectors currently experience under both systems, as a consequence of the absence of a mechanism for processing claims for inability to pay.  I welcome that measure.Clearly businesses are under severe pressure from every quarter.  Rates, rents and staff costs all contribute to putting businesses out of business.  The consequences are not just limited to the business and its employees, but also affect their spouses and children.  We should not just dismiss it as an attack on the workers.  Restaurateurs have no interest in attacking workers.  They want to make a living and get a few bob out of the business.  They enjoy the cut and thrust of business.  They also want to ensure that their staff are treated well.  They work with and know their staff.  It is certainly not ""them versus us"" in the restaurant business.  I have worked in the catering industry for many years and I know there is not great glory involved — except perhaps for one of these new celebrity chefs.  For the vast majority of people working in the restaurant business, while it is very rewarding, it is also very difficult work.  The Bill goes some way towards addressing that matter.While on the subject of labour affairs, there is an issue in my constituency outside the restaurant business which, while not affected by any of the measures to be introduced in this Bill, requires urgent attention from the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs.  Last summer, the official industrial dispute at Marine Terminals Limited in Dublin Port received much media attention and there were some protest marches.  The dispute started on 3 July 2009 and was suspended by the striking workers more than three months ago.  One would have expected some resolution could have been found during that period.  The company accepted a Labour Court recommendation on 20 October 2009.  The outstanding issues were referred to a Labour Court appointed arbitrator who issued a final decision on Wednesday, 6 January.People may not realise that the company is question, Marine Terminals Limited, whose parent company is the Peel Ports Group, has now stated that it is not bound by the arbitrator's decision and will not comply with this decision.  This action displays an appalling disregard for the State's labour dispute mechanisms and means that the staff affected by this dispute have been left in limbo, with apparently no other options available to them.  Furthermore, it would appear that there are no repercussions for this company which is behaving so disgracefully.  The people who criticise unions and are ideologically opposed to them do not seem to realise that the unions only exist because of the actions of such companies which have an absolute disregard for employees.  Such cases have an impact on staff relations in small and medium-sized enterprises with a knock-on effect in the restaurant business.  Every business is perceived in terms of them and us, which is not always the case.  In this case, Marine Terminals Limited's blatant disregard for the industrial relations process in many ways hardens people's views.  It certainly hardens the views of those working there and their families.The Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process.  It is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the court's recommendations.  In an ideal world, companies entering these negotiations would behave in an honourable manner and concede to the courts and arbitrators recommendations.  However, we all know that in the real world, money is what drives commercial companies rather than doing the honourable and decent thing.  That certainly appears to be the attitude of some very large international companies.  The Government must place some form of sanction on companies who choose to abdicate their responsibilities.  Why do we have all of these systems in place if there is nothing to ensure that they will be abided by?It makes me angry when I reflect on this particular case.  At this stage, the Government must take some action to ensure that companies, which accept Labour Court recommendations and then renege on them, must face some consequence; otherwise, it undermines the entire industrial relations system.  The employees of Marine Terminals Limited are decent and honourable people in my constituency who placed their faith in the Labour Court system.  At this stage they appear to have been failed by the system.While I have drifted somewhat off the point, it is a serious matter that needs consideration.  The Bill is a step in the right direction and addresses some of the issues and concerns of businesses.  Ultimately, we must support businesses which represent the lifeblood of society.  People talk about the differences between society and the economy.  The economy supports society.  It ensures that we have and can pay for a good healthy society.  The Bill is good and I commend it the House."	spk_274
Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-02-10	dail	30	Finance Bill 2010: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_23	The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, last week published the Finance Bill 2010 which gives effect to the measures announced by him in his Budget Statement on 9 December last.  The Bill contains measures that, though clearly difficult, are necessary to stabilise the economy.  It is important to highlight that this Bill also contains many pro-enterprise measures, which have been welcomed both at home and internationally.  As Deputy O'Connor noted, listening to the difficulties being experienced by the Greek economy in particular, and the reluctance of the Greek Government to face up to those difficulties, its position is in sharp contrast to the Irish experience, which has shown we are capable of making and willing to make very difficult decisions.  The Irish Government is being held up in many circles as an example of best practice in tackling the economic difficulties.All parties accepted that savings of €4 billion had to be found in this budget.  Obviously, people will have very different opinions about how this was to be done.  The Government was as fair as it could be and has tried to ensure to the best of its ability that the most vulnerable are protected.The domicile levy of €200,000 was a correct measure, which will see the wealthiest of our society contributing more to help the economy through this difficult period.  Some measures have undoubtedly been difficult for many people, including an unfortunate but necessary reduction in public sector pay.  Overall, while those measures were and are difficult for the people experiencing them, we in this House included, I welcome the decisive action taken by the Cabinet and the Minister for Finance in dealing with the current economic crisis.I am also pleased to point out some very positive initiatives contained in the Bill.  As I said, there are many sensible pro-enterprise measures that will make Ireland a more attractive place to do business.  One of those measures amends the remittance basis of taxation so it will be easier to attract highly qualified managerial or technical people to Ireland to ensure Irish industry operates to world class standards.  Furthermore, the simplifying of the processes to pay dividends and royalties and expanding the tax regime to facilitate international companies locating their headquarters here should increase Ireland's attractiveness to large corporate companies.For small and medium-sized enterprises in operation here in Ireland, a credit system review scheme is to be established which will give SMEs, farm enterprises and sole traders the right to appeal, where an application for credit is refused by a financial institution participating in NAMA, after the bank's own internal process has been finalised.  Under this new scheme, if it is recommended that credit should be granted, the participating institution that refused credit must comply or provide a written explanation for its refusal.  In recent months, I have been contacted by countless SMEs which have informed me of the difficulties they are experiencing in accessing credit.  However, banks have been telling a different story in claiming that they are open for business.  While this new credit system should prevent the banks from fudging the facts, more needs to be done to free up credit to the SME sector.The Tánaiste recently indicated that she might put in place a bank guarantee scheme.  I have previously called for this measure to be implemented and I again put on record my support for the scheme.The Minister for Finance, though having had to find savings, has attempted to do so in the fairest way possible and has also implemented many smart and welcome measures which will benefit Ireland in the long term.  I again commend the Minister for Finance on his hard work and dedication to rectifying Ireland's economy.  I commend the Bill to the House.	spk_622
Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-02-04	dail	30	Flood Relief.	dbsect_25	"I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this matter.The right to feel safe in one's own home is a basic entitlement.  Article 40.5 of the Constitution states specifically: ""The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.""  In recent years, a number of high-profile incidents have increased the focus on this subject, most recently the tragic death in Waterford of Mr. Paddy Barry, who died after an aggravated attack by a burglar in his home in Waterford.  There has been a perception, somewhat unfairly, that the law in this area comes down more on the side of the people who perpetrate these crimes rather than those on whom the crime is committed.  The Government is currently preparing legislation which will clarify this matter and ensure that homeowners are more confident in their right to defend their dwellings.I welcome this move and the stance the Minister has taken on the matter.  However, there should be greater deterrents for the people who commit these crimes, particularly against the elderly and vulnerable.  One such deterrent would be the introduction of mandatory sentences for burglary and aggravated burglary.  l am aware that there are two opposing views in this regard.  There are those who would say that mandatory sentencing will not solve the underlying problems that cause people to commit these crimes; however, it is my belief that the thought of going to prison for a set number of years will make many burglars think twice before they enter a property.According to recent CSO statistics, there were 26,783 burglaries and related offences last year — an increase of 8.5% — while the annual increase in aggravated burglary offences, compared with 2008, was 11.7%.  Statistics show that Dublin is the worst affected area, with 32.7% of all burglaries.  In my own constituency of Dublin South-East there has been a spate of burglaries recently in which elderly people are targeted in their homes.  The criminals prey on the trusting nature of these homeowners by posing as council officials or people on official business such as television licence inspectors.  While the Garda has been excellent in combating such crimes, providing people with checklists for home security and warning them not to trust anyone they do not know, it is an uphill battle due to the fact that many of the perpetrators serve only a few months in prison before being let out on the streets again.The Attorney General has asked the Law Reform Commission to consider the issue of mandatory sentencing, particularly for those who attack the vulnerable in our society.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said he is open-minded on the subject of mandatory sentences and has not ruled them out, but he queried the need for them in view of the fact that a maximum sentence could apply.  I had hoped to have the statistics of how many maximum sentences have been handed out; unfortunately, I am still awaiting that figure.  Although I could stand corrected, the handing out of maximum sentences is not the norm for burglaries.Finally, Age Action has pointed out that while older persons are less likely to be victims of crime compared to other age groups, they are three times more likely to fear for their well-being in their own area than younger people.  It is simply not good enough to have our elderly people living in fear and I would strongly support the implementation of mandatory sentencing for those who perpetrate these crimes on the vulnerable in society."	spk_589

Article 40.5 of the Constitution states specifically: ""The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.""  In recent years, a number of high-profile incidents have increased the focus on this subject, most recently the tragic death in Waterford of Mr. Paddy Barry, who died after an aggravated attack by a burglar in his home in Waterford.  There has been a perception, somewhat unfairly, that the law in this area comes down more on the side of the people who perpetrate these crimes rather than those on whom the crime is committed.  The Government is currently preparing legislation which will clarify this matter and ensure that homeowners are more confident in their right to defend their dwellings.I welcome this move and the stance the Minister has taken on the matter.  However, there should be greater deterrents for the people who commit these crimes, particularly against the elderly and vulnerable.  One such deterrent would be the introduction of mandatory sentences for burglary and aggravated burglary.  l am aware that there are two opposing views in this regard.  There are those who would say that mandatory sentencing will not solve the underlying problems that cause people to commit these crimes; however, it is my belief that the thought of going to prison for a set number of years will make many burglars think twice before they enter a property.According to recent CSO statistics, there were 26,783 burglaries and related offences last year — an increase of 8.5% — while the annual increase in aggravated burglary offences, compared with 2008, was 11.7%.  Statistics show that Dublin is the worst affected area, with 32.7% of all burglaries.

In 2003, Ireland came close to introducing a chewing gum levy.  However, ultimately this move did not go ahead and I believe now is an opportune time for the issue to be revisited.Chewing gum residue is unsightly and very difficult and costly to remove.  In an ideal world, people who chew gum would dispose of it properly in litter bins but unfortunately, this does not happen, and like cigarettes, the residue ends up on the streets.

I believe that while the gum litter taskforce has done great work in raising awareness of this problem and educating people about disposing of their litter, a levy is the only way forward and I would ask that the Minister to strongly consider this.While I welcome the raising of on-the-spot fines for littering from €25 to €150, it is critical that these are processed in order to be effective in deterring people from littering.

Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2010-01-21	dail	30	Civil Partnership Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_7	I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am proud to be a member of a party which has advocated legal reform in this area.  Credit is due to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  The Bill will have no negative impact because it builds on previous equality legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil.  It deals with the issue of freedom of conscience and our legislation is sufficiently robust to address any issues that arise.I have met the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network to discuss the Bill.  It is clear that both organisations recognise it as progressive legislation.  The Government's efforts to bring the Bill before the House demonstrate that we remain active on social issues even while we continue to focus on our economic and financial problems.  The media think that everything starts and ends with finance but a significant body of legislation on other matters is being progressed.Irish society and the traditional family unit have changed dramatically over the past 20 years.  A one size fits all approach can no longer be taken because provision must be made to protect people in loving same sex relationships and couples who choose to cohabit rather than marry.According to the excellent brief prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, cohabiting couples are the fastest growing form of family unit.  The 2006 census revealed that cohabiting couples account for 12% of all family units, compared to 8% in 2002.  The number of cohabiting same sex couples is also on the rise, having grown from 1,300 couples in 2002 to more than 2,000 in 2006.  The law as it stands does not give any legal protection to cohabiting couples, even where they have lived together for many years.  Many couples may not realise their vulnerability until they experience break up or the death of a partner.  This Bill seeks to address these concerns.  Given past difficulties in Irish society, it is difficult to understand why anybody could object to this positive proposal, the overarching objective of which is to encourage and support loving relationships.  It is irrelevant whether those relationships are same sex or otherwise.The Bill will rectify the unacceptable situation where a broad section of society was thus far unprotected legally.  For same sex couples it establishes a new status of relationship which is legally recognised by the State.  It provides for a scheme of registration of civil partnerships for same sex couples, together with a range of rights and duties following registration to include shared home protection and succession and pension rights.  It will also allow cohabitees, whether opposite or same sex, to regulate their own financial matters and will provide for a limited redress scheme where a cohabitee is left economically dependent.  Under the Bill, legislation relating to mental health, immigration and domestic violence, for example, will be amended to ensure the same provision for same sex partners as for spouses in opposite sex marriages.Although the Bill is extremely progressive, I acknowledge that it does not offer an equivalent to marriage for same sex couples and, for this reason, it will not satisfy everybody.  However, it would be churlish not to acknowledge that it is a major step forward which, for the first time, offers recognition and protection to those in same sex relationships.  That said, the legislation should include greater reference to children of civil partners.  I accept that there are constitutional barriers, as referred to by other speakers, which must be addressed.  I am certain, as sure as night follows day, that legislation will be introduced in due course which offers children of same sex couples the same status and protection as those of opposite sex relationships.  In the meantime I am concerned that children of same sex couples are left somewhat isolated and vulnerable as a consequence of this omission in this legislation.  However, it is not appropriate to deal with these issues in this Bill.  These concerns will inevitably be addressed in future legislation.Since the Bill was flagged some time ago, I have met several couples in loving same sex relationships and found that they were, broadly speaking, pleased with the proposals.  Many gay people had been of the view that this type of legislation would never be introduced.  I spoke recently to a friend raising a child with her same sex partner and she was extremely sceptical that these measures would become law.  I will be pleased to send her the transcript of today's debate.  Many gay and lesbian people were not confident this day would ever come.  In this context it is important to acknowledge the commitment of the Government not only to economic issues but to social policies.  I warmly welcome the Bill, which represents an enormous step forward for our society.	spk_266

It was issued to allow British retailers and consumers to distinguish between products from Palestinian producers and those from Israeli settlements in the region.  That act would give the consumer the ability to choose the produce he or she buys.  I urge the Government to follow the British Government on this matter.  Currently under European law, foods from outside the EU must be labelled with their country of origin.  Products from the West Bank are not differentiated between settlement and Palestinian.  However, under new, progressive UK guidelines, the British Government recommends indicating whether Palestinians or settlers made the product on the labels of West Bank produce.Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are unlawful under international law.  They contravene Article 49.6 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 1949, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its own civilian population into occupied territory.  The move by the British Government peacefully and constructively sends a message to Israel that Britain recognises that this is illegal behaviour and will provide its citizens with appropriate information to allow them make an informed decision now on whether they wish to purchase foods produced in illegal settlements.Israel has shown flagrant disregard for both international law and the human rights of the Palestinians.  According to Mr. John Ging, in 2009, the number of Gazans living in abject poverty trebled to 300,000, which equates to one in five residents of Gaza.  Gaza is one of the poorest and most densely populated places on earth and, for the past three years, the Israelis have maintained a blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has slowly and systematically brought the residents and infrastructure of the area to their knees.  The Government and the international community are failing in their moral obligation to prevent human rights abuses in this matter.  Israel is breaking the law without any repercussions, but it is important to acknowledge that Ireland and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in particular, has been a positive influence and been supportive of the peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  I ask that the Government implements this labelling process without delay as a gesture to the Palestinian people that they are recognised by the Irish people.	spk_425

I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is intended to update the provisions of earlier Planning Acts.  It will support economic renewal and promote sustainable development by ensuring that the planning system complements and supports infrastructural development around the country.I agree with Deputy Mitchell's contention that trees cause significant problems throughout the city.  Dublin City Council had to dig up a number of cherry trees because of the damage they caused to footpaths along the quays.  Given the height of some of these trees, they would be refused planning permission if they were buildings.  In urban settings, it is important that the size of trees is appropriate to the areas in which they grow.  Some people think they are living in Glenveagh National Park when they plant their trees.Deputy Cuffe raised an interesting issue on rezoning of land outside town centres for supermarkets.  This may be not as noticeable in Dublin and other cities but it certainly has an impact.  Dublin City Council has battled with Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council over the construction of Dundrum Shopping Centre, which has had a significant impact on the city centre as a retail destination.  Dundrum clearly has its attractions but it has also sucked people from other shopping centres and the city centre.  This suited Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council because it brought vastly increased revenues which could be used to keep councillors and managers happy by making it easier to fund various schemes.  The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment received a number of submissions from city and town traders whose businesses are being suffocated by large shopping centres on the outskirts of urban areas.  Town centres cannot compete with the attraction of free and easy parking at these centres.  Small traders, many of whom have operated business in town centres for generations, have been badly affected.  This has been permitted by councillors in every local authority and we must also examine our own role as public representatives.The Bill before us will go some way towards dealing with the rezoning decisions made in the past several years by introducing a more robust and strategic planning system.  Over the past decade, Ireland experienced an unprecedented property boom which drove demand to such an extent that planning permission was granted in completely unsuitable areas.  In Milltown in my constituency, permission was sought for a development in an area which anybody could tell is subject to flooding.  I hope the local authority does not allow that to proceed.Over the past several months, we have seen pictures of inappropriate developments in rural areas.  Dublin's big advantage is that it does not have an extensive area of open land for development.  Dublin City Council has to build upwards or off-load people to the outskirts of the city.  We have all heard about the housing developments built on lands that were prone to flooding or without sufficient access to essential amenities.  This legislation will protect against that type of disjointed and fractured planning in the future and will ensure Ireland moves towards a more co-ordinated and holistic planning process in which the macro consequences of planning decisions are carefully considered and which supports and informs the targets outlined in the Government's national spatial strategy.  For example, the Bill provides that the relevant city or county manager must demonstrate how local development plans comply with the national spatial strategy and must ensure that topics such as growth scenarios, transport plans and rural development are taken into consideration.Correct planning decisions are pivotal to Ireland's future development and will feed into other policy areas such as transport, environment and community development.  This is supported in the Government's action plan Smarter Travel — A Sustainable Transport Future, which outlines the pivotal role spatial and transport planning will play in tackling urban sprawl and, by default, the challenge we face in regard to carbon emissions.  Under the Bill, local development plans must contain mandatory objectives for the promotion of sustainable settlement and transportation strategies in urban and rural areas and outline the measures that will lead to reduced emissions.Section 23 is a timely and sensible measure in the context of the financial difficulties being experienced by many people.  As I understand it, the current situation is that planning permission is only extended in cases where substantial works have been carried out prior to the expiration of that permission.  However, this provision means that planning permission may be extended in circumstances where substantial works have not been carried out.  This will be allowed to happen if there are commercial, economic or technical considerations.  For example, in the current climate many people seeking to develop or extend property are under financial constraints which may be beyond their control.  This provision will help applicants to plan ahead and to have some certainty within the planning process.  It will afford those applicants who cannot immediately proceed with a project as planned the opportunity to proceed when their personal circumstances improve or certain technical difficulties are ironed out without having to go through the entire planning process again.It is crucial that the planning process complements the national spatial strategy.  I welcome sections 24 and 25 which have regard to the need to develop infrastructure in the designated gateway towns outlined in the strategy.  The development of these locations in coming years and their projected population growth means there must be continued progress in providing them with the infrastructure necessary to support vibrant and sustainable communities.  To facilitate this concept, the Bill grants local authorities much greater flexibility to use development levies, where needed, on a broader range of infrastructure such as school sites, broadband provision and flood relief works.  The wider distribution of development levies is particularly welcome.  Rather than introducing additional levies the Bill provides local authorities with greater flexibility and control over the distribution of existing levies.The Bill provides that amendments to development plans will now require, rather than a simple majority, the support of two thirds of the total membership of a planning authority.  This is a welcome and sensible move which will require support from a significant bloc for any given proposal.  Moreover, it will reduce the scope for the lobbying of particular individuals or groups.  The measures in the Bill are progressive and well thought out.  They will result in a fairer, more constructive and more considered planning process.  I commend the Bill to the House.	spk_568
Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-12-09	dail	30	Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_12	I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate as a former member of the authority during my time as a Dublin city councillor.  It is important to note that many good initiatives were undertaken in the docklands leading to extensive community development, which transformed a derelict area into a vibrant community both on the north side and the south side.  Deputy Costello identified a number of projects on the north side that were not undertaken but the docklands must be considered in its entirely.  With regard to housing provision, it transformed people's lives, giving them great self-esteem.   They moved from miserable accommodation in the locality to decent, good quality accommodation and that has made a difference to individuals and the community at large.The Minister touched on a number of achievements in education and the authority's positive contribution in facilitating sporting organisations and groups.  Children and parents worked together on different projects to build their relationships, including fathers and daughters.  A new theatre will open in the area, which is positive, and various art exhibitions are held there, which have made a difference to the arts community.  The docklands is a good template for future planning because it integrated the existing small community into the new larger community.  The joining of the old community with the new vibrant community was almost seamless.  This did not happen in other developments.  As I stated at the joint committee meeting last week, there was a sense in the community at the time that this positive community development should be extended to Poolbeg.  People in Ringsend and further afield on both sides of the river said this made sense because it has worked.There are serious issues and Deputy Hogan's Bill has merit but it is great in hindsight to be able to say it was not a good idea.  This development should be considered as a template for an extension to Poolbeg.  I stated at last week's committee meeting that the merger of the authority with Dublin City Council should be examined.  This proposal has merit in that there is a great deal of crossover between both bodies.  However, the chairman made a strong case for retaining the authority as a separate entity.  It would be clean and clear.Deputy Hogan's Bill has merit but we have to wait on the two reports commissioned by the Minister.  The Bill is premature but not without merit.	spk_157
Chris Andrews	34	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-12-02	dail	30	Climate Change: Statements (Resumed). 	dbsect_39	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  From 7 December, for two weeks, environment Ministers and officials from around the world will meet in Copenhagen for the 15th UN climate change conference to thrash out a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, will represent Ireland at this critical summit where agreement on a new legal framework to tackling global warming from 2013 must be reached.I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  It is fair to that we have no one better or more committed than he to represent us.  He has spent all his political life, if not all his adult life, committed to the environment and we are very lucky to have a Minister like him representing us there.Today we heard the positive news that India, in common with the other major greenhouse gas emitters, China and the US, is likely to announce its emissions target in advance of next week's conference.  This shows real commitment that larger countries are now prepared to tackle the very real challenges of climate change.  Over the past decade and beyond, the larger countries did not make any great commitment to reaching their targets.Last week Ireland witnessed at first hand the devastating effects of climate change.  I listened to Mr. Gerald Fleming telling Cathal Mac Coille that in his opinion the unprecedented rainfall we have witnessed is more than just a freak event, rather it is the very real effects of global warming.  The awful scenes we have witnessed of families struggling to pick up the pieces of the lives, homes and businesses in which they have invested so much time and commitment drive home the reality that immediate action must be taken to combat the issue of climate change at an international level.The Government clearly recognises that we must also lead the way at home in Ireland on this issue.  A few weeks ago the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security discussed the committee's report which included outline proposals for a climate change Bill.  The report is a valuable input to development of a climate change Bill, the heads of which are now being developed.  There is clear all-party support for this legislation and in early December a framework document on the proposed legislation will be published.The recently reviewed programme for Government also reiterated the Government's commitment to climate change.  It stated that a new climate change Bill will give a statutory basis to the annual carbon budget incorporating a target of 3% annual average reductions on greenhouse gas emissions.There was also a commitment within the programme to introduce a carbon tax in the budget on 9 December along with an adjustment in the ratio of expenditure on new Transport 21 projects.  Between public transport and national roads programme, there will be a ratio of 2:1 in favour of public transport.  Certainly, that is an achievable objective if we are committed to it.Likewise, the Government's action plan, Smarter Travel — A Sustainable Transport Future, is a very positive development in the Government's response to the significant challenges presented by Ireland's transport system.  The plan recognises the need for a fundamental shift from private transport to more sustainable modes of transport.  I am pleased to mention one project, the new DART underground, currently at consultation stage, which on completion will treble the greater Dublin area's rail service capacity from 33 million passenger journeys annually to 100 million passenger journeys annually.  Its construction will be of enormous benefit to people and will be critical in assisting the shift from private to public transport.The action plan also highlights the pivotal role spatial and transport planning will play in tackling Ireland's urban sprawl and, by default, our carbon emissions.  The report recommends that the instance of urban generated one-off housing in peri-urban areas must cease and recommends general minimum housing density of between 35 and 50 dwellings per hectare in urban areas of suitable size and population, and requiring substantially higher densities where local circumstances warrant it.	spk_650

Dublin City Council is looking at its development plan and this brings challenges on heights and densities.  It is a difficult issue with which to deal.In the period 2008 to 2012, Ireland is required to meet a challenging greenhouse gas emission reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol.  This target is binding in international law.  In addition, by 2020 Ireland is committed under the EU climate and energy package agreed in December 2008 to achieve a 20% reduction on 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the sectors of the economy not covered by the EU emissions trading scheme.  This target is binding in EU law, as will be any adjustment to it in light of the outcome to the conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen next week.  Under a new international agreement on climate change, these cuts will become binding on Ireland.  I certainly support this Government which is determined in its efforts to tackle climate change on a national level through a climate change Bill and the introduction of a carbon tax.  This will lay the groundwork for achieving targets set under a new post-Kyoto international agreement.  In April this year, the Minister requested that the National Treasury Management Agency stop buying carbon credits abroad on the basis that Ireland will now meet its targets under the Kyoto Protocol due to the economic slowdown and the reduction in business here.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has asked the NTMA to put its programme of carbon purchasing on hold for the foreseeable future.  The Government clearly recognises that we need to move towards a low carbon economy at home and abroad to prevent increased poverty and catastrophic changes to the natural environment.Like many others, I am a newcomer to the issue of climate change.  We can certainly learn from the Green Party and that is why it is a benefit having that party in Government because of that commitment.  The Green Party's members have been long-time advocates of making changes at national and international level to improve our position.  I fully support the Government's efforts to tackle climate change and believe that we will make huge progress in this regard over the next year.	spk_654

Since it was first proposed, both the Minister and I have vigorously opposed the proposal to locate an incinerator at Poolbeg in Dublin.  One does not need to be an engineer to see that it does not make any sense to put an incinerator in what is effectively a large cul-de-sac.The proposed Poolbeg incinerator, which will be Dublin's first municipal waste incinerator and one of the largest such facilities in Europe, was granted planning permission by An Bord Pleanála in November 2007.  In December of last year, the proposed facility was granted a licence by the EPA.  The concerns of the local community about this facility are well known, with over 3000 objections registered with An Bord Pleanála.This week, the Irish Waste Management Association, IWMA, which represents almost 95% of private waste management collections in Ireland, released the findings of an independent report commissioned to examine the need for the proposed waste incinerator at Poolbeg.  The results of this report make worrying reading and reinforce the Minister's own point that this facility could end up costing the taxpayer up to €18 million per year over the next 20 years.  We must ask ourselves what we are thinking of in allowing the local authority to impose this extra tariff on the taxpayers of this country.The proposed plant has capacity to treat almost 600,000 tonnes of waste.  Under the current contract, which was negotiated by Dublin City Council, the State is required to supply 320,000 tonnes of waste annually to the plant.  If this is not reached, the State will be charged almost €90 for every tonne not supplied.  The council has said it is taking the long view, but by the time this incinerator reaches its capacity of 600,000 tonnes it is likely, given the considerable progress in research, that new technology will be in place.The cost to the State of not supplying waste is a deterrent to recycling and composting.  Its is also potentially anti-competitive to allow one operator to have such control over the market, and it could prove very costly to the taxpayer if these targets are not met.  Having to transport waste from the rest of the country to fill the incinerator would, in environmental terms, be robbing Peter to pay Paul, and would negatively offset any proposed benefits.I have made my opposition to the incinerator well known, and this report further compounds my concerns.  I do not believe Poolbeg is the correct location for a facility of this size and scale.  The increased traffic flow into the region will cause further congestion in an area that is already at saturation point.  It is similar to a car park in the mornings and evenings.  Dublin Bay itself is an area of high conservation importance and is legally protected under both the EU habitats directive and the EU birds directive.  Specific sites of conservation importance include the Liffey and Tolka Estuaries and Sandymount Strand, all immediately adjacent to the proposed development.  The incinerator is bound to have a negative impact on these amenities.The Minister is committed to reviewing the capacity of the incinerator.  If the capacity is found to be incorrect, I urge the Minister to make the appropriate changes and reconsider the future of the plant.	spk_346

Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-11-11	dail	30	Water and Sewerage Schemes.	dbsect_40	I welcome the opportunity to raise this Adjournment matter but in light of the previous one, it seems irrelevant.  Nonetheless, I welcome the opportunity to speak on it.  The Poolbeg chimneys are two of Dublin's most iconic structures.  I am sure everyone knows the candy stripe towers on the Poolbeg peninsula.  Poolbeg is adjacent to the now decommissioned Pigeon House generating station where electricity was first generated in 1903.The first or last things people see when approaching or leaving Dublin by air or sea are these chimneys and the Dublin and Wicklow mountains.  The candy-striped chimneys are among the tallest structures in Ireland and are visible from most of Dublin city.  No. 1 chimney is 680 feet and nine inches in height and No. 2 chimney is one foot higher.  They were designed to minimise atmospheric pollution and the towers now form part of Dublin's skyline and have been used as a backdrop to some of Dublin's most well-known films, pop and music videos and paintings, along with political literature from all sides of the political divide and none.  Over the summer there has been much speculation as to what will happen to the chimneys when the power station is decommissioned next year.  Media reports suggest that the ESB is considering their demolition.  I am against any such action.  Speaking to residents in Ringsend and Sandymount, Irishtown, Ballsbridge and Donnybrook, I know there would be strong opposition from the local community.Earlier this year, I wrote to the chief executive of the ESB to ascertain its plans for the towers and to put on record my opposition to any plans which would result in the demolition of the chimneys.  I received the standard response that no decision had yet been made about the chimneys.  Last year, a motion was tabled at Dublin City Council to have the chimneys added to the list of protected structures which would have made it illegal to demolish them.  This motion was rejected but the city planners recommended that a full assessment should be carried out should electricity generation cease at the plant.  I ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to seek a guarantee from the ESB that no decision will be made about the future of the chimneys without at least first consulting Dublin City Council, the Department and all other relevant stakeholders.If these towers had been designed by some famous architect or trendy designer, we would not be having this discussion because their demolition would not be permitted.  Given that these towers were accidental iconic structures, some people are of the view that they can be knocked down.  The social and historical significance of the chimneys is significant and I call for them to be given protected status.	spk_474
Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-11-10	dail	30	Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_21	I am glad the Minister is present for my contribution and I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the debate.The purpose of the Bill is to establish a modern system for the licensing of commercial public bus passenger services with the objective of promoting regulated competition in the provision of licensed public bus passenger services on a national basis and, more important, in the public interest.  The Bill also promotes integrated, well functioning and cost efficient public passenger transport services and provides for the introduction of new contractual arrangements for the procurement of public land transport services on a national basis, which is modelled on the approach established in the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 in respect of the greater Dublin area.  This legislation is critical and long overdue and I congratulate the Minister on taking a lead in this area.  As he highlighted in introducing the Bill, it is 77 years since the Road Transport Act was implemented but there is no comparison between the transport network of 70 years ago and that of today.  My grandfather closed most of the railway lines but there have been many changes since then.  They say the sins of the father are visited on the son but that is not quite the case here.A well functioning bus service is the backbone of any urban area.  Unlike in the United States, where taking the bus is seen as something that should be avoided, people of all ages take the bus in Ireland.  One can take it at any time of the day and one will see students, older people who may no longer wish to drive, parents with their schoolchildren and professionals as they make their way to work every day.  The quality bus corridor that runs through Stillorgan has been hugely successful.  Despite people at the time in RTE saying it would be an obstacle to commuters, it has been extremely successful.  My colleague, Deputy Mansergh, referred to the free transport scheme introduced by Fianna Fáil, which was, and is, of huge benefit to older people.  When people reach the age they are entitled to a free travel pass, they take it with great celebration and it reduces the sense of isolation they may feel.  In some cases they travel for the first time in decades and the extension of the scheme to Northern Ireland is welcome.A number of Members referred to the bus gate at College Green in Dublin.  While in theory the bus gate is a good idea, the timing of its introduction was not correct.  Retailers in the city centre are struggling with high rents and falling revenue and, while this is not all due to the bus gate, I favour suspending the scheme until the new bridges are in place next year.  There has to be a compromise on this matter that will benefit transport users and that will ensure Dublin centre does not become a retail graveyard.Public consultations were held earlier this year with older people around the country, who pointed out that access to mobility was critical to remaining connected with society.  The same is true in Dublin and the Luas is a transport success story.  One line runs right through Dublin South-East and it has made an impact on people living along the route.  It is much preferable to use light rail rather than the car.The Minister stated the objective of the legislation is the promotion of regulated competition on a national basis in the public interest, which is a critical issue.  The needs of those who use public transport must be at the heart of our transport policy.  As he said, commercial operators will always work to their own agenda, which is, unsurprisingly, to make a profit.  While competition is healthy, commercial operators cannot be allowed to select and cherry pick the routes that are most profitable with no consideration of less profitable routes and the social consequences of such decisions.The State has a responsibility to its citizens to provide a well functioning, cost effective and comprehensive transport system.  The Minister has done a great deal of work to ensure this vision comes about and section 10 is critical in this regard.  It sets out a range of matters in the application of bus licences and will ensure all applications must be considered in the context of potential demand for a proposed service having specific regard for the needs of customers.  I alluded to private sector companies trying to protect their position but the State agencies also seek to protect their position in the market.  While this reflects human nature, it is up to the State to regulate and that is why the Bill is important.The formation of the new National Transport Authority is a also a sensible step.  It makes sense to amalgamate agencies that deal with certain aspects of a particular system, in this case transport.  I hope it will lead to greater efficiencies and a more joined up approach to our transport policy in the coming years.  However there is no comparison between urban and rural transport systems and I warn against a one size fits all approach.  The Minister is aware of this and the legislation ensures such an approach will not be adopted.  I agree with the Minister that the Bill will bring greater clarity and fairness to the bus route licensing system and I welcome the fact that the needs of the people are at its core.  Urban and rural transport are subject to different demands and, therefore, the criteria for licences will be different.  I agree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh that the people want a good public transport system and the Bill will endeavour to provide that.	spk_281

They say that nice people do not succeed in politics, but in many ways Joe Doyle disproved this cliché.  We all get into politics to make a positive difference and it is safe to say that Joe Doyle made a positive difference.  He made a big difference within his community, within the wider community and within the body politic, which is so important.I was elected onto Dublin City Council in 1999 with Joe Doyle.  He never took advantage of my novice status on Dublin City Council despite my giving him plenty of opportunity to do so.  Joe loved people and loved Donnybrook, and people loved Joe Doyle.  He raised the bar on the body politic, and on standards in politics.  As Deputy Creighton stated, he is an example to all in politics.I wish to express my deep sympathy to Peggy, to David, to Michael and to Róisín.Members rose.	spk_81

Since I was elected in 2007, I have sought for Georgian Dublin to be nominated as a UNESCO world heritage site.

Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-10-15	dail	30	Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_5	I wish to share time with Deputy Fitzpatrick.I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak here today.  The revelations which came about regarding FÁS have shocked and outraged every person on both sides of the House and in wider society.  The measures included in this Bill are sensible and necessary given what has taken place.  They will go a long way towards restoring people's belief and confidence in the FÁS organisation.  The Minister has been very active in ensuring that everything possible has been done.  She has dealt with the various incidents and issues which have been thrown up through the revelations.  She has dealt with them very efficiently and effectively, despite what some people wish to portray.These measures will make a difference.  Some of the main measures include a reduction in the size of the board of FÁS from 17 to 11 people.  That is a very good thing.  Section 5 provides for the accountability of the director general of FÁS to other committees of the Oireachtas.  This section provides for the director general to attend any committee appointed by either or both Houses of the Oireachtas and give an account of the general administration of FÁS.  It is a very good measure in the legislation but I wish to see it go a little further.  I realise this has been mentioned before but I wish to see two or three members of the board appointed by the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has introduced a similar facility to the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.It would be a very positive thing and would give confidence to all Members.  It would send out a clear signal to wider society that there is a connection between the committee structures, appointments and important legislation.  It would also result in a greater involvement by the committee, of which I am a member, as are Deputies Michael Fitzpatrick and Arthur Morgan.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Callery is a former member of the committee.  It is one of the best committees around and I am sure people would agree with me on this point.  The committee is very well chaired.  Deputy Willie Penrose is a very proactive chairman and very facilitating to the members.  It is important to reward good committees and that good committees are involved more in terms of a greater role.  I am in favour of the appointment of two or three members by the committee but I do not wish to be prescriptive.  The Minister should take on board this suggestion which was made previously.A worker director should also sit on the board.  This would send out the right message to the staff in FÁS who must be reeling at present.  All they read is negative comment about the board of FÁS and this comment is not about the ordinary scheme or the ordinary person working in FÁS.  It is about a certain group or cabal of the FÁS hierarchy who have clearly abused their position.  The presence of a worker director on the board would send out a very positive message to the staff.  It is important that we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater.  The introduction of a rolling system of appointments to the board of FÁS is a very good idea.  It would cut out complacency, freshen things up and bring a new perspective to the board on an ongoing basis.  It would be a good and positive initiative in that regard.In my personal experience, most of the schemes are very positive.  For example, the community employment scheme provides a valuable service.  Deputy Creighton will also recognise the contribution that such schemes have made at Ringsend community centre and the St. Andrew's resource centre.  Over a period one can see an increase in the self-esteem of individuals who participate in community employment and job initiative courses.  They transform people's lives and makes them feel included in society.  They are also of huge benefit to the wider community by reducing social isolation and thus have a positive impact.  People are concerned that these schemes may be under threat but we cannot do without them, including the FÁS schemes.  I am not saying they cannot be changed or evolve, which would not be a bad thing, but the principle of having people working in the community through FÁS schemes is a good one.FÁS community training centres cater for early school leavers.  Young people's self-esteem benefits from these courses.  Education and training is so important in this regard.  Almost without exception, they become better citizens as a result of their participation in such schemes, being more involved in the community, which is a good thing for society as a whole.Job clubs offer practical advice and assistance to individuals seeking employment, which is a challenging position now.  The professional staff of the St. Andrew's resource centre are passionate about their jobs and believe they are making a difference.  They are having a positive impact on the community.It is important to acknowledge that there were problems in FÁS, including the misappropriation of funds, which is unacceptable.  Those responsible cannot be allowed to get away with it, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that FÁS is a good organisation which has made a positive difference within our communities.I would like to see provisions in the Bill for the dismissal of staff who are found to have acted inappropriately prior to the enactment of this legislation.  When the current investigations are concluded, those people should be fired from their jobs where they are found to be guilty.  In the private sector, if anybody was found to have signed off on an expenditure of €600,000 with nothing to show for it, they would not only lose their job but would also be prosecuted.  We must ensure that happens to people in FÁS where breaches are established.As I have said, however, the vast majority of FÁS staff are honest, hard working and give their utmost to the organisation.  Unfortunately, the public perception of FÁS has been destroyed by a small number of people.  This Bill will go a long way towards restoring the reputation of a body whose sole purpose is to assist and support people in the employment arena.  Over the years, FÁS has made a huge difference to communities, but that has not always been highlighted.  People may be sceptical about FÁS because of what they have read in the newspapers, but when they see how it functions they realise it does make a huge difference.I commend the Bill to the House.	spk_234

Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-09-24	dail	30	Courts and Court Officers Bill 2009: Second Stage. 	dbsect_5	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I had not planned on referring to the free legal aid system but I agree with the comments of Deputy Nolan.  I know the Minister is as committed as anybody to dealing with abuses of the judicial system but in difficult economic times the focus is on getting value for money.  There is a sense that free legal aid is being abused and if that if funding is available it should go to those genuine cases to which Deputy Nolan referred.The purpose of this Bill is to allow for the efficient operation of procedures at the new criminal courts of justice when they open in 2010.   That will be four months ahead of schedule, which is a positive delivery of services.Since the Courts Service was established in 1999, it has energetically and systematically pursued a programme of transforming the physical infrastructure of the courts.  This is extremely welcome.  It shows that despite the difficult times in which we live, projects are being undertaken and people are adhering to plans and delivering on them.  Not everything will be transformed overnight.  In Donnybrook and Pearse Street Garda Stations gardaí are housed in antiquated buildings making it difficult for them to be as efficient as they could be in a brand new building.  However, that development will happen.  In Irishtown in Dublin 4, for example, there is a new Garda Station which is a tribute to the Department and the Minister who delivered this fine project.  It makes it possible for everyone to be more efficient.The new complex to which we refer in this debate has 450 rooms, including 22 court rooms, and ancillary facilities based over ten floors and will provide vastly improved facilities for the public.  A very positive aspect of the new complex is that victims of crimes will have an easier experience than at present.  Those who come into contact with the judicial or criminal system find it stressful and upsetting at a vulnerable point in their lives.  If we can alleviate those difficulties and make a small difference to the interaction between the criminal system and victims we should do so.  This building will make it easier for people to navigate the courts system without coming into contact with people with whom they are in conflict.The formation of the Courts Service was recommended by a working group on a courts commission which was established by the Oireachtas in 1996. The group found that the Irish court system had remained largely unchanged since its establishment in 1924.  This had resulted in unacceptable delays in the determination of court cases.  In addition, staff throughout the courts system were poorly organised, given the antiquated structures within which they worked.  That is being addressed on an ongoing basis.  To combat those difficulties, the Courts Service of Ireland was established in 1999.It is nice to hear Deputy Rabbitte warmly welcoming this new building.  The effective operation of a court system is critical for the well-being of any society.  The built infrastructure and the human infrastructure must both be right.  The new complex goes a long distance towards that.  The new Criminal Court complex will be the first step in the modernisation of the service.  Given the scale of the building, it was necessary for the Courts Service, in consultation with the Garda and the Irish Prison Service, IPS, to give detailed consideration to how various work processes will operate when the building is up and running.  An efficient and modern service is a priority for all the parties involved.The Bill will provide for a modern and streamlined service which will best serve those who come in contact with it.  Part 2 will allow the IPS to manage the central holding facility for people in custody and have control of all persons, including those who have not been committed by the courts to prison.  That will make things more efficient and must be welcomed.  The Bill also allows for the temporary transfer of custody to a holding area for the purpose of facilitating a court appearance or the holding of a court hearing involving an accused person.  It is necessary to make legislative provision for this change so that the IPS may be responsible for the custody of persons in the holding cells in the courts.  Until now those people have been in the custody of the Garda.  The Bill will not affect the current arrangements for persons detained in the Central Mental Hospital who are required to attend court.  They will remain within the mental health service.Part 3 makes provisions to allow for improved staff management and flexibility by designating a single administrative office rather than an office for each court and each jurisdiction.  Many of the Bill's measures are practical and welcome.  Part 3 will modernise the court structures and allow for the integration of staff and efficient procedures.Part 4 will allow a District Court clerk to take bail recognisance in certain instances.  At present, when a District Court grants bail and the applicant is in a position to take up bail immediately subject to entering a recognisance, an applicant must be taken to the court office, complete the necessary documentation and then return to the court to enter recognisance before the judge.  This is time consuming and not altogether necessary.  This straightforward technical amendment will minimise the movement of prisoners around the court complex and free up judges' time for hearings.All of these measures are inherently sensible and will result in increased efficiencies in the prison service.  I look forward to the opening of the new building and I commend the Bill to the House.	spk_215
Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-09-24	dail	30	Dublin Mayor.	dbsect_22	I am concerned by the length of the dispute between Marine Terminals Limited, MTL, and the men and women working for the company in Dublin Port.  This dispute has resulted in pickets being placed on port installations by the workers who are opposed to the unilateral imposition of mass redundancies and cuts in pay and conditions by management.  This dispute is in its 13th week and MTL has exacerbated the situation by seeking several injunctions in the High Court against the people working there, trade union leaders and members of the local community.The company's refusal to engage in full industrial relations procedures has severely aggravated the situation and is damaging the image of the port.  I welcome the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Calleary, who as a former member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment is showing a great interest in his brief.  I call on him to ensure that all the dispute resolution machinery available, the industrial relations infrastructure, is deployed to resolve this dispute and ensure that MTL engages in a meaningful way, which it has not so far done in this dispute.  It must comply fully with the employment law of this State.MTL has shown a complete disregard for the workers and for employment law.  The men and women involved are not firebrands or radicals.  They are ordinary people whom I know, living in Ringsend.  They just want to get on with their daily lives, doing an honest day's work.  John Whittaker, who owns Peel Ports, is worth £1.3 billion yet he shows contempt for Irish legislation and work practices, and the local community around the port.  He wants to ride roughshod over these people and make more money to add to his estimated £1.3 billion.  It is sickening.  It is probably that sort of arrogance that has led us into the difficulty we face now.  People like him have ruined the banking system and the property market.On 27 August two men, Eddie Byrne from Ringsend, and Gerry Brannock, were on boats on the Liffey when small boat-owners staged a protest in support of the MTL workers.  Both were named in proceedings by the Dublin Port Company when it sought an injunction against the protestors in the High Court.  These two men have committed their lives to working for the community and are still involved in local community events.  They are old age pensioners.  Mr. Eddie Byrne is diabetic, suffers from various blood pressure issues and has an underlying heart condition.  He has to take up to 14 different types of medication every day.  Mr. Gerry Breathnach also suffers from blood circulation problems, has high blood pressure and had a stroke several years ago.Compassion must be shown in the attempt to pursue these men for costs because they are pensioners and are not able to deal with it.  Commonsense must prevail and the action of chasing these men for costs must be dropped.  The workers understand there may have to be redundancies but there has been no attempt to discuss such redundancies and this is not the way business should be done.	spk_327

This dispute has resulted in pickets being placed on port installations by the workers who are opposed to the unilateral imposition of mass redundancies and cuts in pay and conditions by management.  This dispute is in its 13th week and MTL has exacerbated the situation by seeking several injunctions in the High Court against the people working there, trade union leaders and members of the local community.The company's refusal to engage in full industrial relations procedures has severely aggravated the situation and is damaging the image of the port.

Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-09-22	dail	30	National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_18	"I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak.  I speak for every Member of this House when I state that the proposed legislation to establish NAMA is one of the most important and complex Bills to come before the House for debate.  Rightly, the discussion surrounding these proposals has been vigorous and intense, with every person on the island wanting to ensure that stability is restored to our banking sector, and the wider economy.In the past year, Ireland has been at the centre of one of the worst international economic storms ever witnessed.  This week, the G20 summit meets to discuss reform of the global financial sector, which has been rocked by banking scandals.  I know that people are angry and worried, just as Members on both sides of the Chamber are, and they have every right to be.  Action must be taken now if Ireland is to recover from this recession.The Minister for Finance and his Department has examined in detail every possible option available to them.  NAMA is generally accepted — not by everybody but rarely will we have unanimity on such complex legislation — as the best solution to restore our banking sector to a position of strength and it has received the support of the IMF and the ECB, with the ECB stating that measures in the legislation should restore confidence to the banking system.A recent article in The banking system is the heart of the economy.  At present, it is not working at full capacity and is not pumping much needed finance and cash into the economy, which it needs to stay healthy.  What do we do?  Do we simply allow it to fail, or do we perform an operation such as NAMA which may not be 100% risk free, but which will restore the banking system and the economy to full working order?Without a functioning banking system, the economy will not survive.  Families will struggle and businesses will fail.  The previous speaker spoke about a bank seeking €56 from a person.  This is the very reason we need NAMA; we need to be able to ensure that the banks can extend a certain degree of flexibility in loans.  There is nothing surer than that NAMA is the only option to restore stability to our banking sector.  The proposals for NAMA centre on two key points: buying bad loans at a discount and injecting capital into lenders with the aim of restoring solvency into the banking sector.  This will allow banks to once more free up lending to Irish businesses currently deprived of working capital.Over the summer I met representative bodies of a number of business associations to discuss the main challenges facing their members.  Repeatedly, access to credit was listed as the main concern for Irish SMEs.  NAMA will, by cleansing the banks' balance sheets, allow the banks to access cash to lend to businesses.  However, I know that there is deep concern that banks will simply sit on these funds and not pass the finance on.  Over the past five to seven years they borrowed heavily from foreign investors to help fund loans to property portfolios and there is concern that the money will be used to repay these foreign investors prior to being lent to the economy.  This concern has been highlighted by the ECB, which stated that the banks involved in the scheme must be monitored to ""ensure that their self-interest does not cause them to focus on preserving and rebuilding their own equity, instead of lending into the economy"".In his address to the Dáil last week, the Minister for Finance highlighted the commitment in the NAMA Bill that banks will increase their capacity for lending to the SME sector by 10%.  When amendments are being considered I ask that this commitment be clarified.  Unfortunately, although the same commitment was given when the banks received the Government guarantee last year, the experience of SMEs would tell a different story.  Though no one would suggest that a business that is not viable should be given funding simply because it seeks it, good businesses in operation today are being denied the credit they need.  We must ensure the banks do not pay off their foreign investors first but that a percentage of the money coming from the ECB goes to the economy.  From experience, we cannot trust the banks to deliver.  There must be a mechanism and, as the Minister stated, there must be reform of the culture in the banking system.  The Minister has provided this by cleansing the boards and this must continue.  That cultural change will ensure that the money goes to people and to small and medium enterprises.Earlier this summer I voiced my support for the Mazars proposal that a risk-sharing scheme be established for SMEs and I again propose that this be considered. Furthermore, I note with interest a proposal by the CPA that a condition be placed on the banks to ensure at least 25% of the €7 billion premium due to be paid for NAMA loans in accordance with long-term economic value will be allocated to new working capital credit facilities for viable SME businesses.  I suggest this proposal be given serious consideration when reviewing the legislation and that it be tied into it on a statutory basis.Ireland faces unprecedented economic challenges on a scale never before experienced and this Government has chosen a course of action to meet these challenges, which I fully support.  The Opposition has a duty and a right to question the Government on its decision-making process, however the time for proposing alternatives has passed.  Its duty to the people now is to work constructively with the Government parties to ensure the best legislation possible is passed.Ireland does not exist in a vacuum unseen by the rest of the world — a fact the Opposition seems to forget.  The international financial community is watching Ireland closely and it is critical that political point scoring is cast aside and that we work collectively to steer the country through this economic storm and these exceptionally difficult times.There is a phrase that familiarity breeds contempt; there should also be a phrase that pessimism breeds pessimism.  I do not for one second underestimate the seriousness of the situation we face.  However, it is paramount that Ireland Inc. send a strong and united message to potential investors that we can and will get through this and that Ireland is open and very much ready for business.  The very nature of our economy and our small size means that we are heavily reliant on international investment and a united, clear and decisive plan is the best way to reassure potential investors that Ireland is a safe place to invest.Any idea that builders will escape the consequences of their defaulted loans is a fantasy propagated by the Opposition to garner easy headlines.  A borrower who owes €1 million to a bank before the loan is transferred to NAMA will still owe €1 million to NAMA after it is transferred.  The Minister for Finance has assured this House that they will be pursued for every cent.  Any idea that borrowers will escape their obligations solely by having their loan transferred to NAMA is simply false.This Government has chosen a course of action.  It is a daunting task but our resolve to restore the Irish economy will not be shaken.  Every effort to protect the taxpayers and future generations has been taken and now the plan must be put into action.  Ireland can, and will, recover and NAMA is the first step on this road.  I commend the Bill to the House."	spk_380
Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-06-18	dail	30	Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_8	"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  As the previous speaker said, how we are perceived is important.  We need to ensure that Ireland is perceived as a safe place to do business.  That was not the case.  This Bill will help in many ways to repair the recent damage done to the reputation of the financial sector.  Its main purpose is to ensure that directors' financial dealings will be fully represented on companies' balance sheets which has to be good.It also provides welcome additional powers for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to access information held by companies or third parties that may be relevant to an investigation of corporate malpractice.  In addition to these measures, it increases the penalties for company officers whose companies provide loans to directors in prohibited circumstances and gives greater search powers to the authorities in cases of suspected corporate malpractice.The Bill follows the recent controversy in which directors of financial institutions received large loans, yet did not have to disclose them to shareholders in the company accounts.  We were all shocked, disappointed and angry at the disclosures last December that the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank had, over eight years to 2007, temporarily transferred loans from Anglo Irish Bank to the Irish Nationwide Building Society prior to the group's year end.  These loans amounted to over €87 million and the bank's shareholders were not aware of them.  Total loans to directors at that institution were in the region of €179 million and while this may not have been illegal at the time it was, in the words of the former chairman, ""inappropriate and unacceptable from a transparency point of view"".  That is putting it mildly because the damage that it has done and the anger it has created have undermined the economic and political foundations of the State.  That cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.  People must be dealt with in the most severe manner.Investigations into some of these matters are going on and I have every confidence that the right course of action will follow from them.  The public is angry about what went on in many of these institutions and that is as it should be.  I do not wish to pre-empt any of these investigations but anyone who is found to have abused his or her position must be held accountable.  In order to rebuild confidence in the economic and political foundations of the State, people must be held accountable.  I cannot emphasise that point strongly enough.Questions remain too about the behaviour of the former Financial Regulator who allowed these practices to happen.  I cannot fathom why he did nothing to prevent them.  It is hard to understand what was going through his mind at the time.  To some extent we all live in bubbles, but he must have been living on a different planet.  People who hold positions of authority, such as chairmen and chief executives, have a responsibility to behave openly and honestly to serve best the interests of the people they have been appointed to serve.  Unfortunately, as the lessons of recent months have shown, people cannot always be trusted not to abuse the faith placed in them.  There are people in every walk of life who betray the trust placed in them.  We must put in place legislation and systems to ensure that people comply with regulations and standards.While it is regrettable that those measures were not introduced previously, this Bill will ensure that the stakeholders will be protected from the practices that became known last year.  It sends out the message loud and clear that Ireland is deeply committed to holding companies and their directors to account.  It ensures that disclosure in company accounts of loans to directors of companies that are licensed banks will be treated in the same way as those in non-banking companies.  All loans above the minimum threshold to each individual named director must be disclosed separately in the annual accounts as opposed to an aggregate format.  The maximum sum outstanding during the year will be disclosed, not simply the sum outstanding at the end of the financial year.  It will also be an offence for companies, including banks, and their directors, not to comply with the disclosure provisions in the Companies Acts regarding loans to directors and connected persons and regarding the material interests of directors in company contracts.I also warmly welcome the increased powers afforded to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, including the greater powers to enter premises and seize documents.  In respect of the operations of Anglo Irish Bank, I am concerned that action must be taken as soon as the alarm bells ring.  The enforcement officers must act straight away.  There should be no time lag.  There is concern that there was a gap between the ringing of the alarm bells and the entry into the property.  The power to seize documents will enhance and assist in the investigation of malpractice.I commend the Minister and her staff on their work on this Bill which will go a long way to restoring Ireland's reputation and reassure people not just here, but internationally that Ireland is a safe and trustworthy place to do business."	spk_257

More than 1 million people in Ireland work in the small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector and in effect, it comprises the backbone of the Irish economy.  People who start up businesses and who try to create employment have vision and the Government will not be found wanting when it comes to supporting them.  Figures released by the Small Firms Association yesterday point to the fact that SMEs are doing everything they can to remain competitive and it is the Government's responsibility to assist them in this regard.  I assure small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as people with the vision to make a difference in the community, the economy and this country that they will have the Government's support.  When speaking with SME owners a number of issues repeatedly arise, the most frequent of which concerns the difficulty of securing credit.  The Government clearly is taking difficult measures to ensure that credit will begin to flow and there are signs that this is beginning to happen.A particular issue that has been brought to my attention by many businesses in Dublin South East concerns rents.  In recent months, several traders have contacted me about attempts to increase commercial rents even though trade has decreased dramatically in some cases.  The most disappointing aspect is that many of the property owners are the financial institutions or the asset management arms of financial institutions, which are availing of the Government's bank guarantee scheme.  I also was disappointed to learn this week of the difficulties being experienced by traders under the remit of the Temple Bar Cultural Trust.  I have called for the city manager of Dublin City Council to take an active role in ensuring that a realistic approach to current rents is taken.  Temple Bar Cultural Trust is a not-for-profit organisation under the control of Dublin City Council and although it was set up to promote the area as both a cultural hub and as a bustling thriving small business precinct, virtually since its inception it has failed to understand the needs of small businesses, with the exception of the pub trade, which traditionally has had a disproportionate influence in the Temple Bar area.In addition, the new Labour and Fine Gael-controlled city council should ensure that Dublin City Council reduces the cost burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.  Both rents and rates must be frozen, at the very minimum, in Dublin City Council.	spk_608

Ireland is in a good position because we are first for real corporate taxes, investment incentives, foreign investor freedom and skilled labour.

I wish to refer to the community that will be affected by An Post's decision to close the post office in Ringsend.  The closure of the post office will have a detrimental effect on the old people who live in this community and who use the services provided at the post office, which is situated right in the heart of Ringsend.  The communities in the Ringsend-Irishtown area are long established and many elderly people live there.  Everyone who lives in the area — the old and young families and couples — frequent the local barber shop, the butcher's shop and the newsagent.  All of these individuals will be affected by the decision to close the post office.The decision was taken to close the post office because the business was no longer viable.  However, instead of identifying another shop in the area that might host the post office, An Post decided to move it out of Ringsend village altogether.  In my opinion, not enough research was carried out in respect of transferring the business to another shop in the area.  I understand An Post is currently carrying out such research but it is far from certain whether the post office will remain in the Ringsend-Irishtown area.  An Post wants to move the post office a significant distance from Ringsend to Barrow Street.  As a result, the elderly will not be able to access it.Most older people go out each Friday to meet their friends, chat and collect their pension payments from their local post office.  Post offices are part of the social infrastructure not just in Ringsend, but in towns and villages throughout the country.  They ameliorate the effects of social isolation and allow people, particularly the elderly, to be independent and to meet their friends.  The community in the Ringsend-Irishtown area is great.  Removing the post office from the village would represent a real blow to the older people who live there.  In many ways, its removal amounts to ripping the heart out of the community in the Ringsend-Irishtown area.It is astounding that the Minister with responsibility for An Post is unwilling to meet the residents or the public representatives who have expressed concern about this matter.  This issue is too important to be managed by a Minister at arm's length.  The Minister must intervene and take charge of matters.If we are going to protect our urban villages, we must also protect our post offices.  In recent days I met a woman who was on her way to the post office in Ringsend and who was devastated when I informed her that it was intended to close it.  Her main concern was that she would no longer be able to travel to the post office on her own and would in future be dependent on a neighbour to get her there.  This woman is going to lose her independence as a result of what is happening.Saving the post office in question is vital to the survival of the villages of Ringsend and Irishtown.  If the post office closes down, the butcher, the newsagent, the other shops and the public houses in the area will all lose out financially.  The effect of the closure will be extremely detrimental.  I ask that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, intervene and take some responsibility for this matter.  He should not allow the mandarins in An Post to determine whether our urban villages survive.	spk_784

Last September, the Government announced that it would increase the statutory limit for the deposit guarantee scheme for banks and building societies from €20,000 to €100,000 per depositor, per institution.  Subsequent to the Minister's announcement, the European Commission issued a discussion document on updating the EU directive on deposit guarantee schemes.  The European Council and European Parliament passed Directive 2009/14/EC.  The changes made in this new directive are incorporated in the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Bill 2009 and its associated regulations.  This Bill will extend and modify cover to all credit institutions in the State and will cover depositors in banks not supported under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.The measures announced in the Bill will increase the deposit protection limit to €100,000 from €20,000; remove co-insurance in order that the total of deposits up to €100,000 are protected and not a fraction as in the previous scheme; reduce the minimum time period within which depositors must receive their guaranteed deposit from three months to 20 working days; move the responsibility of this area of financial regulation back to the Central Bank from the Financial Regulator; and extend the protection to depositors and shareholders of credit unions who were not covered in the previous scheme.  That has been covered.I commend the Minister for Finance, who acted very decisively last September on this matter, which was of great concern.  Much speculation had been mounting among consumers that Irish bank deposits were not secure, with a number of people going so far as to withdraw their savings, with the consequent difficulties.  People were discussing whether their money was safe in the banks.  This would have undermined our entire economy.  Allowing this to continue unaddressed would have had a serious effect on one or all of our banks, as without the liquidity of deposits banks simply could not function.The steps taken by the Minister for Finance reassured the public and demonstrated the Government's commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.  Measures taken since have shown that commitment.  The Minister has acted assuredly and with great clarity.  The guarantee offered by the State is among the highest in Europe — I understand only one other country offers a higher guarantee.  As we are all aware, Ireland, with the rest of the world, has since found itself in the midst of the worst financial recession in more than 70 years.  At national level the Government has taken necessary steps to stabilise the domestic banking system to ensure we have a healthy and sound banking system that meets the needs of the economy.  The measures announced in the Bill represent just one of these steps.  I note that previous speakers discussed NAMA.  While the Opposition is working out the theory of how NAMA works, I have no doubt the Government will ensure NAMA works in practice.Both at home and abroad changes are taking place in the financial sector in terms of regulatory approach, which is welcome.  We need transparency and cannot be rigorous enough in ensuring we have such transparency.  We also have improved international co-operation, risk management, etc.  This will no doubt lead to a changed, but I hope far more stable and realistic financial sector.  It is critical that the lessons of recent months are learned.  The measures presented in the budget in April regarding the banking sector will, I am sure, rebuild confidence in our financial system, but it will not happen overnight.  By steady management the measures announced in the Bill will assist in that process.  I certainly support the Bill.	spk_296
Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-06-11	dail	30	Ryan Report on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse: Motion (Resumed). 	dbsect_7	"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is difficult to adequately express in words the sadness and shame I felt on reading the Ryan report, which highlights one of the darkest and upsetting periods in our history.  As a citizen, I feel ashamed that we, as a nation, could allow the perpetration of widespread, long-term abuse on some of our most vulnerable young people while in the guardianship of the State.As Deputy Michael Ahern stated, great credit is due to those who were willing to speak about their personal experiences and bring information about them into the public domain.  Given the private nature of their experiences, it must have been difficult for victims to speak out about such events in an open manner.  In publicly discussing their experiences, they have, however, done the country a service in showing how people can set aside their humanity and behave in the most awful manner.The Ryan report documents a shameful catalogue of physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect which was permitted to continue for decades.  Earlier today, a man named Andy Smith related to me his experiences in the Daingean reformatory school.  People descended to committing acts of depravity and while we would like to believe we are above such behaviour, I am not sure that is true.  In the right circumstances people are able to set aside their humanity without difficulty.The abusers were sheltered by a culture of silence and denial and children who spoke out were disbelieved and accused of telling lies.  I listened to Mr. Michael O'Brien, a victim of abuse, tell his story on the ""Questions and Answers"" programme and was struck by his honesty and bravery.  His account of the abuse perpetrated against him as a young boy drove home to me and the entire nation that there are people among us who still live with the horrors inflicted on them.  Nothing can make up for the abuse suffered by Michael O'Brien, Andy Smith and many others like them.  Nothing will ever take away the nightmares they have and the fear and emotional problems they endure.  We must do everything in our power to ensure some measure of justice is granted to them.While I understand the indemnity deal concluded in 2002 cannot be reopened, the religious orders must act on the commitment they gave to establish an additional fund to compensate victims of abuse.  It was disappointing, to say the least, to learn that in some cases the religious orders had not met the funding commitment they gave in 2002.  They must act without reservation to prove they are genuinely committed to helping those who were seriously mistreated in their care.  Apologising is the easy part; apologies must be sincere, genuine and backed up by action.The Government also has a pivotal role to play.  We must show our commitment to the victims of abuse and future generations of young people by implementing immediately the recommendations of the Ryan report.  Appropriate structures and resources need to be put in place to ensure the safeguarding of children and we must always remain vigilant in this regard to ensure that we do not come remotely close to allowing anything like this happen again.My school days, like those of Deputy Kennedy, were pleasant.  I have pleasant memories of Willow Park and of Newpark comprehensive school.  All children should be entitled to happy school days and happy memories of school.  It is essential that as a society we ensure that our children feel safe and happy going to and coming home from school.We must accept that these abusers could not have acted as they did were it not for the systemic failures of the State and church in meeting their responsibilities.  I would ask that we closely examine our care system to ensure that the needs of our children are the priority.  Supervision, transparency and, as Deputy Michael Ahern stated, openness must be always at the forefront in our child care system.It is a wonderful experience watching my children going to school happy.  Education must be about the enjoyment of learning.  They come home happy and they go to school happy.I commend the Taoiseach and the other members of the Cabinet on their actions so far and I welcome the proactive approach they have shown by meeting with both the victims of abuse and the religious orders.  These meetings were a step in the right direction but it is important that the momentum is not allowed to wane.  We must maintain this momentum because this issue is just too important to be sidelined.Trust in the religious orders has been severely eroded, not only because of this report but because of other reports of abuse that have come to light in recent years.  However, I want to take this opportunity to put on record that while some individuals in the religious orders took part in this abuse and many others are just as guilty, in my opinion, as they allowed it happen by standing by and not intervening, we must recognise that there are good people who have dedicated their lives to making a difference for younger people and their community and it must devastate them to read this damning report on their peers.  We cannot tar everybody with the same brush.  During the summer I was in the Gambia where I met with an Irish bishop of the Holy Ghost order who was continuing to make a significant difference to his adopted community.Archbishop Martin stated this week that Pope Benedict XVI was visibly upset by accounts contained in the Ryan report.  I am heartened to hear that the Pope has urged justice to be done for all the victims.  I sincerely hope that these words will not ring hollow over the coming months and years.  Both church and State now have an opportunity to right the wrong that has been done and if we act accordingly, we may also at least be able to hold our heads up in years to come and state we did all we could to make up for the horrors suffered by countless young people.Yesterday's march of solidarity saw thousands of people gather outside to show their support for the victims of these abuses.  The dignity with which they conducted themselves was astounding.  I only hope that we can follow their example of honesty and bravery and ensure that the right action is taken now."	spk_184
Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-05-27	dail	30	Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_31	I am delighted to speak on this Bill.  The vast majority of Irish people are decent and law-abiding and are entitled to live without fear of being the target of criminal activity in any form.  As legislators, it is up to us to do everything we can in the fight against crime.  We have all been shocked by the increasing brutality of crime and the way criminal gangs carry out business.  Individuals carry out crimes without a second thought.Last week in Dublin South-East a young mother, Esther Uzell, whose brother Joseph Rafferty was killed a number of years ago, declared that she would run as an Independent candidate in the local authority elections.  Only three nights ago, her car was smashed to bits at 1.30 a.m. by five hooded people.  They destroyed her car, shouted abuse at her apartment and called for her and her husband to come out.  This was an act of serious intimidation by thugs, whom scum is the more accurate description.  They have been intimidating this family over the years and this is unacceptable.  The Garda Síochána has put in a substantial number of man hours in trying to identify the people who killed Joseph Rafferty.  These people can do what they want without feeling they could be apprehended.  Having met the Garda Síochána about this and other matters, I have no doubt their time will come and they will be caught.  The Garda Síochána is unrelenting in pursuit of these individuals, to the credit of the force.The increase in the use of firearms and in knife crime has been well documented.  Reports suggest that gardaí are seizing an average of 500 firearms a year.  I welcome the provisions in this Bill.  As legislators we must give the Garda Síochána the necessary powers and this Bill is one part of the jigsaw to make society safer.  The 500 firearms seized every year is a considerable figure and makes a positive impact on reducing crime.  I welcome the provisions in this Bill that set out to tackle the issue, particularly the handgun ban and the application of much tougher penalties for individuals found in possession of knives.  Knives are particularly nasty weapons and it is important to deal with this area.As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform outlined, handguns were effectively banned in the State until 2004.  However, due to a number of judicial decisions, that is no longer the case.  Some 1,800 handguns have been licensed, an alarming figure.  I fully support the actions in this Bill to ban the ownership of handguns.These proposals have received the backing of the Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate, Ms Kathleen O'Toole, who is drawing on her considerable experience in the United States.  We must ensure we do not end up with a culture similar to the United States, where almost anyone can purchase a firearm with little or no restriction.  The devastation the unregulated selling of guns causes in American society was most recently reinforced by the rise in school shootings.  The Virginia Tech massacre and the shooting in Germany, which resulted in 16 deaths, is an indication of the road we could travel.  We must ensure that we do not travel down this road and this legislation assists us in this regard.	spk_537

I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill which the Minister published last week.  It gives effect to the measures announced in the emergency budget of 7 April.  As the Minister has stated, the Bill strikes a difficult balance between the need to show a credible way forward for dealing with our structural problems and also the need to protect the economy.  Like everything in life, it is about balance and this budget is a very balanced contribution towards getting us back on the right track.The Bill contains measures that, although difficult, are necessary to stabilise the economy.  I welcome the decisive action taken by the Cabinet and the Minister for Finance in dealing with this economic crisis.  The Bill outlines the six essential steps we must undertake for financial renewal, namely: stabilising our public finances; restoring our damaged banking system; regaining competitiveness; protecting the jobs we have and investing in retraining those who have lost jobs; supporting and stimulating economic confidence as much as we can within the resources available; and, crucially, restoring our reputation abroad.	spk_454

In this Bill, the Government has spread the burden as fairly as possible and has ensured that those who can afford to pay the most will carry most of the pain.  For example, the plan to close a potential capital gains tax legal loophole allowing Irish resident companies disposing of shares in other companies to avail of what is termed a ""participation exemption"" where the shares derive their value from exploration or exploitation rights is very welcome.The Bill aims to provide support to people who lose their jobs and I am glad to note that redundancy payments made in the first four months of the year will not be subject to the higher income levy rates introduced in the supplementary budget.  This is only fair to people who have found themselves faced with the uncertainty and difficulty of unemployment.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise Trade and Employment and the Joint Committee on Finance I very much welcome the move to reduce the rates of interest applied by Revenue to late payments and underpayments of tax by businesses.  These will come down by approximately 20% to annualised rates of between 8% and 10% from 1 July.  This will ease pressure on businesses which are finding things very difficult in the current economic climate.I also very much welcome the introduction of a scheme of tax relief for the acquisition of intangible assets, including intellectual property.  This measure enhances Ireland's competitiveness as a location for the development of intellectual property, and it links in with the aims outlined by the Government in Building Ireland's Smart Economy.  The smart economy plan launched late last year aims, through investment and incentives, to reach a research and development target of 2.5% of GNP by 2013.  We have already trebled our economy-wide research and development spend over the last decade.  Again, this will be dismissed as inconsequential.  This spend is approximately €2.5 billion of which some two thirds comes from the enterprise sector.  This refocusing of our economy will ensure Ireland's long-term future and viability.The Government is doing everything in its power to take the hard decisions that ensure Ireland returns to growth as quickly as possible.  There are four corner-stones to the Government's strategy."	spk_467

This measure will restore the credit flow to businesses which are in critical need of working capital The second pillar is concerned with attacking the gap in our public finances by increasing revenue and cutting spending, in a planned way, over the next five years.  Difficult choices have been and will have to be made, but it is in the best interests of the economy and the country.  The third pillar is concerned with protecting as many jobs as we can, restoring competitiveness to the way we do business and supporting viable businesses which are vulnerable.

Clearly we are in difficult and challenging economic times.  The decisions we will need to make will be very difficult but they will need to be made.  Of course it is never easy to take money away from people or reduce their income, but that will need to be done across the board, because we need to make ourselves more competitive in a global context.  We are not doing it just for ourselves.  We are doing it to ensure that other countries, international markets and international political institutions realise that Ireland can and will make the difficult decisions.  While geographically we might be an island, politically and economically we are not.  We export 80% of all we produce.  Our relationship with other countries is vital and their perception of us is vital.  With this budget the Government has grasped the nettle.  As has been said it will be the first of five difficult budgets with four more to come.  It will not get any easier in the short term.  It could be said that if we do not take the unpleasant medicine now we will be taking much more unpleasant medicine for significantly longer.There are a number of aspects to the Bill, one of which relates to rent supplement.  As it stands 84,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement, which is a very large number of people.  That rent supplement provides support for those for whom local authority housing is not an option in the short term.  It also acts as an umbrella for those at risk of homelessness.  A previous speaker mentioned that landlords would be happy to sit on their flats or apartments without having tenants and getting rent.  I do not believe that is the case.  Landlords with property will want to rent it out.  They are pragmatic and if that means they will be renting it out at a reduced rate, they will do so.  They certainly become more pragmatic when the banks are chasing them down looking for their payments.  Landlords will not happily refuse to reduce rents and have a vacant flat rather than getting some level of income, albeit somewhat reduced.  An occupied flat with an income coming through is the likely result.Like other Deputies, I have received a number of e-mails stating that the reduction in rent supplement should not lead to homelessness.  It is exaggerating to suggest that this measure would lead to homelessness — I do not believe it will.  There may be individual cases where landlords refuse to reduce the rent.  However it is not beyond the wit of man, the local authorities or social welfare to deal with the consequences of a few belligerent landlords.  The State should not be held to ransom to line the pockets of a few landlords who do not believe they should move with the times and reduce rent.  Landlords are pragmatic and will reduce rents when it is put to them.  The State is spending more than €490 million on rent supplement and it is vital that we get value for money.  It is necessary for us to cut our cloth to measure.  Landlords cannot be allowed to get away with charging high rents.Today I spoke to private tenants who are moving from a very small flat with two single bedrooms.  They had a contract from over a year ago and were being charged more than €1,500 for that flat.  They are taking their time in moving because there is a significant reduction by landlords in the rents they are charging.  They are looking at a large two-bedroom apartment in a very nice area in the docklands in my constituency of Dublin South-East which is available at €1,100.There is, therefore, a significant saving.  I see no reason the State should not benefit from a reduction in rents, particularly when costs across the economy are reducing.  I see no reason that some landlords should try to hold onto the higher rents or imply they might make people homeless.  They should not be allowed get away with that.  The State cannot base its legislation on being held to ransom by such landlords.Another aspect of the Bill is the imaginative and innovative proposal to provide a free preschool year for children.  The early child care supplement that preceded this cost the State €480 million in 2008.  We must cut our cloth to measure and ensure that we get value for money.  The early childhood care and education scheme does this in an innovative way.  There has been much discussion about the loss to families caused by the loss of the supplement.  It seems to me that does not focus on the purpose of the exercise, namely, care for children, as evident from the term ""child care""."	spk_665

Most facilities have small margins and low pay and are very vulnerable to a reduction in the number of parents who send their children to child care facilities following a reduction in their incomes.

I was interrupted when I said he said that if we had the commitment, we had intelligent government.  He went on to say we could therefore expect to see a similar approach in other areas.  I think that is true.  We can expect to see a similar approach and innovative decisions being made.The Labour Party's most recent policy document on child care and preschool education dates back to approximately 2005 and probably needs some dusting down.  That document argued for an early year's care subsidy that would cost over €1 billion per annum and also wanted a year of preschool education costing €163 million per annum.  When those documents are dusted down, the Labour Party will realise our current proposal is a good and innovative scheme.A significant number of community child care facilities are in place.  For example, not far from here we have the St. Andrew's Resource Centre and the centre at City Quay.  These provide an excellent service for young people and have given a broad welcome to this proposal.  We have yet to see the detail, but if people try to work with the proposal we will see positive results.  The recent National Competitiveness Council report on education and training suggests that pre-primary education is a key determinant of student performance at all levels of education, as it leads to improvements in students' skill levels, motivation and the propensity to learn, which in turn raise the private and social returns from all future investments in their education.The scheme, therefore, is about ensuring that children get care at an early stage.  People from disadvantaged areas or areas where children are at risk of becoming involved in antisocial behaviour often say they spotted this when a child was as young as three years old.  We need intervention when the child is that age.  This scheme is part of early intervention and of ensuring that children get a good start in life so that they are well prepared to go into more formal education later.  The real winners from this scheme will be the more disadvantaged and marginalised children in society who do not currently benefit from preschool care and education.Barnardos and the Children's Rights Alliance have welcomed this scheme.  In a debate on the issue, the Children's Rights Alliance asked what costs more, maintaining and developing early years education or not doing so at all.  For every euro spent on early years education, a return of up to €7.10 can be expected.  Investing in such education has proved effective in the long run in terms of promoting social skills, improving the life chances of children born in disadvantaged communities and reducing criminal activity.  What could be a smarter investment?  These comments were made on Thursday, 2 April and the situation has not changed since.  We must give our children the best chance in life that we can.For a child brought up in a chaotic family, going to child care providers might be a respite.  We used to send my two children to pre-school for three hours per day.  It was beneficial for them because they learned how to socialise and about boundaries.  It prepared them for primary school.I welcome the Bill.  The reduction in the rent supplement is good, as it will ensure that landlords cannot hold the Government and the economy to ransom.  I happily support the Bill, which is imaginative and clever governance.	spk_687

I regret the Deputy is leaving the House.  It is difficult to understand how Deputy Durkan reached the conclusion that the private sector has remained untouched other than by a few job losses.  Also, it is difficult to understand his theory that the global downturn has not yet impacted on us here.I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  On 7 April, the Government will take the necessary steps in terms of its presentation of a supplementary budget to the Irish people.  While many of the measures introduced will be difficult, I believe they will be fair.  We are all aware of the need for fairness.  It is always difficult to get the balance right.  The Government is working hard to ensure those who can afford the most will pay the most and that the most vulnerable in society are protected as far as possible.Clearly, Ireland is facing unprecedented economic challenges on a scale never before experienced.  It is critical people work together and in that regard I welcome the new engagement with the social partners.  It is a positive move which indicates a new realisation by a large sector of stakeholders in society that the situation is as bad as indicated.  The country's finances have been worsening rapidly since October of last year.  I believe the budget will provide the Government with an opportunity to pre-empt a worsening of our finances.The budget will, I hope, have a number of positive effects, the most vital of which is that additional and much needed revenue will be raised for the Exchequer, thus narrowing the gap in our public finances.  Our economy has worsened far more rapidly than anyone could have anticipated.  Total tax revenue at the end of 2008 was €40 billion, some €6 billion less than that taken in the previous year.

It is clear that people are concerned and worried.  As stated, there is no silver bullet, magic wand or road map to follow because nobody has been through this before.  The constant drip of negative news in the past couple of months, over which the Government had no control, has eroded public confidence and made people wary of what is to come.  With the new budget in place, people will be able to accurately assess their financial situation and begin to plan and, it is hoped, spend once more.On Ireland's international reputation, a well thought-out and planned budget will help to repair some of the damage done in recent months in terms of the negative effect the banking difficulties have had on our reputation.  It will help to restore international confidence in our economy and our ability to manage it.	spk_505
Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-03-25	dail	30	Pre-Budget Statements (Resumed). 	dbsect_23	We must get the balance right.  While it might be tempting to cut spending on vital infrastructure for short-term gain, I hope the budget will take the long-term view and provide for investment in major infrastructure.  Obviously, not all infrastructural projects can be delivered upon within the original timescale.  We must prioritise and I believe we will do so.  Caution is necessary in terms of the capital expenditure programme.A balance must be achieved between taking money out of the economy and protecting jobs and investing to increase our capacity to compete and deferring projects that are not necessary now thus releasing money for more immediate concerns.  It is important the correct balance is achieved between cutting expenditure and raising taxes and borrowing.  As I said earlier, there is no magic wand that can fix this.  What we need is a plan.  Recovery will take time.As previous speakers stated, we must protect the vulnerable in society.  They must not become easy targets.  Carers have been engaging with public representatives on all sides.  We cannot afford to send out the wrong message to carers who in effect work 24 hours a day, seven days a week and save the economy a great deal more than is paid to them.  Also, they play a vital role in terms of society wherein social isolation is unfortunately becoming more prevalent.  In the absence of the national carers strategy there are cost neutral measures that could be introduced that would benefit carers.  We could promote the sharing of the carer's allowance by two carers providing care on a part-time basis.  There is a lack of awareness in regard to people's entitlements and how the system operates.  This proposal would be a cost neutral measure and would send out the right message to carers.A family carer awareness training programme should be developed in collaboration with relevant stakeholders such as the Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs and the HSE.  It should be delivered to frontline staff in all relevant statutory agencies on a phased basis.	spk_507
Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-03-25	dail	30	Pre-Budget Statements (Resumed). 	dbsect_23	It would not cost an arm and a leg to establish such a programme.  It would send a positive message to carers while costing almost nothing to deliver.  I suggest that we draw on existing resources in Departments to create an interactive national website that is dedicated to family carers.  We should support carers in such a cost-effective manner.  We need to remind family carers that any failure on their part to make contributions to their pensions while they are providing care might affect their eligibility for the old age contributory pension.  If that message were transmitted, it would help carers, who have a difficult job and an important role.  This budget gives the Government an opportunity to put the country on the road to economic recovery.  I am sure the right steps will be taken to ensure we are in a good position when that recovery comes about.	spk_509

Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-03-03	dail	30	Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2009: Second Stage. 	dbsect_23	I wish to share time with Deputy Michael McGrath.  I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak. The National Pensions Reserve Fund represented a move towards a part pre-funded public pension system.  It involves the statutory setting aside and investing of 1% of GNP annually.  Currently the fund is valued in the region of €16.5 billion.  Late in 2008, due to a number of factors, national and international, and coupled with the ongoing turmoil in global financial markets, the Government initiated intensive discussions with several banks with a view to securing their position.The Government decided on a comprehensive recapitalisation package, which will reinforce the stability of our financial system, increase confidence in the banking system here, and facilitate the banks involved in lending to the economy.  Every day we hear of the difficulties of viable small and medium enterprises in accessing credit and cash.  Such small and medium sized enterprises are struggling and must be given support.  This measure will go some way towards doing so.  Further steps will be required in addition to the steps already taken.  There is no magic wand and no one silver bullet that will solve everything.  Everything cannot be neatly packaged into one small box and rolled out on one day.  Given the current turmoil and the meltdown of the financial markets it is very difficult to predict what will come next.  I note the comments of an economist who stated that what was needed was small steps not giant leaps.  This measure is one small step that will assist the economy and small and medium enterprises.The purpose of the Bill is to allow moneys from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to be used for this programme of recapitalisation and I support this proposal.  The plan will see €3.5 billion invested in each bank, the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, in return for preference shares with a guaranteed dividend of 8%.  There is concern in some quarters that 8% may not be sufficient but it was the case in other countries that a higher dividend had to be reduced subsequently.  This dividend is balanced and good and the Government will also have the right to appoint one quarter of the number of directors at each bank and obtain one quarter of ordinary voting rights at board meetings.  In return for the funding, both banks have agreed that bonuses for staff will not be paid for activities in 2008 and 2009.  While salaries for senior executives will be cut by at least 33%, the banks have also agreed to increase lending to small business by 10% and to first-time buyers by 30%.  This will be welcomed by all those involved and those who appreciate the serious demands on small and medium enterprises.An effective banking system is vital for business and consumers alike and is essential to Ireland's economic recovery. The recapitalisation of these banks will have a positive impact on the ability of businesses to acquire finance and maintain business activity.  Recapitalisation will boost confidence and will send a strong message to the domestic and international business community that Ireland is a safe place in which to do business.Businesses are really struggling.  The reduction in gas and electricity prices is a very good step and must be a great relief to both the residential and the business consumer.  Businesses are finding it difficult to pay rent and rates and local authority charges.  In Grafton Street, not too far from here, there are proposals for bids for district improvement which is also adding on charges for additional services.  While these services are very welcome and the bids concept is a good proposal, it imposes a heavy burden on many businesses which are already struggling.  I heard of one landlord who was seeking to increase the rent.  It is amazing that anyone would try to do that at this time——	spk_321

Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2009-02-24	dail	30	Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_25	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The purpose of the legislation is to provide for the payment of a contribution by persons in the public service, including Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and certain other office holders, who are members of an occupational pension scheme or a pension arrangement.As regards today's investigation on Anglo Irish Bank, like everybody else in the House, I am angry with the behaviour of senior bankers.  There clearly was a small, cosy group of business people who felt that regulation was for little people.  They felt they were untouchable and if the global financial meltdown had not occurred, they could well still be untouchable.  Today's action by the Garda Síochána and the ODCE is welcome but it is and must remain a matter for them.  I hope this will be the first step in restoring the trust that ordinary people have lost in the banks and also, it must be said, in the political system.  We must allow this investigation to take its course.  It would be easy to hit out and name everybody we believe is guilty of these banking crimes.  We would feel much better if we were able to name and shame everybody, but it would not necessarily mean that justice would be brought to those who deserve it.  These bankers lost their moral compass, but we must not say anything that will let them get away with their crimes.  While these issues are linked, the most important issues are jobs and financial stability.  This Bill is one step in bringing that stability back to the economy.The levy will be difficult for everybody to swallow, but it is the least unacceptable form of levy.  There has been resistance to the Bill since it was first proposed but implementing tough decisions is rarely popular or easy to do.  It is the Government's job to make those difficult choices in the best interests of the country and the economy, regardless of polls.  As politicians, we are always cognisant of public opinion but it is important that these decisions are taken without keeping one eye on opinion polls.  It has got to that stage.  We would neglect our jobs as public representatives if we were to pay too much attention to polls at the expense of making tough decisions, albeit the right ones.Ireland is facing hitherto unseen economic challenges on an unprecedented scale.  We have had difficult times in the past but things have never gone from boom to bust at this speed.  It is normal for politicians to try to score political points but it has gone beyond that now.  Some people are calling for an election but that would only paralyse the country at a time when every day is important and our reputation within global financial markets must be restored as a matter of urgency.  An election would only paralyse the political system and do untold damage to domestic financial markets.  The easy option is to call for an election but it would do more harm than good.As with every other TD, my office has been inundated with calls and e-mails about this levy from concerned civil and public servants.  I fully appreciate the challenges the levy places on individuals and families, but it is in everyone's interest that we should deal with this issue responsibly given the problems we face.  We must not skirt around the difficulties and there can be no escaping the facts, regardless of how unpalatable they may be.  We are in the midst of a global recession whose effects are being felt in every developed country.  Ireland operates an open market which, in general, has been positive for us over the past 20 years.  It has, however, left us exposed in the current international downturn.This, coupled with the decline in the construction industry, has meant the economy has deteriorated at a faster rate than anyone could have predicted.  The State will have to borrow €18 billion this year at steeper interest rates to finance current and capital spending.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out, this equates to borrowing €4,500 for every man, woman and child in the State.  The current rate of spending simply cannot continue and savings must be made.The steps the Government is taking is about protecting jobs and assisting small and medium-sized enterprises that generate employment.  They are the risk-takers, create jobs and give stability to society.  Bringing down costs is a matter of urgency.  Costs across the board must come down by at least 30% to 40%, if we are to be able to compete in a globalised economy.  Yes, the pension levy will be difficult for people.  However, it is only the first step and there will be significantly greater pain to come for all sections of society.Some union officials seem to recognise this but others are using out-dated political rhetoric.  They need to grasp an understanding of the difficulties the country is facing.  Some of them are still reading Karl Marx and using his doctrine.  Until now, the private sector has borne the brunt of the economic downturn.  In January, 1,000 people a day lost their jobs in the private sector.  To claim the public sector is being targeted unfairly is not the case.  Workers in the private sector are paying with their jobs.  The decision to implement a pensions-related deduction is not easy but it is deemed the most fair and equitable solution.  Public servants enjoy significantly better pensions than the majority of workers in the private sector.  The benefits are higher and, more importantly, they are secure.It has been claimed the wealthiest in society are not being asked to contribute their share.  In fact, the lowest paid are protected and those on higher incomes contribute most.  Currently, 38% of the entire workforce pays no tax at all.  It should be noted that 6% of the wealthiest in the workforce pay 50% of all our taxes.  Everyone in a position to help must do so.  This levy applies to the salaries of all Deputies and Ministers, who have also taken a 10% pay cut already.  Other measures will have to be introduced.  Those who have more money will have to pay more.  The higher tax band will be increased and I would not be surprised if the increase was to be 8%.If another solution that could deliver the same savings were proposed, it would be considered.  Some union leaders, however, are not interested in solutions but rhetoric.  The Bill's proposals must be implemented for the good of the country.	spk_413

Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-11-25	dail	30	Finance (No. 2) Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed).	dbsect_35	I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak.  If anybody remained unconvinced that we live in a globalised world, they now realise we are part of something bigger than just a country alone.  In many ways we are like a little ship bobbing on very stormy waters.  Unfortunately we are being thrown around because of our dependence and interaction.  We are more exposed than other countries and are probably suffering more than most.  I heard the Minister speak earlier.  It is hard to believe that each day seems to bring worse news and more negativity than the previous one.  Almost all countries are suffering financial difficulties.  The United States economy appears to be frozen.  The President-elect, Mr. Barack Obama, seems to be stepping into the breach by trying to heat up the American economy with cash injections.  I understand the US Treasury Secretary, Mr. Hank Paulson, today decided to inject a further $800 billion into the US economy.  While people might find it galling that such money is being used to bail out Wall Street, as opposed to Main Street, there would be repercussions around the world if such action were not taken.Deputy Cyprian Brady spoke about the notion being peddled by the Opposition that the Celtic years were wasted.  I will give an example of how money was spent for the benefit of this country during that period.  In 1997 there were virtually no special needs assistants in our schools.  In 2008 there are 10,000.  Such assistants support children with special needs.  They ensure the right of such children to an education is vindicated and help them to develop.  That is where the money has been spent in the last ten years.  It is helping disadvantaged people who are less fortunate than Members of this House.The budget introduced comprises a balanced and coherent plan to address the difficulties we are encountering as a consequence of falling revenue.  It has focused attention on the severe challenges and difficulties we face.  It is important to stress that we are not going back to the 1980s which was a completely different time of mass emigration.  We are in a different position.  We are in good shape to take advantage of the tough decisions being made in the budget and future ones.It is unfortunate for the person who becomes unemployed.  However, there are 600,000 more people in employment today than there were ten years ago.  Our export levels have doubled in the past decade.  As Deputy Cyprian Brady said, our living standards have improved dramatically in that time.  We have one of the lowest debt levels in the European Union.  There are over 600,000 more people working now than there were in 1998.  There are 2 million people at work in this country.  We have a low debt-to-GDP ratio.  It has decreased from 53% of GDP in 1998 to 26% this year.  We also have a pension fund and a generous welfare system.  In real terms, the State pension is one of the highest in the European Union.It is easy to criticise young people.  We have an energetic, well trained and well educated young workforce.  By international standards, we have a low tax environment for workers and business.  That has been an important driver of economic growth.  I am glad to say administrative changes will take place within the Health Service Executive and the rest of the public sector.  People are looking for dramatic changes to be made in the broader public sector, as if that would change everything.  In reality, public sector reform will take time.  It will not happen overnight.  It will be done in a constructive and meaningful manner that will see us right in the long term.I wish to comment briefly on the banks.  They appear to be unable to operate in any state other than greed or fear.  We need them to be able to operate in a balanced way.  It is important to stress that they were not bailed out for the sake of the banking industry.  It was done to help ordinary people.  If the banks had not been bailed out, this country would have collapsed, which would have had a desperate effect on families and, in particular, disadvantaged and older people.  It was not done for the bankers — it was done for decent, hard-working and honest people.  I am seriously concerned that the banks are continuing to look after themselves, first and foremost.  They are being supported by the public, through the Government, but do not seem to appreciate that they are still in business as a result of that assistance.  They do not seem to have realised that everything has changed.The public will not accept the astonishing levels of arrogance the banks have shown to date.  The banks appear to believe they are untouchable but they are in for a shock.  They need to realise that they have to start behaving with a degree of humility.  They should recognise that they will not get out of this mess, which they were active participants in bringing about, unless they show balanced judgment and a sense of social responsibility.  If they do not do so, they will suffer just as the rest of us probably will.  Now may not be the time for retribution but there will come a time when heads will have to roll.  It will be expected that heads will roll.  The terms and conditions that apply to any scheme of recapitalisation should ensure this happens to senior bank officials.  The possible recapitalisation of the banks has been bandied about as a silver bullet that will solve everything.  The reality is that recapitalisation, on its own, will not solve all the problems in the banking sector.  If it comes to pass, it must be implemented and supervised carefully.  The terms and conditions of any recapitalisation scheme must be very clear.  They must be skewed in favour of the public purse.  It is clear that supervision of the banks is key.  The banks need to be brought to heel but this has not yet happened.The income levy, one of the key measures in the budget, is aimed at stabilising tax revenues.  It will mean that the better-off will pay more.  The more one earns, the more one will pay.  That is a positive measure.  This is a difficult time and almost everyone will have to bear some pain.  It is likely that those who prospered most in the last ten years will, proportionately, have to endure the most pain.	spk_333
Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-11-20	dail	30	Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_7	I am pleased to get the opportunity to speak on the Bill which is a milestone in terms of how older people are dealt with by the State and will have a significant impact on them.As we get older, our health becomes more important to us and we begin to appreciate what we had.  I notice a group of young people in the Visitors Gallery today.  Many of us look enviously at the health and fitness of those younger than us.  Health is important to everybody, but as one gets older it becomes more important and it is a concern when the body starts to fray and health deteriorates.  This does not always happen gradually, but can occur quickly and can cause deep anxiety.  This happens at a time when the older person's children have grown up and are now setting up their own families and living their own lives, but with their own stresses, concerns and challenges about their children.  Older people may be concerned they see their children less because they are so engaged with their own children.  This increases their anxiety.This Bill will have an impact on this.  The current system is unclear and in many ways unfair.  The measures taken by the Government in the Bill will help to make things fairer.  Fairness is what people want.  As well as deteriorating health, older people often face increased social isolation.  Although we have become more prosperous, notwithstanding the current downturn, people have become more isolated from mainstream society, particularly older people who feel cut off.This is particularly true for older men.  Older men do not seem to engage as much as women with community facilities and activities.  I have noticed when active retirement associations have visited the Houses that they usually contain only approximately two out of 50 who are men and they are inclined to remain quiet.  The women are significantly more active.  The sense of isolation among older people is particularly acute among older men.  This must be addressed.  There are attempts being made to address it, but there is no magic wand.  Older women deal better with ageing than older men and engage with community groups and activities to a larger extent.Growing old is a traumatic and terrifying experience for many, particularly if they have no family or if, for whatever reasons, they find themselves isolated in a community in which they were not brought up.  It is very difficult for these people to re-engage and become involved unless they have a strong personality.  It is difficult to muster the strength needed to become involved at this time of life.Many elderly people do not have families on which they can rely.  Various circumstances have led to them finding themselves isolated without family.  When people have families, the family usually does everything it can to lessen the difficulties of the older person.  However, there often comes a point when there is no option but to say the family can no longer deal with the older person.  I heard of the sad experience of a family, where the mother was experiencing some form of dementia.  The family was concerned about her, but given the family circumstances they were not able to stay with her as much as they would like.  It was when it came to the point of having to lock her into a room one night that they realised the situation was unacceptable and they could not carry on any longer.  In the interest of the mother, whom they loved deeply, they had to give in and decide to let her go into a home.  Such people feel a sense of failure when they have to let their mother or father or relative leave their home and their roots and put them into a nursing home.Most experiences in public nursing homes are positive and families speak highly of the care provided.  The difficulties that have been highlighted have been mainly in private nursing homes.  This Bill will address such difficulties and ensure an equitable standard in these homes.  It will ensure that what has been unclear will be clear.  People will be able to understand and see how the system will work and how they will fit into it.  They will understand how they will be able to care for their parents for the long term.Given our economic difficulties, the simplest thing for the Government would have been to put this legislation on the long finger.  While that could have been done, this Bill demonstrates the commitment of the Government to older people.  The manner in which the issue pertaining to medical cards was communicated and handled was disappointing.  Nonetheless, older people subsequently have told me that over the past 11 years, Fianna Fáil and the Government in many ways have acted as the trade union for older people.  This legislation will reinforce such a view, will demonstrate the Government's commitment to protecting the elderly, who are the most vulnerable people in society, and will clarify matters that were unclear.Furthermore, it will bring about change by allowing people to plan for and predict the future to a degree.  Older people and families with older people who are reaching the age at which they will be obliged to enter nursing homes seek such an opportunity.  They consider it to be comforting to know they can plan and predict what will happen into the future.  It  has been and continues to be unfair that assessments and financial supports vary so markedly across health board areas.  It gives rise to scenarios in which close neighbours, who could be living across the road from each other, each must comply with different assessments, guidelines and payments.  This is difficult to understand for the person who perceives him or herself to have been treated more harshly by a particular health board and is highly frustrating for the families concerned.The pressure to secure adequate nursing home facilities is such that families may have no other option but to sell their family home.  Moreover, this can take place although a child or son still lives there.  The cost of meeting such charges is such that even large or well-off families find it a huge strain on their financial resources to be able to pay for nursing home care.  Consequently, they find themselves being obliged to sell their home.  Deciding that one's parent or loved one must enter a nursing home is one matter.  However, when it is reinforced by being obliged to sell that home, it gives rise a great sense of failure, disappointment and sadness among family members.  This also can vary, depending on the health board area in which one is living.I refer to the doubt and lack of clarity on how one pays for public nursing home places, when one will be obliged to pay for it and who qualifies to get into them.  Given the current economic climate, a great deal of uncertainty exists and this Bill will provide a degree of certainty to families, inasmuch as the State can.  While the State will do whatever it can, ultimate responsibility comes down to families, which must take responsibility for their ageing loved ones and members.As for the proposals, I found a newspaper report to be interesting.  It stated the new proposals offer to take the value of the resident's home at the time of his or her application to enter nursing home care and to link this value to the consumer price index, not the housing market, which has changed.  However, if the house prices should fall, as they clearly are at present, the resident or his or her care representative can apply to have the resident's financial assessment reassessed.  This is a very positive measure.Over the years there has been a blurring of the lines between the public and private sectors, which has had a great impact on the manner in which patients take their places in particular homes.  A major difficulty has arisen in respect of the number of nursing homes and hopefully this Bill will clear the ground to ensure there are more nursing homes, particularly in the Dublin area.  Recent reports have demonstrated that the number of nursing homes in south Dublin does not meet the demand.  In effect, people living in south Dublin are obliged to travel significant distances to access public or private nursing homes.  This gives rise to considerable inconvenience.  For example, when one lives in the inner city or in Terenure, Rathgar or Rathmines and one's loved one, be it a mother, father, aunt or grandmother, is in a home in counties Wicklow or Kildare, visits will entail considerable journeys.  Moreover, such distance will give rise to a sense of isolation and unhappiness with the service provided, irrespective of the micro-delivery of the service in the nursing home in question.It is traumatic for families who are obliged to travel down the country to visit relatives.  The family member may be notified of the visit but will then have to wait if there are delays, or even if the visit has to be cancelled due to traffic or other factors.  The consequent sense of disappointment felt by person affected is hard for the family to take.More nursing homes are required in the south Dublin area.  While its population is both ageing and changing, a significant number of older people live there.  I recently visited a service provider for older people in Rathmines, which two or three years ago used to cater for approximately 20 clients in the form of older people who visited for lunch, dinner and daytime activities.  That number has more than doubled.  While the general population is ageing, south Dublin is ageing significantly.The infrastructure for older people is insufficient and this Bill will bring clarity, consistency and reassurance to them.  It will allow people to plan and to predict what will happen.  Moreover, it will enable them to plan their finances, which must be a good thing.  The measure is designed to make the service provision for older people in nursing homes much more sustainable.  The State will continue to meet almost 70% of the total cost of long-term care for the population. I welcome the Government's introduction of this measure during a difficult economic downturn.  A recent NESC report on the developmental welfare state claimed the Bill will be tailored universalism.  In the past few months, universal payments and their long-term impact during downturns have been debated.  The Bill will not leave other people picking up the tab.  Rather, recipients will pay for services on delivery.  They will not be thrown out of their homes onto the streets, which would be traumatic, and they will get better care in public——	spk_259

Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-11-19	dail	30	Gas (Amendment) Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_9	I welcome the opportunity to speak.  The purpose of the Bill is to increase the statutory borrowing limit of Bord Gáis from €1.7 billion to €3 billion.  I wholeheartedly support its speedy passage through the Dáil.  Bord Gáis Éireann has clearly performed very strongly in 2007 and revenues were up 10% on 2006 figures to €1.2 billion.  Connections to the gas network have grown from 402,000 in 2002 to more than 570,000 today.  As a previous speaker mentioned, there may be difficult times in the economy in general but there are great opportunities and challenges within the energy sector.The increase in the borrowing limit is required in order that Bord Gáis can continue to fund its capital expenditure programme over the next five years.  This capital expenditure includes, among other issues, the expansion of its core gas business and its development as a company.  It is important that Bord Gáis is able to engage in expansion.  In recent months we have been reminded of just how important it is for us to have security of energy supply.  Ireland is a small energy market on the edge of Europe, with a very limited indigenous supply of energy - a position this Government is committed to changing.  It will not happen overnight.Over 70% of our energy is imported and we depend on external sources.  It is imperative that we protect our own resources in a sustainable way.  Russian troops still remain in Georgia after the conflict there, which reminds us geopolitics could potentially endanger continued supply.  During the week we have seen the hijacking of an oil tanker by Somali pirates, which had an immediate impact on the price of oil.  The commodity's value is balanced very delicately and it does not take much to disrupt it.  To ensure we have a proper, well-managed and proactive system in dealing with energy is very important.It is said one only misses things when they are gone.  On a recent visit to the Gaza Strip it was evident Israelis had restrictions on fuel and power coming through to the ordinary families and people working there.  One could see how important energy is and how a restriction on the flow of energy can have an effect.  When we visited there were power cuts, which caused chaos for the people relying on fuel, energy and power.  We visited a hospital and could see first hand an impact where babies were in incubators.  When there were power cuts the incubators could not be heated, which had a detrimental effect on the children.No more than in Gaza, if we have difficulty with our power supply for some reason, it would have significant impact on ordinary people's lives.  It is very important that we protect the supply.Bord Gáis has performed strongly over the years.  Environmental sustainability is a cornerstone of the Government's energy policy framework and I strongly advocate continued investment in renewable and alternative energy supply.  Development of renewables will enable us to meet our greenhouse emission targets, as well as improving energy security, which as I have said is very important.  Bord Gáis has a commitment to investment in this area, which I welcome.  I commend the Bill to the House and urge other Members to do so also.	spk_195
Chris Andrews	33	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-11-12	dail	30	Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_11	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  Reading the Bill, one would be forgiven for being unaware of the extreme difficulties faced by the economy.  When one takes into account that more than 75% of funds in the recent budget went on health, education and welfare, one can see that the Government is committed to showing fairness and equity to vulnerable sections of communities throughout society.We find ourselves in changed economic circumstances compared to this time 12 months ago.  There is no doubt that tough decisions will have to be made.  As the Taoiseach recently announced, it is estimated that in 2009, 10% of the public sector bill will be paid for through borrowing.  This will have a significant effect on public finances and we must take this into consideration, as the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, has just outlined.  I am pleased the Bill ensures that continued payments will be made to those who are most in need and that it targets resources at the most disadvantaged.  Targeting disadvantaged sections of society is more important now than it has ever been.  Looking at the budget, one can see the Government is committed to doing this.While there has been some alleviation of pressure due to reductions in interest rates and the decreases in the price of oil, these have not always been passed on to customers straight away.  I have advocated and will continue to advocate the passing on of these benefits to customers immediately.  The banks, particularly in recent times, have shown a great reluctance to pass on interest rate cuts to the consumer, and this must be highlighted.  Given that measures have been put in place to support the banks, they now need to step up to the plate and support the hard-pressed consumer.  However, it is important to remember that these reductions in cost, while alleviating inflationary pressures, do not always confer a direct benefit on those most in need.  I therefore take this opportunity to welcome the announcement made two weeks ago by the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, that an extra payment would be made to social welfare recipients at Christmas.This Bill provides for more than €515 million in increased support for pensioners, families and job-seekers.  Spending on social welfare will grow by almost €2.6 billion to more than €19.5 billion in 2009.  Given the economic climate, this is an ambitious target.As I will not have time to examine every aspect of the Bill I will focus on three main areas: its effects on older people, families and job-seekers.  From the start of January 2009, there will be an increase of €7 per week in the maximum personal rates of payment for contributory and transition State pensions.  This will bring the new weekly rate to €230.  The State non-contributory pension is also being increased by €7 per week, bringing the new rate to €219 per week from January 2009.  This will be of direct benefit to more than 440,000 pensioners.The fuel allowance is important, as people across the country recognise that fuel for older people is a key issue.  I am pleased that the fuel allowance is increasing by €2 per week to €20 per week from January 2009, an increase of 11%.  In addition, the number of weeks covered by the allowance is to be extended by two to 32 weeks from April next year.  Critics may argue this is not enough, but it is a move in the right direction.  Not everything happens as quickly as we would like, but given the economic climate it is a very positive move in the right direction.  I hope fuel costs will continue to decrease.  The cost of this scheme is €30 million in 2009 and will affect nearly 300,000 households.  That has a significant impact on families across the country.  When loneliness and social exclusion are constant threats we must ensure the vulnerable and older people are not left behind, and this budget ensures that.Budget 2009 will provide increases for families with children in receipt of social welfare payments.  Social welfare dependent parents receive an extra €24 per week for each child on top of their basic social welfare payments through the qualified child increase.  From January 2009 this will be increased by €2 to €26 per child.  The family income supplement, FIS, paid to low-income working families will be increased by €10 per week in respect of each child, giving an average extra payment of €6 per child per week.  It is estimated that 29,000 families will benefit from FIS in 2009.  Approximately 2,000 additional families are likely to become eligible for a FIS payment.  It is vital those families most in need are targeted with increased payments.  Budget 2009 sees reforms to the child benefit system whereby the payment of child benefit to over 18 year olds will be phased out between now and 2010.  This is designed to ensure the most vulnerable and those too young to work will continue to receive payments.  The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill contains provisions to extend the number of people eligible to claim back to school clothing and footwear allowances, which I welcome.The jobseeker's allowance will be a particularly contentious issue over the coming years and the number of people signing on to the live register has increased to over 260,000 earlier this month, which is the highest figure in over ten years.  Jobs are being created every week in Ireland.  Unfortunately we do not always hear about it.  Some commentators are reluctant to mention it in case it gets in the way of the doom and gloom story some like to peddle.  Government policy is committed to continuing to attract investment and promote indigenous industries.  We had a presentation from Guaranteed Irish and it is a very cost effective scheme.  It is important that consumers and retailers highlight the need to buy Irish.I welcome the increase in social welfare expenditure of €2.6 million next year.  I also welcome the targeting of resources towards the most vulnerable in society.  We need to be prepared and realistic when planning in the future.  We must ensure the Exchequer is looked after responsibly and that future welfare support payments are there when we need them.  This Bill gets the balance right and I commend it to the House.	spk_399

Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-10-21	dail	30	Financial Resolution No. 15: (General) Resumed. 	dbsect_22	I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this budget.  I believe it is the first of a number of difficult budgets because clearly matters will not improve over night.  The situation in the globalised world in which we live today, as in Ireland, is pretty severe.  Despite the difficult economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, Ireland today is in a much better place than it was ten or 15 years ago.  Currently, we have 2 million people in work.  This is not to lessen the impact of people losing their jobs, which is clearly a traumatic experience, or the fact that more people will leave Ireland to find work abroad.  However, the need to leave Ireland does not carry with it nowadays the same fear experienced in the 1980s that if one left, one might not get back for many years.  The changing world and airline industry makes it possible for one to feel not very far away from home.  While people may have to move to another country for work, they will not leave with the same level of sadness with which people left in the past.There has been a real improvement in living standards in Ireland and we now have a much more generous welfare system.  The Government introduced the biggest public investment programme in the history of the State.  All these advances were made in the context of good public finances and impressive and record levels of economic growth.  However, we are in exceptional times and must make difficult choices.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has made difficult choices.  I believe he has a steady nerve and a steady hand and showed his coolness under pressure two weeks ago.  The situation with the banks showed the Minister to be a man apart from the crowd.  He was impressive and is continuing in that vein.The global economy is going through a severe storm.  I recently heard President Bush say on radio that things are getting better.  I am not sure I share his optimism, but who knows?  Perhaps he will get one thing right during his tenure as President.  In this severe economic storm, Ireland is but a small boat bobbing on the economic seas and has been left open to the harsh winds of the downturn.  We must make the right decisions now.  While they may not gain us short-term popularity, people will in time recognise they were the right choices.  Time will prove that this budget was what was needed to steady the Irish ship in these stormy times.  It will be the first of many budgets devised to get us back on course and to take advantage of the upturn in the global economy when it inevitably comes.Two weeks ago, the Minister for Finance introduced measures to deal with the threat to the banking system and the knock-on effects on the economy.  There has been much talk of the Government bailing out the banks.  The Government did not assist the banks for the banks' sake.  It did so to ensure that the economy did not collapse around us and that families and communities throughout the country were not plunged into the economic abyss that faced us.  Many people, excluding the Labour Party who did not support the Minister, believe he handled the matter with great confidence and determination.The banking system in Ireland differs from the banking system in the US and other models used throughout Europe.  Each banking system has grown up with its own differences.  There has been much criticism of the regulatory system in Ireland which is made up of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance.  Despite what people say, the banks, who are players in this, do not want the banking system to go under.  They have as much interest in the banking sector surviving this crisis and in co-operating with the Minister for Finance through the new bank guarantee scheme.  Our regulatory framework is among the best in Europe, if not the world.Last April, I was part of a group that visited New York and Washington to meet with different groups from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and some of the banks.  It was clear that there was no one in the US who had a vested interest in calling a halt to what was happening.  From homeowners and brokers who thought they would make a killing right up to Wall Street, everybody felt this could not go wrong.  Clearly, nobody was there who wanted to or was able to call a halt.That is not the case in Ireland.  We have difficulties but in America, national confidence in the banking system collapsed.  This spread like a virus through the Irish banking system and we now have a real problem.  It was not caused by any gross negligence in the banking system but by the lack of confidence in the American banking system.  I understand sub-prime lending in Ireland accounts for less than 3% of the residential market whereas in the US it accounts for over 25%.  Clearly, our market and banking system bear little resemblance to that of America.There is no doubt this year's budget has been one of the trickiest in many years as we are not in as healthy a financial position as we enjoyed over the past ten years.  We are not alone in this position as countries across the world are experiencing downturns and face tough decisions.  When one considers what has happened in Iceland, one can be thankful we have a Minister for Finance and a Taoiseach who could act with such decisiveness and determination.  Although their actions were criticised by Germany and England — the British Government expressed concern — those governments realised the Irish model was to be followed.The overall aim of the budget is to rebalance the public finances.  This will not be done in one or two budgets and may not even be done in three.  We must do it and savings sought by the Government must be found.  They will be sought through indirect taxes, such as the rise in cigarette and fuel taxation — there was some discussion as to whether the tax on cigarettes should have been increased by more for health reasons.  In considering health issues, one must take the broad view that, on balance, the increase achieved by Government is fair.  The same applies to the rise in the cost of petrol.The €200 levy on non-principal residences is innovative.  I represent Dublin South-East and a large section of the constituency has second homes or non-principal residences.  All these people have said that although they would prefer not to pay it, the levy is there and they are not that upset about it.  They recognise that paying a small levy is not a significant inconvenience.I am satisfied this budget is pro-business and aims to encourage new commerce and research, which is vital to keeping the economy healthy in the long run.  Measures include an increase in the research and development tax credit from 20% to 25% and the remission in capital gains tax for new companies in their first three years.  The filing of tax returns is always a big concern for businesses and the Government proposes to encourage take-up of the Revenue Commissioner's on-line service by providing a general extension to existing deadlines where returns and payments are made via the on-line system.  This is a good initiative which is about encouraging people rather than penalising where possible.It is very important that corporation tax is kept low and achieving this aim has been prioritised.  Even US presidential hopeful John McCain is now talking about this in his speeches.We are all aware of the recent controversy about medical cards but it is important to focus on the fair deal initiative, for which the budget has provided €55 million.  The deal will make arrangements for financial support for people who need long-term care, which is vital to ensuring stability and security for people in old age.  In the past few days we have seen that security and being able to plan for the future is a very important requirement for older people in the community.I welcome the increase in mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers.  The decline in house prices has offered some opportunity for those seeking to get on the property ladder but it is nevertheless daunting for those trying to purchase a home.  I spoke to a group of young people in employment today who said it was a good budget for them because prices are coming down and mortgage interest relief is going up.  It has been increased from 20% to 25% in the first two years of a mortgage and to 22.5% in the third to fifth years.  The rate has reduced from 20% to 15% for non-first-time buyers.  It is a good initiative.Although we speak of the rising unemployment rate, we must remember that over 90% of the workforce is still in employment.  Such people see house prices coming down and are closer to the opportunity to buy a home, which is good.  Every cloud has a silver lining and such people see it.There has also been a significant increase in investment in social and affordable housing, which I fully support.  This is being done largely through the extension of the local authority mortgage scheme and the introduction of the Government equity scheme.There is no doubt people will have to make sacrifices.  I welcome the 10% cut in Ministers' salaries, although I am not sure Ministers would welcome it.  It sends a signal.  None of us wants to pay tax — if we had a choice we would not pay any — unless one is from an ideological party which believes so much tax should be paid that nothing would ever work.  To refer back to America, I heard US presidential hopeful Barack Obama say he would prefer to pay no tax.  Although nobody wants to pay tax, we recognise we must do so to get the balance right.  The Government has done this and its approach has been to make tough decisions now so we can ride out the economic downturn and be in a good position to avail of the upturn when it arrives.  There is no doubt we are in a better position to do this than we were ten, 15 or 20 years ago.I will briefly refer to the medical card.  Today's announcement and the accompanying figures will put older people's minds at ease.  A significant aspect for older people is having a bit of security and being able to plan for the future, as I mentioned.  The issues surrounding the medical card have shown that people were very upset by these events and I am genuinely sad at the upset and concern which older people felt on the withdrawal of the card.  Many people were unclear as to whether their medical card was to be withdrawn, although in many cases it would not.Those who would have been affected by the original proposal were clearly upset and everybody knows people of advanced years.  I welcome today's announcement.  The Minister has shown he is willing to listen and to bring about changes when the case is strong.  Older people had a strong case, which they made, and the Government will get on with managing the country.  In many ways, the Government has acted as a union for older people and Members must ensure they continue to protect older people.	spk_479

Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-10-08	dail	30	Broadcasting Bill 2008 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_26	"I do not have any quotes to match those so I will stick to the basics.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which had over 420 submissions during the consultation process.  Notwithstanding the comments of Deputy Higgins, it is a positive Bill which will clearly change the shape of broadcasting in Ireland.Some of the main points may not address the concerns of Deputy Higgins but they make a positive contribution to broadcasting.  The new and overarching broadcasting authority of Ireland will address much of the concern that viewers and citizens have with public and private broadcasters.  The introduction of sanctions of up to €250,000 for licence and code infringements is a positive move.  Previously, the BCI had to take what was the drastic option of revoking a licence for a code or licence infringement.  That the punishment will be staggered and the penalty will suit the crime is probably a good step.The establishment of audience councils is a positive move.  Two new stations will be set up, Oireachtas TV and the Irish film channel.  I will come back to the Oireachtas TV channel in a moment.I have a number of observations to make on the ban on the advertising of junk food aimed at children.  With recent figures indicating that almost 300,000 Irish children are affected by obesity, it is clear that addressing the problem will be a major challenge for society, especially parents.I read in one of the submissions on the legislation that while carbohydrate intake has not increased in the past ten years, exercise levels have declined significantly.  If people eat more and exercise less, it will clearly have a knock-on effect in terms of the rate of obesity.  As a parent and someone who is involved with local sporting groups, I believe addressing the problem of obesity is best done through parental and school involvement rather than in the media.  When children are active and involved in local activities it has a positive impact on reducing obesity.The ongoing development of sports facilities must be maintained.  The Ceann Comhairle in a previous life did much to address the shortage of sporting facilities.  This has made a major difference in all sections of the community, whether elite athletes or those who wish only to participate in sport.  One problem we face is to persuade parents to stay and become involved in clubs and activities rather than dropping off their children or using sports facilities as crèches.The decision to introduce a ban on junk food advertisements aimed at children is a positive step but no more than a tiny piece in the jigsaw in terms of our efforts to tackle obesity.  Deputy Coveney lamented the fact that a restriction similar to the ban on junk food advertising does not apply to alcohol advertisements.  I agree that this is a missed opportunity and I hope the proposed broadcasting authority of Ireland will have the power to introduce strong measures to restrict the advertising of alcohol on television.  I hope the Minister will examine this issue and, if necessary, beef up the authority's powers in this area.  In saying this, I do not seek to detract from the positive measures in the legislation.The Ceann Comhairle has led the way in making the Houses of the Oireachtas more accessible to members of the public. While I have no doubt that an Oireachtas television challenge makes sense in theory and will, in time, become necessary, I am not convinced that such a channel is currently required.  Knowing that this legislation was pending, over the past week I asked a number of people whether they had ever followed contributions in the House live on the Oireachtas website.  Not one of those whom I asked had visited the website to watch the live feed of proceedings and many of them were not aware that it was possible to do so.  For this reason, it may be preferable to raise public awareness of available services before we seek to establish an Oireachtas television channel.  Our current media infrastructure, specifically the RTE, TG4 and TV3 television channels, are the appropriate vehicle for improving the connection between the Oireachtas and members of the public.  At this point, the establishment of a new channel would amount to a duplication of services.  Perhaps someone will provide a technical reason showing that a new channel would not generate additional costs.People are not ready for an Oireachtas television channel.  ""Oireachtas Report"" is a top-class, professional programme."	spk_435
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-10-08	dail	30	Broadcasting Bill 2008 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_26	"I hope it will have a large audience.Although ""Oireachtas Report"" is a high quality production, it is shown at such a late hour that only insomniacs and political anoraks watch it.  People are sometimes right to accuse Members of living in a bubble, especially if we believe many people watch ""Oireachtas Report"".  The programme should be moved to a slot earlier in the evening or presented as an item in the afternoon schedule.Many people would be interested in watching ""Oireachtas Report"".  For this reason, its remit should be extended to include regular rather than occasional coverage of proceedings in the European Parliament.  Deputy Coveney will understand better than most of us that drawing attention to European issues is a difficult task, particularly in the wake of the difficulties we experienced with coverage of the Lisbon treaty campaign.  It is important that proceedings in the European Parliament are given greater coverage.  Given that news programmes feature country round-ups, why is it not possible to broadcast a summary of proceedings in the Oireachtas or European Parliament each evening?We have not used up all available resources to maximise the connection between the Houses and members of the public.  As the resounding success of recent open days showed, many people have a keen interest in the work of the House.  Public interest will not increase overnight but over time and in incremental steps.  The Oireachtas channel is a step too far at this point.  It would be akin to fitting an ashtray to a motorbike in that it would look great but would not be practical.On the establishment of an Irish film channel, I am not a great fan of television.  As a radio person who does not watch much television, I may be biased.  Nevertheless, the Bill will make a difference in this regard and it is good to examine all the options available to us.I share other speakers' concern about the ban on advertisements for religious vocations.  A large number of people find comfort and solace in religion.  During the summer I was fortunate to be able to travel to Gambia in western Africa with Voluntary Service Overseas where I met a Holy Ghost Father from Blackrock, Bishop Bobby Ellison.  He has spent more than 40 years there, quietly, gently and efficiently getting on with making a difference in people's lives.  Gambia and other countries in Africa have gone through a great deal of turmoil but through all that the Holy Ghost Fathers and Bishop Ellison, in his work, have made a positive difference.  Bishop Ellison's work has been a cornerstone on which improvements have been made within Gambian society. He has made an incredible contribution to that society.  It is amazing that an order such as the Holy Ghost Fathers cannot advertise on television for religious vocations.  The members of the order get on with their work.  They are quiet, non-intrusive and constructive in the work that they do in Africa and elsewhere across the globe, work of which we should be proud.However, when it comes to Ireland, people here consider we have become a modern society and television advertisements for religious vocations are old-fashioned.  Deputy Higgins made the comment that perhaps he is part of that old valued world.  The banning of advertisements for religious vocations is a backward and retrograde step and such advertising should be permitted in the context of this Bill.The Minister has a chance to break the cosy cartel that appears to operate in broadcasting media.  I  very much welcome his decision, for the first time in the history of the State, to facilitate an Oireachtas committee, the Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, to nominate four members to the board of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and four members each  to the boards of RTE and TG4.  That is a positive move because it provides a link between the work of this House and the committee with the broadcasting sector.  Many people may criticise the committees and say that they do not do this or that, but this is a visionary move by the Minister to empower a committee with a degree of influence and a central role in the decision-making process.  His decision to allow the committees appoint such members is positive.I ask that he takes the lead in such board appointments and in the appointment of members to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  I would like him to set an example by appointing not the usual suspects but people who will challenge us.  I do not mean that they would agree with everything we say but that they would challenge us in a positive way and stimulate debate within the broadcasting sector.  There is, in many ways, a lack of debate within the sector.  By appointing people who would be challenging, that would have an impact on the ongoing development of this process, namely, the change the Minister is seeing through.I would like the Minister to appoint ordinary people from around the country.  We all know and meet people through our day to day work who would make ideal members of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, but  we know that they would never be appointed to it.  However, I would like people who work within the community or are involved in community groups or industry and know people's views on various issues to be considered in this respect.  Referring to the Lisbon treaty, many people within the broadcasting sector were detached from the views of ordinary people.  That was reflected in the coverage of that debate and the way issues were handled, but I acknowledge other issues affected the type of coverage it received.However, there is a group in society who are detached from the views of the vast large majority of people on various issues.  That group lives in a bubble and, therefore, it is important that members who will challenge issues are appointed to these boards.  I refer to people such as Senator Ronan Mullen and David Quinn, with whom I disagree on many issues.  They would challenge views and create good debate, and that is what we need.  We need people who will challenge us, the establishment and cosy cartel in society.  There is a segment in society who look down on our traditional values and on people who hold values that are not considered cool, trendy and modern.  We need to not look down on them but to engage and debate with them.I hope the Minister will set an example in his selection of members and ensure that this Bill will work as well in practice as it does in theory.  In theory, this is a good Bill and it will make a big difference to the broadcasting sector and to society, but it must also work in practice.  I hope the Minister, in his appointments, will make this Bill work in practice."	spk_437
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-09-25	dail	30	Irish Economy: Motion (Resumed). 	dbsect_6	I thank Deputy Calleary for sharing time with me.  I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.It is important to state at the outset that Ireland is part of a globalised economy.  Everybody, including the dogs in the streets, know this.  Our position in that world is affected by what happens in the United States of America.  The only people who do not appear to be aware Ireland is part of a global economy are Members of the Fine Gael Party.  The motion before the House makes no mention of the fact that Ireland is part of a globalised economy.Clearly, Fine Gael is trying to blinker the public into believing that we in Ireland will be only affected by events in Ireland; that we alone can deal with them and that the meltdown in the US financial markets will have no impact on Ireland.  This is not the case.  There is an acceptance that savings must be made.  There is also an acceptance that we cannot return to the situation that prevailed in the 1980s.  Deputy Calleary stated that we are in a much better position now than we were in the 1980s and prior to that.  We now have more than 2 million people in work, a substantial pension fund and our best asset is our educated young workforce.The financial markets of any country depend on confidence in the system.  That lack of confidence did not originate in Ireland rather, it originated in the US.  Despite what Deputy Michael D. Higgins said, it has spread like a virus.  The financial markets are so delicately balanced that confidence has a significant impact on them.	spk_208
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-09-25	dail	30	Irish Economy: Motion (Resumed). 	dbsect_6	"A lack of confidence in the US market has undermined confidence in Ireland and the wider economy.  One has to look no further than the situation that arose with Northern Rock, which was well capitalised, to see the real impact of a lack of confidence in the market.  Customers lost confidence in that bank and the rest is history.Some commentators and members of the Opposition speak about the economy and the financial markets in negative terms.  No one is suggesting there are not serious challenges ahead for the banks or the economy.  Everybody recognises this is the case.  It is the reason the budget has been brought forward to 14 October and I welcome that.The use of words such as ""we are facing a meltdown"" and commentators suggesting they are being muzzled is, in my opinion, completely irresponsible.  I do not believe this is in anyone's interest except perhaps those making the claims.  The banking model used in Ireland is different from that used in the US.Earlier this year members of the finance committee met with various stakeholders in New York and Washington and noted a clear absence of regulatory structures in the financial markets there.  What happened in America was that, from the hopeful homeowner to the brokers and right up to Wall Street, there was no one there to shout stop.  It was in nobody's interest to do so.  This is the outcome.  While we were on our visit to America, Henry Paulson announced that he intended to introduce plans for regulation, but it was said that it would not happen until after the November election.  Clearly, self-regulation does not work.  Even the Republicans appear, reluctantly, to be accepting that now.In Ireland, the model is very different.  We have a much more robust regulatory framework overseeing the financial markets.  We have the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, the chairman of which appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service earlier this year."	spk_210
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-09-25	dail	30	Irish Economy: Motion (Resumed). 	dbsect_6	"We also have the ECB, and the Department of Finance oversees matters.  Clearly, the Irish model is significantly different from the American model.  I read recently that 24% of mortgages in the US are sub-prime in nature, while in Ireland it is less than 3%.  Ireland's difficulties are not the same as those of the US, but the lack of confidence has had a major impact on us.  Years ago it used to be said that when Britain sneezed, Ireland got a cold.  Now, the US has pneumonia and Ireland will have to take its medicine.  People expect us to take that medicine.The OECD, in an economic survey earlier this year, stated that Irish banks were well capitalised and that their past large profits had given them a buffer to get them through the current difficulties.  That is the reality, despite what people like to say.  If there is any more volatility in the financial markets, it is unlikely some commentators will make it to Christmas without having a nervous breakdown.  The partnership deal reached a number of weeks ago was the result of much negotiation and compromise.  It is easy to say that one side did not go far enough or that the Government should have imposed X, Y or Z.  However, those who say that forget that it is about partnership and agreement.  It is a good compromise and I believe it will be one of the cornerstones on which the new and stronger economy will be built.The Opposition appears to want to have it every way.  As Deputy Calleary said, they use nice generalisations such as ""hunting down waste"".  We all know the devil is in the detail.  It would be nice to hear them spell out which Ministers of State they feel are not needed any more.  Do they believe we should get rid of the Minister of State with responsibility for integration, or the Minister of State with responsibility for older people?  Are older people now somehow expendable in the Fine Gael ideology?  At a time when we need to maintain a cool head and steady nerves, I am delighted that we have a Minister for Finance who has the calmness, foresight and vision to get the economy into shape so that when the global economic upturn comes we will be in a position to benefit.  I support the amendment."	spk_212
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-07-01	dail	30	Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_26	I thank Deputy Cuffe for sharing time.  I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.When discussing issues such as drugs and alcohol, one always feels one is showing signs of one's age and that one sounds like one's grandmother.  However, I am not going to pass up the opportunity to sound like my grandmother or the Minister of State's for that matter.Clearly, alcohol is a gateway drug which, for young people, opens up the way to an entirely new culture.  People are increasingly drinking at a young age.  The difficulties we face are clear, particularly when one analyses some of the statistics.  The statistics to which I refer indicate that 28% of all attendances at accident and emergency departments in acute hospitals in respect of injuries are alcohol-related, that alcohol was a contributory factor in 36% of all fatal crashes, that it was also a factor in 25% of severe domestic abuse cases and that 46% of those who had committed homicide were intoxicated.We must, as a society, address the problems to which the consumption of alcohol gives rise.  Politicians or political institutions will not be able to deal with this matter on their own.  Action must be taken in consultation with parents and the Government.  Everyone has a role to play.  Gordon Holmes and the alcohol advisory group have done excellent work in crystallising the difficulties and challenges we face.While it is clear that the Bill will not solve all our difficulties, it represents another step towards tackling many of the issues to which I refer.  Deputy Cuffe referred to the problem of binge drinking.  Such drinking is a very visible problem among young people.  The introduction of alcopops such as fat frogs and others has, in the case of young people, made drinking trendy.  When I was young, I did not drink.  However, my friends used to hide the fact that they were drinking.  They used to go to the bottom of the local field where they could not be seen or heard, except on occasion.  It is almost a badge of honour now for young people to be seen walking around with bags or trays of cans of alcohol.  I am concerned that it is almost trendy to be seen weighed down with alcohol on one's way to the local field, someone's house or wherever it is that young people drink these days.During the period 1999 to 2005 the number of juvenile offences almost trebled.  That is a matter of concern.  I have two young children who, thankfully, have not yet reached drinking age.  However, it is worrying for parents to face the eventuality of their children going off to hang out with their friends.  One must give one's children a certain degree of independence but one must also know their whereabouts and have some control over them, which is becoming increasingly difficult.  In certain areas of my constituency children gather each Friday evening to drink outside the shops.  This is a cause of grave concern for people who live in those areas and the Garda, which is not in a position to solve the problem.  This Bill will certainly make it easier to address difficulties as they arise on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday evening.  Gardaí will now have the power to seize alcohol.  The problem does not only arise in respect of young people because my age group does not set a good example for our children.  In Temple Bar, adults are rolling out of pubs incoherent and unstable.  That happens all over the city.The Government needs to support cultural change through legislation, as it did in the past when drink driving was not regarded as a serious offence.  The practice is now frowned upon thanks to a mixture of legislation and education.  This Bill will support those who are trying to address alcohol abuse in Ireland.Supermarkets are a serious problem in terms of below cost selling.  The Competition Authority would say that below cost selling cannot be prohibited for competition reasons but when it has such a social impact we, as legislators, must override the authority's rigid adherence to the free market.  Some form of regulation is needed.  Petrol stations appear to be a problem in terms of easy access to alcohol.  I would prefer that petrol stations sell nothing but petrol, although I appreciate the severe problems this would cause in rural areas.  I am speaking from a Dublin perspective and acknowledge that many rural petrol stations have morphed into community shops and have become the centres of village life in many places.  Simply banning petrol stations from selling beer would not suffice but it might be considered within city limits.  In the city centre and the suburbs, the sale of alcohol in garages is clearly a problem.I welcome the Minister's proposed changes in respect of early houses.  While they may not be the place to drink fine wines, early houses play an important part in Dublin's inner city and working class communities.  Many of them are frequented by taxi drivers and shift workers.This Bill is a good step forward and I have no hesitation in supporting it.	spk_505

In many ways, I am very disappointed with the result.  When a person puts a big effort into an event, he or she hopes that it will go in the desired way but, unfortunately, on this occasion that did not happen.  My constituency colleagues, Deputies Ruairí Quinn and Lucinda Creighton, also put a huge effort into the campaign.  I met them regularly on the ground, in and out of shopping centres and canvassing door to door.  The last time I met Deputy Quinn was at canal bridges.There was a multiplicity of reasons and issues which resulted in people voting ""No"". There is no simple answer and we can look at it in many ways till the cows come home.  I picked up on a couple of main issues.  One is that the treaty is a complex legal document made between 27 nations and it was extremely difficult to simplify.  There were other issues completely unrelated to the European Union.  In the country, people were concerned about not being able to cut their turf.  Fishermen had difficulties too and farmers did serious injury to the ""Yes"" vote although they came out to support it in the last——"	spk_275

They came in on the last day but at that stage the sense among farming families appeared to be one of opposition and, unfortunately, the IFA could not turn back the tide as quickly as they had wished or had imagined they could.One of the most significant issues I picked up on was immigration.  It is a serious issue that comes up repeatedly.  Somebody made the point earlier that immigration was ""lurking"".  I do not believe it is lurking, rather that it is very much on its hind legs and about to cause severe problems unless we deal with it.  Clearly, there is a disconnect between the European Union, the European project and the vast swathe of the inner city working class community.  I noticed that most of the press releases for the  ""Yes"" side were made out for I imagine that most readers of There is an attitude of intolerance towards people who voted ""No"".  We cannot dismiss them and we must address their fears.  I do not believe for one moment that the Irish are racist.  In Ringsend, a deacon will shortly be ordained who is welcomed with open arms in that area and is much loved by residents there.  I do not believe for one minute that the Irish are racist, but we must speed up the appeals process.  When people have no further recourse to the law, we must deport them quickly.  Multiculturalism is not the way forward and strict integration is the best option.  When one considers the examples of France and England, one will realise diversity has brought considerable problems.  Ireland must address this matter.  The European Union has received a wake-up call and if it does not heed it, we will be in serious trouble."	spk_278
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-06-04	dail	30	Lisbon Reform Treaty Report: Statements. 	dbsect_28	"I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  I pay tribute to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, Deputy Perry.  As a member of the committee, I have seen him close up and know that he runs a professional, enthusiastic and efficient committee, on which I compliment him.A recent Eurobarometer opinion poll showed that a large majority supported our EU membership but the difficulty was only one quarter believed their opinions counted when the European Union made decisions.  The challenge facing us as public representatives is to not only widen the areas covered by the European Union's structures but to strengthen those structures.  We have a responsibility to build a bridge between what is considered a distant European Union and the day-to-day lives of the citizens we meet and represent during our working week.  The way to build this bridge is to make the European Union more efficient and relevant.  This can be done through committees such as the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny and by giving more power to the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Seanad and the Dáil.The only way to give more power to the Oireachtas is to vote ""Yes"" to the Lisbon treaty.  The treaty will make a difference by enhancing the role of the Seanad and the Dáil in a way separate from the role of the Government.  I find it difficult to understand how the likes of Deputy Finian McGrath and Senator Norris who have long been advocates of reform of the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas can advocate a ""No"" vote having seen this opportunity to enhance the role of the Houses.  I am sure that after the referendum on the treaty, we will hear them speak eloquently about the need to enhance the role of the Seanad and the Dáil, yet they are not taking this opportunity and are advocating a rejection of the benefits of the treaty.The Lisbon treaty will ensure compliance with the principle of subsidiarity.  In layman's terms, this means that the Dáil and the Seanad will have key roles in the decision-making process.  New measures that will be introduced should the treaty be passed will mean this Parliament will receive documents directly from the Commission, giving it more time to react to proposals and an opportunity to involve itself in the legislative process at the earliest stage.  Our MEPs will have increased involvement due to the increased power of co-decision in up to 40 new policy areas.  The European Parliament will have the right to elect the President of the Commission; currently it only has the power of assent.There are measures that we in the Houses of the Oireachtas can take to build on the positive aspects of the Lisbon treaty, should it be passed.  There must be reforms.  Deputy Perry, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, proposed that one day a month should be given over to consideration of European business.  I acknowledge that this is only a start and that MEPs should be allowed to contribute in the Dáil Chamber on specific issues relating to the European Union.  This would help strengthen the connection between the Union and the citizens we represent.Ireland is at a crossroads in terms of its relationship with the European Union.  We have contributed a great deal and made a huge positive input in developing the Union.  In the past 35 years Ireland has also benefitted hugely from its involvement in the Union.  For this reason, I am disappointed that the ""No"" side is running what I deem to be a self-interested, isolationist campaign.  This campaign does no one justice, as Ireland has been a shining light for the rest of the Union and further afield.  When one considers all we have received from it, it is amazing to think some wish to pull up the drawbridge on other countries which are in the same position we were in 35 years ago.  It is disappointing that people pretend to care about the European Union when, in fact, they only wish to pull down the shutters, keep what we have and make sure nobody else benefits as we did.Many have questioned the motives of the ""No"" campaign and its leaders.  Some wonder why, after years of doing business with the US military, some involved in the ""No"" campaign have suddenly found an interest in defending Irish sovereignty and political structures.  Personally, I welcome Libertas's concern for Irish political structures but I am more interested in who ignited this concern and who would gain most from a ""No"" vote.  The United States does not want a strong European Union, as it does not suit its interests.  I am not usually a believer in conspiracy theories but the contributions of Oliver North and other US military luminaries in Central America give cause for grave concern.  It seems the US military establishment would be happiest with a ""No"" vote, and I am concerned that Declan Ganley is the political wing of the US military generals.  This is a dangerous and sinister situation.  I thank the Acting Chairman for his forbearance."	spk_551
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-05-28	dail	30	Constituency Commission Report: Statements (Resumed). 	dbsect_25	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue as it is important to debate an issue that will affect all politicians.  The terms of reference for the commission as set out in section 6 of the Electoral Act 1997 state:A Constituency Commission shall, in observing the relevant provisions of the Constitution in relation to Dáil constituencies, have regard to the following:Section 6 of the Electoral Act 1997 lays down the terms of reference for the Constituency Commission.  Section 6(20)(While residents in Terenure can call on Deputies from two constituencies, due to its divided administrative structure many issues raised at residents' association meetings are not always relevant to all Deputies and councillors.  Very often when the full complement of Deputies, councillors and Dublin city council officials attends a meeting, there are more on the officialdom side than on the  residents' due to the weakened sense of community.  I hope there will be an opportunity to reflect on the commission's recommendations for areas such as Terenure and it is brought either into Dublin South-East or Dublin South-Central.  The residents would not be disappointed if that were to happen.People believe that Deputies should have an input into constituency revisions.  Yet when we did in the past, people were critical of that.  I am not critical of the Constituency Commission but I hope there is some opportunity to strike a balance.Deputy John Cregan already spoke of the 13,000 people from the Limerick West constituency being moved to the Kerry North constituency which will have an impact.  They have been well served in the past by Deputies John Cregan and Niall Collins.  Deputy Thomas McEllistrim is now making efforts to build a political base there.  While I am sure Deputy Jimmy Deenihan will be more than happy to cater for their every concern, people from places like Athea are Limerick born and bred.  The idea of them being in the Kerry North constituency has led to bad feeling and a sense of exclusion has emerged.  They are in limbo because they are not sure who their Deputies are.In the case of Terenure we have missed an opportunity for villages, both urban and rural, to develop, expand and strengthen their sense of community.  I would like if that aspect of the commission's report could be reassessed.	spk_391
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-05-22	dail	30	Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_4	"I wish to share time with Deputy Áine Brady, with the permission of the House.I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this particular issue.  Living in south Dublin and representing Dublin South East, it is obviously a problem that I see and face every day.  Sometimes when people talk to public representatives such as Deputies and councillors, they believe they are detached from the problems of traffic and everyday life, but that certainly is not true.  There is a sense that because we have the Luas, the DART and an increasing number of QBCs, people believe everything is rosy in Dublin 4, 6 and 8, when this is not true at all.  Very many communities are located in those areas, Terenure, Rathgar, Crumlin, Dundrum and Rathfarnham, for instance.  Every morning in the greater Dublin area, in which not everyone has access to public transport, private cars descend on residential and small communities and depart through them in the evening.  In time the DTA will change that, but in the meantime in Dublin South East residents and visitors have a problem because many of the villages such as Ranelagh, Terenure and Rathmines are regarded by the planners and experts in Dublin City Council as obstacles to the delivery of traffic management systems.  They regard these communities as difficulties which have to be overcome — and then they drive through and create arteries through these small village communities.There is a great sense of village and community life in Dublin South East, but most people are commuting through it, with ramifications for the quality of life of residents and families.  In particular, Rathgar and Terenure have literally had a wall built between them, which has divided communities and had a major impact on residents.  The RPA has just carried out a feasibility study to extend the Luas from Christchurch through Terenure and into Rathfarnham, but I am not sure how much further that process will go, given that this is not a natural route in the way the line to Sandyford is — it was traditionally a rail route.  The line through Terenure would mean the displacement of traffic from the main artery into the residential side streets, the compulsory purchase of people's gardens etc.  It would also mean the Luas, for all its advantages, running through settled residential areas and small streets such as Brighton Street and Brighton Square, with major repercussions for residents.  While this has been examined I am not sure how successful it will be, as it would mean the existing QBCs, in effect, will have to be closed down.  Instead of complementing the QBCs, the Luas would, in fact, be replacing and substituting them.  I am not convinced that is the objective when we are looking at public transport options.The infrastructure that Transport 21 will deliver has an enormous impact.  When a road race was organised through the Dublin Port tunnel shortly after it opened — or perhaps just before — I thought people would be wading through water because of the headlines about it over the years to the effect that it was flooding, leaking and so on.  There were major objections to it, but it is a great success from the perspective of residents in the inner city and people visiting Dublin.  It has had an enormous impact on people's lives and reduced the number of heavy goods vehicles significantly, which has had a major impact on schools.  The children attending City Quay school are much safer going there in the mornings.  It is healthier for them, their parents and older people; the port tunnel has made a real difference to the lives of ordinary people and the city of Dublin.The need for a DTA is very clear, and makes sense.  People will find ways of objecting to it, of course, and that is inevitable since they object to everything that comes through the Oireachtas while, at the same time, wondering why things do not happen sooner and more quickly.  The DTA will deliver faster and more reliable public transport.  Reliability and the ability of public transport to arrive on time and deliver people to their destinations on time is the key.  Luas has made an enormous difference and the reason it is so popular is that it is reliable, clean and efficient.  When one leaves home in the morning, one knows one will get to work or to one's destination within 20 minutes or half an hour from the time one arrives on the platform.  While the authority will be powerful, the Minister and elected representatives will be more powerful and will have a direct say in how the authority delivers public transport infrastructure.When the directly elected lord mayor is in place, there may be a turf war between him or her, the authority, the Minister and the councillors.  If the lord mayor is from a different political party from the Minister, it could lead to interesting times ahead for us all.  Members of the Dáil should keep this under review when the procedure for reforming local government is being framed.I was concerned initially that the Dublin transport authority would be another large organisation, such as the HSE, into which Members would have very little input.  This is not the case because I have seen what the Minister has done.  The Minister stated the Government will retain responsibility for setting overall transport policy and determining the broad direction of transport investment policy, as already laid down in Transport 21.  The Minister will approve the authority's transport strategy and will be able to give mandatory policy directions with which the authority will be required to comply.  This power is crucial and can be used to ensure the authority acts in accordance with Government policy.  The authority's chairperson and chief executive will be required to appear before Oireachtas committees, including the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is very important.  It is good that elected representatives, including the Minister, will be able to determine how the authority manages its policy direction.  The legislation allows councillors to sit on the board of the authority.  Those at the coalface of interaction with residents in the city will have an input, which is very important.Chapter 4 obliges the authority to implement appropriate demand management strategies.  This is a reference to the congestion charge.   The Minister stated recently: ""While the introduction of congestion charging in the GDA is not provided for at this stage, the authority will be required to keep the position generally under review and may make recommendations to the Minister if it considers that additional demand management measures are required.""  I welcome this.  In principle, I have no difficulty with a congestion charge but the devil is in the detail.  The required transport infrastructure is not in place and it would, therefore, be very premature to consider a congestion charge for Dublin.  I have no doubt one will be introduced eventually but it is not yet on the cards.  I welcome the Minister's message in this regard.The Dublin transport authority will streamline the decision-making process and will deliver the required infrastructure in the greater Dublin area.  It will also strengthen the interaction between land use, planning and transport.  I commend the Bill to the House."	spk_156

Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-05-08	dail	30	Management Companies (Housing Developments): Motion. 	dbsect_8	The new Government is working hard and constructively on delivering the programme for Government.Not far from here, around Grand Canal Dock in Dublin's docklands area, there are many apartments and the area has been transformed.  This has been a good thing and it has transformed people's lives because it has brought about much needed accommodation and housing stock.  There are difficulties associated with living in apartment blocks and they are particularly isolated, in many ways.  They can be separate communities from the wider community, which can lead to tension.  As a public representative, I believe these challenges are not healthy for either political bodies or apartment communities.  This is something we will have to deal with and the Government will address it.There is clearly a problem.  I spoke to a resident in the docklands area who pays over €2,000 in management charges every year; there are 120 apartments in his block which means a significant amount of money is involved.  Management agents are making big money from all of this and in the case I refer to almost a quarter of a million euro to manage a block of apartments seems excessive.  Many agents have neither bonds nor security and there is clearly a problem because often the agent is appointed by the developer and acts on his or her behalf, rather than on behalf of the residents.  When a developer finishes the last apartment, he or she can high tail it away, leaving the place unfinished.  It can be particularly difficult to get them to come back to complete the job.Residents are suffering, something needs to be done and the Government is addressing this issue.  The legislative programme published in early April indicates that the issue of multi-dwelling buildings is being prioritised.  The publication of legislation that will establish the National Property Services Regulatory Authority, NPSRA, in this Dáil session is a good thing.  There is no doubt that this issue will be dealt with as it is a matter of urgency.  As Deputy O'Connor suggested, people face severe financial difficulties as a result of management agents charging huge amounts of money.  The NPSRA already has a website that is very informative, helpful and consumer-friendly.It is ironic that Fine Gael is calling for a statutory footing for the NPSRA when it has already been agreed that this will happen in this Dáil session and when that party has already expressed concerns at the number of quangos.  Does Fine Gael favour fewer regulatory bodies or more of them?  In my view, the success of the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the need for the NPSRA shows that certain agencies can be effective in dealing with management charges.  This will make a substantial difference.	spk_258
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-04-24	dail	30	Cancer Reports: Statements. 	dbsect_7	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this issue, which is vital to me, my constituents and people throughout the country.  I met Professor Tom Keane who came before the Joint Committee on Health and Children and what he said made me confident that he can deliver the required changes.  I spoke on previous occasions in support of the national cancer strategy.  I am of the view, now more than ever, that said strategy will be delivered upon by the Minister and Professor Keane.We need to focus on survival rates among cancer patients.  It has been proven that these rates are 20% higher where patients are treated at centres of excellence.  Such centres are key to improving survival rates.There is no doubt that reform of the health service will be difficult.  All the more reason then that we should drive such reform and change.  By definition, reform means change.  Reform alters people's boundaries and takes them out of their comfort zones.  It also leads to people seeing themselves as winners or losers in some sort of battle.Each hospital forms part of a jigsaw.  The Government is obliged to consider the whole as opposed to merely focusing on individual pieces.  The ultimate goal as regards reform of the health service is the improvement of standards of patient care, an increase in survival rates and the provision of the most up-to-date treatments.  We have started out on that road.  Our journey will be long and difficult but, ultimately, it will be effective and results will be delivered.Early diagnosis is the key to delivering improved survival rates.  When early diagnosis becomes the norm, multidisciplinary teams must be in place to deal with the large throughput of cancer-related illnesses.  Doctors must be familiar with the broad range of cancer treatments and the side effects thereof.  They must not work in isolation from others involved in the care of individual patients.  Everyone dealing with a particular patient must work together and communicate with each other.  It should not be the case that medical teams treat different parts of illnesses in isolation.  Patients will suffer unless an approach that is all-encompassing is taken.Hospitals will lose services as the latter are transferred elsewhere.  However, we must ensure the needs of cancer patients remain to the fore.  In my constituency of Dublin South-East there have been proposals for a transfer of services from St. Luke's to St. James's.  St. Luke's is a wonderful facility with excellent staff and the environment is positive for anyone who is ill and recovering from cancer.  If we are required to transfer services to St. James's to improve matters and if more people will survive as a result of such a transfer, we must go ahead with the move.  The transferral of services to St. James's will allow St. Luke's to develop other services on the existing site, which is clearly in the interests of the health service.Deputy Charles Flanagan said that we must learn lessons, but the establishment of HIQA and the appointment of Professor Keane are examples of learning from past mistakes.  The recent Barringtons and O'Malley reports were distressing.  I also extend my sympathy and support to those involved in their recovery.  These reports have highlighted the real need to bring about change by establishing these centres of excellence as soon as we can.	spk_225
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-04-24	dail	30	Local Authority Housing.	dbsect_22	I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue, namely, the introduction of a sale of flats scheme.  Such a scheme must be introduced because it would be an extremely important social inclusion measure.  When the sale of houses scheme for council tenants, there were huge improvements in estates throughout the country, particularly those in Dublin.The difficulty is that many people live in substandard accommodation in Dublin City Council flat complexes.  Fire safety in many of these complexes is not adequate.  There was a fire recently in one of the top floor flats at the Beech Hill complex in Donnybrook in my constituency and firefighters could not gain access from the rear of the building.  That is not acceptable.  The fire regulations must be changed so that people can raise their children in an atmosphere of security and safety.The standard of electric wiring in many flats is not acceptable and needs to be upgraded as a matter of urgency.  The position in respect of drainage is similar, with sewerage pipes running through people's flats and, in many cases, their kitchens.  Flats are regularly flooded as a result of old and rusting pipes.Those who live on the top floor of flat complexes experience continual problems with leaks because many of their roofs need repair.  These roofs are often repaired but within months the problem returns and there is a need for further repair.  This is an expensive process.Bedrooms in flats are often tiny and this accentuates the difficulty that arises in the context of overcrowding.  Even if a sale of flats scheme is introduced, most of those who live in council flats in Dublin will not be able to avail of it because their homes are in such a substandard condition.  It would be wrong for the council to sell substandard flats to tenants who are eager to buy.Many people have stated that there is a need for a sale of flats scheme and that it must be introduced as quickly as possible.  However, we must get it right and ensure that we do not sell second-hand goods to tenants.  It will be possible for those flats that are refurbished to be sold under the scheme when it is finally introduced.  However, those which are not refurbished will not be sold.The redevelopment of flat complexes is ongoing.  I refer here to the complexes at Charlemont Street and York Street. Other redevelopment projects are already in the pipeline.  However, this is not sufficient.  We need a redevelopment scheme in respect of which a clear timeframe for commencing and completing works will be set down.  The flat complexes at Beech Hill, Mercer House, located a stone's throw from the Dáil, Glover's Court, Bishop Street, Ringsend, Irishtown, Rathmines and Pearse Street are in a substandard condition and should be redeveloped.Tenants deserve to live in modern and safe accommodation.  The Government must ensure that flat complexes are redeveloped to such a degree that their tenants will be able to avail of a sale of flats scheme, were it to be introduced.  The residents of most of the flat complexes to which I refer would not be in a position to avail of such a scheme.  People have invested a great deal of money in their flats and, like those who own the houses in which they live, they want to pass them on to their family members.  They should be entitled to do so and I ask the Minister of State to ensure the scheme to which I refer is introduced as a matter of urgency.	spk_412

Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-04-10	dail	30	Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_5	"I commend the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2008 to the House.  Over the next two months we will hear both sides of the debate on accepting or rejecting the Lisbon reform treaty.  Two guiding questions must be asked by all voters.  First, what would the impact be on Ireland if we were to vote ""No""?  Second, how will this treaty affect the voter?A ""No"" vote would have a serious impact on Ireland's economy and people.  We have heard many reminders about how beneficial membership of the EU has been for Ireland.  As Deputy Moynihan stated, education was one key area.  Foreign direct investment was only €16 million in 1972 while today it is billions of euro.  The workforce has more than doubled, social rights have improved significantly and Structural Funds have contributed to improving our infrastructure.  We are now part of the strongest currencies and have unfettered access to a growing market of 500 million people.Ireland's relationship with the EU has been a very positive one.  The ""No"" campaign, on the other hand, is pulling up the drawbridge before less fortunate member states can get on board.  Theirs is a selfish and thoughtless position to keep what we have achieved for ourselves.  Being part of a wider regional political and economic entity enabled us to modernise in many ways.  We are a small open economy.  It would never make sense for us to go it alone.A ""No"" vote would indicate to our economic trading partners, both in the EU and outside, that we are pursuing an isolationist policy.  A ""No"" vote would reduce, not increase, our speaking voice in European institutions.  While Ireland will lose a commissionership for five out of every 15 years, the consequences of this change are being exaggerated.  Every state will lose a commissionership for the same length of time.  A more streamlined, efficient and co-ordinated Commission will be better equipped to deal with future challenges.  Some ask if it makes a difference if there are 18 or 27 Commissioners.  The answer is ""Yes"".  The EU is facing more challenges in 2008 than when the six founding member states came together in the 1952 to form the European Coal and Steel Community.  Any other successful organisation would alter its rules to reflect major changes.  The EU should not be any different.A ""No"" vote would signal to investors that Ireland is not fully committed to the EU.  The timing of the referendum, when we are seeing signs of an economic slowdown due to the global credit crunch, could not be more significant.  Due to our Constitution, we have an opportunity to signal to investors our commitment to Europe — no other member state has this chance.How will the treaty affect the individual voter?  To many people, the EU is regarded as something that happens in Brussels and may not directly affect their lives.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The EU has a direct impact on many aspects of our lives through our currency, regulations and directives in the areas of food safety, employment and human rights law, common travel areas and common markets.  We are also part of an economic unit that provides a counterbalance to the US.The five main changes to be introduced by the Lisbon treaty are a two and a half year presidency of the Council instead of a rotating six-month one, the reduction of the Commission from 27 to 18 in 2014, the increase in the legislative powers of the European Parliament, the increase in the role of national parliaments and making the Charter of Fundamental Rights a legally binding document.  These changes will affect the individual and quite simply, they will make the European Union better equipped to face future challenges.  In particular, it will be able to deal with modern global challenges, such as climate change, transnational crime and trafficking, immigration, significant changes brought about by population increases and the threat of pandemic diseases.A longer-term EU Presidency will provide a more coherent and co-ordinated policy and will allow the EU to play a leadership role when needed.  A more streamlined Commission will, similarly, enable more effective policy making.  The expansion of the role of both the European Parliament and national parliaments will create a more democratic and transparent Union, enabling citizens to have a more direct input.Another example of this is the citizens' initiative, whereby citizens can make a proposal directly once they have a million signatures.  The Minister last week reminded us that in 1979, when the European Parliament was first directly elected, it had no legislative power.  The EU is therefore moving at a very steady pace towards becoming more democratic and transparent, and not less transparent as one could imagine by listening to some people.  As well as being more democratic, the EU will have a more co-ordinated method of policy making.The side advocating a ""No"" vote would lead one to believe the Lisbon treaty is undemocratic and a bad deal for Ireland.  I honestly cannot see the logic in those arguments.  That side contends we are heading towards increased militarisation and a common tax base, all of which are issues being used to try to spook voters.  The arguments are without foundation as the triple lock mechanism is protected and we maintain unanimity in the tax area.  There is no Irish support, either politically or in the business sphere, for a move towards tax harmonisation.  The Lisbon treaty does not give up control in this area.That Ireland is the only country holding a referendum means we have a great opportunity to have Ireland's voice heard on the international stage.  We can signal our commitment and ability to continue to shape European policy in the years ahead.Over the next two months there is no doubt we will see a very broad range of arguments and issues but this treaty has already received endorsements from a variety of social partners, including employers' group IBEC and the farming group, the IFA, which Deputy Durkan knows well.  There is significant support for this and the treaty will be approved, although not without good, clear and coherent arguments.  That is what this Government is facilitating and I compliment Deputy Roche on his Trojan efforts to get across the message.People are always indicating they do not have enough information but there are tonnes of information out there if people make any effort to look for it.  Sometimes when people indicate they do not understand something, it means they do not really want to.  It is our job to deliver the message to the doorsteps, which we will do.I ask voters, when making up their minds, to do so on the basis of two questions.  These are what the treaty will do for Ireland and what it will do for the individual.  When voters reflect on those questions, they will realise this treaty is good for Ireland, other smaller nations and Europe as a whole."	spk_147

Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-04-09	dail	30	Cluster Munitions Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_29	"The broad support to which I refer was inspired by the successful campaign against the use of landmines.  The convention on cluster bombs will be every bit as successful.It is important to remember that national co-operation is vital to the achievement of international co-operation.  It is only with the latter that we can make some lasting improvements to the quality of life of those in war-torn areas whose lives have been so badly affected.As previous speakers indicated, Ireland is playing a leading role in international efforts to negotiate the convention on cluster bombs.  I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his Department on all they have done to date.  Their Trojan work has led to the holding of the conference to which reference has been made in Dublin in May.  That conference will create a huge amount of goodwill among the international community and will raise Ireland's profile.  We hope it will also lead to a positive outcome.  I have no doubt the latter will prove to be the case.According to the Cluster Munitions Coalition, which is an international network, cluster munitions are stockpiled by more than 70 states.  This implies that an overwhelming proportion of the world's population are affected by these weapons.  Cluster munitions were first used in the Second World War.  They were later used during the Vietnam War and created major difficulties in Laos.  More recently, they were again used in the Israeli invasion of Lebanon during its conflict with Hizbollah.  Cluster bombs are also being used on Europe's doorstep in Kosovo.  I visited Kosovo last November and met a child who lost a limb as a result of a cluster bomb exploding.  It was harrowing to see the damage done to that child.Ireland's commitment to achieving its target is undisputed.  The programme for Government commits us to a campaign for a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions.  In the absence of a complete ban, we will seek an agreement on an immediate freeze on such munitions pending the establishment of effective international instruments to address humanitarian concerns regarding their use.While I understand the Opposition's desire to enact domestic legislation, I support the Minister for Foreign Affairs' position that we should not prejudge or second-guess the outcome of the conference in May.  We are taking a comprehensive approach to the development of the treaty and the most important thing is that we should encourage other states to become involved and support this initiative.  International treaties do not come about overnight.  A major amount of work is required in respect of them in the background at and on the fringes of many international conferences.  Ireland is one of seven states — the others are Norway, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Peru and the Holy See — driving the Oslo process.We must acknowledge that while making something illegal is extremely important, it is not the sole tool by which problems can be combated.  In that context, I wish to recall the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who said: ""Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal"".  The law in itself is not enough.  We must support the law by issuing a moral condemnation of the use of weapons such as those under discussion.  We must also provide humanitarian and financial support.Ireland is working in close co-operation with NGOs and UN agencies to comprehensively address issues raised by the existence of unexploded cluster bombs.  I welcome the work being done in this area by the Department of Foreign Affairs on the international stage in co-operation with the NGOs.  I wish the Minister every success with the diplomatic conference inMay."	spk_477
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-03-12	dail	30	Cancer Services Reports: Motion. 	dbsect_11	I thank Deputy Fleming for allowing me to share time.  The implementation of the cancer control strategy is the major priority for this Government, as it is for every member of Fianna Fáil.  The overriding objective of the strategy is to deliver high quality, fully integrated, multi-disciplinary cancer care at a national level.  Cancer patients deserve nothing less.Like every other Member of this House, I have had experience of the health services.  Most of my experience has been good and I speak highly of the people working on the front line with whom we come into contact.  There is no sense that people in the Government are somehow detached from the reality of the health service.  People are well aware of the difficulties facing the Minister and the management of the HSE.  Professor Drumm is extremely capable and is the right man for the job.  Anytime he has come before committees of this House, he has acquitted himself exceptionally well.  He has certainly shown that he has a very comprehensive knowledge of his brief.The reorganisation of cancer services is at the heart of the strategy and it is imperative that the decisions of the HSE on the designated cancer centres are implemented without delay.  However, when I hear people like Deputy Perry and go back to my own constituency, I am aware that it is so political.  Some Deputies are just looking towards the next election and that is not the way forward.  If we are serious in bringing about change, we must bite the bullet sometimes.  Deputy Perry's actions would show that we are not willing to do anything and that we want to put our short-term political interests first.  We must have a perspective on this.The implementation of the managed cancer control networks will necessitate a tapering of the additional capacity at the cancer centres.  That will be in tandem with the sequential withdrawal of services from other locations.  One of the most significant strategic issues facing cancer services is the variation in survival rates in Ireland.  We have relatively poor cancer survival rates for many common cancers when compared with other European countries.  This can be attributed in part to the fragmentation of cancer surgery services whereby too many hospitals and consultants are involved in the provision of treatment for cancer services.  The national cancer control strategy provides a clear framework through which this can be addressed and which will lead to improvements in survival.This is all about getting the right care for the right person in the right place at the right time.  I recently had a knee operation at the sports clinic in Santry.  The consultant that operated is experienced.  He sees that type of case regularly every week and that has to be the way we deal with our cancer.	spk_300

Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-03-04	dail	30	Anti-Social Behaviour: Motion. 	dbsect_21	I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on an extremely important issue.  First I express my sympathies to the families of the two Polish men murdered recently in Dublin.  Their parents lost these two sons to emigration less than a year ago, which must have been difficult for them at that time.  To bring their children home in a box must be particularly traumatic and my sympathies are with them.I attended the remembrance mass last night in Drimnagh and it was heartening to see a community reclaim and restate its own sense of community after such horrible and cruel murders.  There is no doubt that crime is a major challenge to every society in the world and Ireland is no different.  It seems as we become wealthier as a nation, we become more detached as a community.As the Minister stated, no crime is victimless and nobody deserves to be the subject of an act of violence.  Earlier today I heard Deputy Rabbitte asking what the Minister was going to do about groups of young people loitering with intent.  I only caught the comment briefly so I may be misinterpreting what the Deputy said.  Unfortunately, this is the sort of perception that does not assist anyone when making an effort to deal with an extremely sensitive issue.It is important to remember that not every group of young people will attack older people when they walk by and not every older person realises that the noisy group in front of them is not about to assault that person.  There is clearly a disconnect between older people and young people and a lack of understanding of youth culture.  Young people are not aware of how older people feel when they see a large group of young people shouting or enjoying themselves.  This disconnect must be addressed and, as Fr. Cosgrove said at last night's mass, this must be done from the ground up.  It must be done in schools, youth clubs and sports clubs, and most importantly, at home by parents.  We do not need more legislation, we need more education.I am glad this issue is receiving attention both within this Chamber and from the media.  I am glad this Government has clearly prioritised the health and safety of its citizens.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, whom we have just heard, is at the helm of a Department which is successfully providing resources to tackle crime, combating the causes of crime and dealing with the aftermath, which is just as important.  The Minister listens and when there is a national conversation on crime it is important to have a Minister who does this.There is no doubt that those who carry out criminal offences do so for a number of reasons.  As there is not a single reason, there is not a single measure that will cure all our ills.  One Department will not resolve all the issues around crime.  The advocates of locking people up and throwing away the key will sound good.  We should face the fact that this motion and the rhetoric addressing it appeal to our collective sense of fear and concern for the health and safety of children and parents.  The motion does not offer any real solutions because what is needed is a complex set of actions.  The Minister and this Government are working to lead and not scare people.One piece, and only one small piece, in the jigsaw is policing.  This is vital in ensuring not only that criminals are caught but also to provide reassurance and security to ordinary citizens.  The programme for Government has committed to an increase in gardaí to 15,000 by 2010 and 16,000 by 2012.  I am told we are on track to reach this target.The Department has also launched a 2008 policing plan.  This outlines key objectives for 2008, including the facilitation of joint policing committees; the tackling of gun crime, organised crime and drugs; and increasing public order.  The plan includes a commitment to a publicity campaign directed at the use of knives in serious crime.  The plan creates closer synergy between local authorities and Garda divisions.  Resources have clearly been provided by the Government to the Garda to the tune of €1.6 billion in 2008, an increase of 11% since 2007.There is no doubt the consumption of alcohol plays a major role in crime.  Garda activity has been very strong in this area and in my constituency of Dublin South-East there has been a concerned effort to address this issue.  There has been an increase of 19.7% in the detection of possession of drugs for sale or supply and this has a deterrent effect on potential criminals.This Government has also prioritised the need to discourage under age drinking and anti-social behaviour.  This has been backed up by legislation including the Intoxicating Liquor Act amended in 2000, which provides for closure orders for serving under age persons.  We have recently seen a debate on the selling of alcohol in outlets such as petrol stations and supermarkets.  I strongly believe there should be a complete ban on the sale of alcohol in supermarkets and petrol stations.  Unless this is done we are just asking for trouble.  It is healthy that we engage in this debate and question the effect of easy access to alcohol, particularly for young people.  In my constituency of Dublin South-East, I see many local community groups working very hard on the ground, providing sports facilities and activities for young people. There is no doubt that this has a positive impact and discourages children from turning to anti-social behaviour.Fianna Fáil-led Governments have rightly invested significant sums of money in improving facilities for young people.  Ringsend Park is a tribute to this commitment and we need to continue creating and improving facilities for young people.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, is continuing to tackle the drugs problem through the national drugs strategy and is in the course of preparing a new strategy.Nobody would deny that knife crime must be combated as a matter of urgency.  However, as the Minister indicated, it is a complex issue and what this Opposition motion is omitting is that there has been a mixture of trends in recent years.  For example, there was an increase in headline crime of 1.7% in 2007 but the level of crime per 1,000 people has actually decreased.  There was a reduction in the number of burglaries by 5.4% in 2007 and the number of stabbings increased to 36 in 2007.I notice in the motion a focus on the use of knives.  As far as I am aware, a number of deaths by stabbing not too far away from here in Dublin South-East have occurred with the use of kitchen knives.  These knives were not bought in a knife shop or procured illegally.  These people went home, picked knives from a drawer and then committed the stabbing.  So how does the Opposition propose to deal with knives in our kitchen drawers?  The motion sounds dramatic but it demonstrates that the Opposition wants headlines rather than to tackle the issues in a serious way.  The motion's focus on the availability of knives detracts from the complexity of the issue.  It is not just about availability, as the Opposition would have us believe, as there are knives in every kitchen in the country.  Instead it is about tackling the root causes of violence as well as ensuring the provision of necessary resources.This Government is prioritising crime.  We have increased resources and funding.  The new policing plan for 2008 has been launched and as a result, the number of gardaí will be increased to 15,000 in 2010.  An holistic approach that recognises the multifaceted nature of crime has been adopted.  I am certain this Government and the Minister are working effectively on this issue.	spk_420
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-02-27	dail	30	Student Support Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_33	"I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Student Support Bill 2008.  As the Minister of State has heard from previous speakers, this Bill is broadly welcomed.  I also welcome it.  It will streamline the student grant scheme by providing a statutory framework for the replacement of four different schemes operated by local authorities and VECs with one unified system.  Having previously been a member of the CDVEC, which is based in Ballsbridge, I know from personal experience that the VECs are particularly efficient and professional organisations in the provision of education services.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Connor, was a member of County Dublin VEC from 1985 to 1991, representing the Tallaght area, and he too speaks highly of the contribution made by VECs.  The VECs have been flexible in the way in which they have managed to change the courses and services they provide to young people in third level education.  They have met the needs of business and society.This Bill will reduce the number of grant-awarding authorities from 66 to 33.  As somebody who becomes annoyed when I see the number of administrative bodies being increased, I am pleased to see the reverse occurring.  This will leave VECs as the sole arbiter of grant allocation.  The move has been welcomed by the Union of Students in Ireland and Aontas, the adult education group.  In some respects, this is a housekeeping Bill that aims to tidy up the current administrative system.  However, it does also make some significant changes, one of which is an independent appeals board, which will reduce the number of fraudulent claims.  It also provides a new residence requirement of three years rather than one year, which will bring Ireland into line with other EU member states.The Bill is important because it shows the Government is committed to improving and providing education.  It cares about equality of access to education.  Education has always been important and will become even more so in the event of a slowdown in the economy.  Education and human capital have been and will continue to be the linchpin of our economy.  We have experienced unprecedented economic growth over the last 15 years.  This has been led by the human capital of which I speak, although of course we also had a well managed fiscal regime and an economic environment which was conducive to foreign investment.  However, our well educated people have always been the cornerstone of the success of our economy.  Nobody would deny that the high level of education within the Irish workforce was central to the economic boom.  Not only can high-tech firms base themselves here, but we also have the requisite educational assets to support such foreign and indigenous industries.It is vital that we continue to support and administer third level education in the best manner possible.  It is all about people forming and shaping the backbone of our economy.  In light of a possible slowdown in our economy people will become much more important.  It is important to educate and upskill our workforce, particularly people in areas such as those represented by the Acting Chairman in Tallaght, and in Ringsend and Pearse Street in my constituency.  It has been difficult to get people to move from work to education.  Employment is the best social inclusion measure but to go beyond that we must ensure that people from disadvantaged areas build on the opportunity to take up education.Deputy Quinn mentioned that it is a long way from Ringsend and Pearse Street to college.  In some ways it is further from Ringsend and Pearse Street than from Sligo or Roscommon because it is difficult to break down mindsets.  Community leaders work hard to break that mindset where people see education and college as a distant dream.  This Bill will address and change this.  The change in the income limits will assist in changing the mindset.Society is judged by how it looks after its weakest members.  No one in this country should be prohibited from attending third level education and obtaining skills and experience that are ultimately returned to society.  It is a cliché to state that we are investing in our future when we educate people.Any move towards simplifying the grants system is welcome, particularly for mature students who deserve a second chance at education.  When people return to college after a few years working it can be difficult.  They may have children and they may need to be supported.  My wife returned to third level education when we had two very young children.  It required a major effort on her behalf.  Any measure that helps to attract people to upskilling and education must be applauded and the Government is to be applauded for doing so through this Bill.A recent report by the library and research service in the Oireachtas indicated that this Bill would have a positive impact on national competitiveness: ""Those students who are supported will contribute to the intellectual capital of the State, and thereby improve the national competitiveness of the country by contributing to the further development of a knowledge based economy.""There are approximately 150,000 students in third level and 57,000 are in receipt of grants.  That is a high number, one I hope will continue to grow.  We need to encourage and promote people from inner city areas to enter education.  If we are to compete on the international stage it is vital that we ensure a vibrant third level education system.  I therefore welcome this Bill which creates a single application process, improves access and promotes greater transparency."	spk_508

Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-02-06	dail	30	Finance Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_25	I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate the Finance Bill, which is welcome.  It introduces supports for business, makes the tax system fairer and lightens the burden on low and middle-income earners.  The principal aims of the Bill are to support enterprise and innovation, to advance sustainable development and ensure a fair tax system.As a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Joint Committee on Finance I welcome these moves.  In particular, I welcome the continuing trend of supporting small and medium sized business.  Small and medium sized businesses account for up to 40% of the Irish workforce and represent a vital component of the economy, but not just the economy.  It is also important to the social infrastructure in the communities across Dublin and the country.  Operating both domestically and internationally, small and medium industries provide invaluable goods and services in support of larger industries.Today, Dublin City Enterprise Board came before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  One of the biggest challenges facing the enterprise board was the lack of space for its start-up businesses.  One way of solving the problem of lack of space for start-up businesses would be to let entrepreneurs listen to the Opposition because that would certainly deaden any enthusiasm an entrepreneur would have for starting a business.  Thankfully, entrepreneurs do not listen to the Opposition, which is why we have a healthy and strong economy.	spk_303

The fund will support investments in staff, equipment and technology in order to increase competitiveness and encourage new exports.  Such supports are to be welcomed, particularly in a more competitive environment.The Finance Bill helps SMEs by reducing the administrative burden and making doing business easier.  The Bill provides for measures to assist small businesses which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, introduced in last year's budget.  It includes a number of business-friendly measures such as revised preliminary tax payment arrangements for corporation tax aimed at small and start-up companies and an increase in VAT registration thresholds for small business to €37,500 in the case of services and €75,000 in the case of goods.This Bill represents a range of business-friendly measures which will support continued growth and job creation in a climate of economic uncertainty.  Within Europe, Ireland is third in a league of countries that encourage start-up businesses, which shows that Irish people embrace challenges and change, and are adaptable to change.  This is why we have continued to progress so well.  The Bill will support those who want to take a chance to improve their lives and the life of the community in which they live and work.	spk_306
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-02-06	dail	30	Finance Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_25	One of the ways in which the Bill protects the less well-off in society is by creating a fairer tax system.  The Social Welfare Bill made significant improvements to social welfare payments, including pensions and carer's allowance, among other measures.  The Finance Bill aims to reward those at work.  It does so by giving increases in personal tax credits and tax bands to ensure that low income earners are kept out of the standard rate band and average earners are kept out of the higher rate band.  Tax credits have been increased for the elderly, lone parents, widowed persons, including widowed parents, and those with a disability or those who care for a person with a disability.Those who wish to get their first step on the property ladder should now find it considerably easier due to the changes, which include further increases in the ceilings up to which first-time buyers can claim mortgage interest relief and substantial reform of the stamp duty regime for residential property.	spk_308
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2008-02-06	dail	30	Finance Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_25	The old system has been replaced by an exemption of €125,000, a 7% rate on the next €875,000 and a 9% rate on sums above that.  A measure which is often overlooked but which will create more flexibility for individuals is the reduction in the stamp duty claw-back provision for new residences and for first-time buyers from five to two years.The Bill also prioritises the environment.  Practical measures are necessary to help protect our economy and environment.  A new tax initiative for energy efficient equipment will allow companies to claim the full cost, in the year of purchase, of specified energy efficient equipment against their taxable income.  The purpose is to assist in improving cost competitiveness while helping to reduce overall energy demand and carbon emissions.The Bill provides for a fundamental reform of the vehicle registration system.  It will provide the opportunity for people to make choices to help the environment and provide financial incentives to do so.  The VRT system is being revised to take greater account of carbon dioxide emissions, with VRT exemption for series production electric cars and up to €2,500 VRT relief for certain series production hybrid and flexible fuel cars.  Over time, this will have to change and become more finely tuned.  This is the first step in having the economy and the environment work more closely together.  People recognise the benefits.  The green agenda has moved to centre stage.  Fianna Fáil and the Greens have recognised this and we are now putting it into practice.	spk_310

They have not come to terms with that fact.The Bill will make the business expansion scheme more accessible for recycling companies and also provides for a reduction in the VAT rate applicable on certain supplies used for the agricultural production of biofuels from 21% to 13.5%.In summary, I welcome the Bill because it supports small and medium enterprises, which are and will continue to be the linchpin of our economy.  It provides a fairer tax system, which benefits lower income earners, and it provides financial incentives to protect the environment, which will provide for future generations.  In an uncertain world economy, it is vital that we continue to strive for a balance that encourages enterprise and protects the less well-off in society.  This is exactly what the Bill does, which is why I support it.	spk_314

I am glad this motion has been brought before the House because it gives us the opportunity to take stock of the measures that have been taken in the provision of health services.  The motion refers to a number of issues, including cystic fibrosis and mental health.  This public debate must seem like a double-edged sword for those suffering from cystic fibrosis and indeed mental illness, and their families who carry much of the accompanying difficulties and hardship.  On the one hand, this debate gives voice to those who are suffering and ensures the issue stays top of the agenda.  On the other, it must be very difficult for those families and individuals listening to various experiences of hardship.  It is therefore a double-edged sword, but on balance it is a good way to raise these issues.I heard Deputy Upton refer to Joe Duffy leading the charge.

Everybody is concerned about the eradication of the invasive pneumococcal disease, a life threatening disease that can cause pneumonia, septicemia and pneumococcal meningitis.  A significant number of countries throughout the world, including the United States and the United Kingdom, already include this vaccine in their vaccination programmes.  Northern Ireland has made the vaccine available for some time, so it would be sensible to introduce the vaccine on an all-Ireland basis.  Canada, Mexico, Australia and Costa Rica as well as 11 other European countries routinely vaccinate children against this nasty and terrible disease.Pneumococcal meningitis is the second most common type of meningitis in Ireland.  It is the only preventable form of the disease that we do not routinely vaccinate against.  Infants from birth to 24 months, children with weakened immune systems and children who attend day care are especially at risk of developing invasive pneumococcal disease.  In April, the Minister for Health and Children, speaking at a health conference, announced that the national immunisation schedule was to be expanded to include routine immunisation of children against this disease and hepatitis B.  It was due to be in place by last September but that has not happened.  When will it be introduced and what Minister of State will be responsible for rolling it out?At the same conference, Dr. Kevin Connolly, a member of the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, which recommended the addition of the pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccine to the Government, said he expected the new vaccines to be introduced last September.

Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-12-18	dail	30	Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007: Second Stage. 	dbsect_23	I wish to share time with Deputy Finian McGrath.I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  In recent years, the health system has been the subject of widespread debate.  I have great sympathy for anybody who works in the health services because morale must be extremely low.  We all know people who work in the health services but anybody who admits to doing so inevitably receives sympathy.  Reform of the health system is the main priority for the Government and every Deputy.It is important to highlight the hard work that is carried out by so many members of the Health Service Executive.  It is easy to knock and to condemn.  Everyone likes to be critical at times because it is the easy thing to do.  However, being proactive, thoughtful and detailed in one's responses to problems does not appear to be as easy.  Certainly, although the Opposition is very good at being negative, this does not do anything for their case or for the health system overall.Deputies O'Sullivan and Ó Caoláin mentioned the issue of co-location because they believe it will reinforce the two-tier health system.  People I meet in the street tell me they do not care if there are five tiers in the health system.  They want proper care and to be able to access the services.  If co-location brings this about, it should be rolled out quickly for them.Deputy O'Sullivan also mentioned that she supports cutbacks in areas in which there is waste.  The Deputy and the Opposition in general should point out where and by whom such resources in the health system are being wasted.  Recently, I heard an Opposition spokesperson on a radio programme calling for firm, decisive management and for proper management of the health service.  However, on the same radio programme, the same person then called for exceptions to be made in individual cases.  One cannot have it both ways.Although many good people work in the health service, they are becoming increasingly afraid to make good decisions.  In a way, they are damned if they do and damned if they do not.  While it may not be popular to make this point, a large number of good people work in the health system.  We have good consultants, health care managers and pharmacists who need to be supported and encouraged.  However, they are assaulted on a daily basis.  While people always state that they are not criticising individuals within a particular section of the health service, this is not the case.  Such individuals are being criticised and people's morale is being damaged.  This is not because of criticism The HSE was founded in 2005 and is the State's biggest employer, with more than 120,000 employees.  Many of them work at the coalface and treat patients on a daily basis.  Amidst recent controversies, it is important not to forget the invaluable work being done by many of the HSE's staff.  Its staff should become proud to state that they work in the HSE and in the health service.  All families have experience of the hospital services.  My personal experiences have been highly positive within both the private and public health care systems.  The people who work in this sector are fantastic.  In general, the consultants are excellent professionals who regularly work above and beyond the call of duty.  Naturally they will argue for their own position, which is part of the process.  The same is true of pharmacists, who are arguing the case in respect of the payments scheme.  Although they are making arguments on this issue, pharmacists would be the first to acknowledge the existence of difficulties, which always will be present.  This constitutes part of negotiating and negotiation is a good part of the process.  While it sometimes can be somewhat torturous or slow, it has worked for years and continues to so do.  It is important to embrace dialogue and consultation.I read in today's edition of one of the newspapers an assertion on the part of a commentator that the health system is under-resourced.  How often must Members listen to such complete nonsense?  Almost everyone now accepts that the system is not under-resourced.  While there are question marks over where resources are going and the manner in which they are being spent, there should not be a debate on this subject.  However, one is obliged to listen to nonsense to the effect that the health system is under-resourced.  Clearly, this is not the case.  In the most recent budget, the Government provided almost €16.2 billion for health in 2008.  This constitutes an increase of more than €1 billion on the 2006 allocation.  Of this sum, more than €700 million is for the capital programme.  Further budgetary provisions include increased allocations for cancer care, the elderly, people with disabilities and children, all of which are very welcome.  Although it is clear there is not a problem regarding funding, commentators still trot out that old chestnut about the lack thereof.I acknowledge there will always be problems and challenges within the system and that improvements can always be made.  It is important to be cognisant of the hard work and commitment of people in the health service.  I refer again to my personal experiences.  All Members know people who work in the health service and know they work particularly hard.  While Opposition Members like to claim there is waste, they are unwilling to point out its location in any detail.  It is like listening to a pub conversation consisting entirely of broad brush stroke stuff and without any detail.  The Opposition Members should come up with details on where and on what services they propose to make cutbacks.The waiting times for accident and emergency services have been improved by 50%.  Approximately 3,300 patients a day attend accident and emergency departments, of whom approximately one quarter require admission.  Patients in the majority of the 32 accident and emergency departments do not wait long for admission but are admitted directly to beds.  Obviously, a number of hospitals are causing some problems.  That is more to do with a desire to be involved in politics instead of running the hospitals.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has been a great success.  People from my constituency of Dublin South-East have availed of this scheme and have found it to be fantastic.  This constitutes a success story.In a recent survey conducted by UCD and Lansdowne Market Research, it was reported that waiting times for hospital admission now are less than three months for 91% of patients.  A total of 76% of patients stated that they were admitted to hospital immediately on being informed they required admission.  A further 11% were admitted within one month and a further 4% were admitted within three months.I was particularly delighted to note the arrival in Ireland of Professor Tom Keane, who has brought great benefit to cancer services in British Columbia.  He attended the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children today and was highly positive and encouraging.  He spoke of the enormous success in paediatric oncology.  Clearly, the HSE, the health service and the people working within it have delivered a top-class service in paediatric oncology and should be applauded for it.  This Bill is in the public interest and I will lend my support to it.	spk_252
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-12-12	dail	30	Social Welfare Bill 2007: Second Stage (Resumed).	dbsect_23	I fully support the changes being introduced by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, in the Social Welfare Bill 2007.  The increase of €900 million in next year's social welfare support package will benefit more than 1.5 million people — one third of the population of the State — and will bring total social welfare expenditure to a record €17 billion in 2008.  I am proud to live in a country with a Government that places such importance on social welfare and equality.  It is a great time to be Irish because the Government is ensuring that the weakest and most vulnerable people in society are protected.Critics of Fianna Fáil sometimes suggest that it does not prioritise welfare and justice.  They argue that it is more interested in economics than in people.  Anyone who examines the provisions of budget 2008 will see that the hallmark of this Fianna Fáil-led Government is its willingness to protect the incomes of vulnerable people and support ordinary working people.  Approximately 76% of the money allocated under the recent budget will be spent on health, social welfare and education.  The provision of public goods in such a manner will be of direct benefit to lower-income families.  This budget clearly puts people first.  It makes significant improvements in the supports given to pensioners, carers, families, children and people with disabilities, all within the overall framework of the programme for Government, Towards 2016 and the national action plan for social inclusion, which sets out a long-term strategic vision and a road map for the future.A generous €336 million package is to be put in place to support older people.  The contributory pension will increase by €14 per week and the non-contributory pension will increase by €12 per week.  Almost 420,000 pensioners will benefit from those pension increases.  The increases being made in this Bill represent the first step towards achieving the target, set in the programme for Government, of increasing the old age pension to €300 per week by 2012.  As Deputy Brady said, older people deserve to be treated well and with respect and dignity.  It is important that we protect the status of older people in society by ensuring they receive decent pensions.  A more generous pension system will also ensure a higher standard of living.  At a time when loneliness and social exclusion are constant threats, of which we always have to be vigilant, we must continue to ensure that older people receive recognition for what they have already contributed to society.I support the work of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  I welcome the appointment by the Government of Deputy Hoctor as Minister of State with special responsibility for services for older people.  The Minister of State has demonstrated her commitment to working in that role to help older people.  There is a vibrant community of active retirement groups in my constituency of Dublin South-East.  For example, the Ringsend active retirement group does endless work to build on the supports which are provided by the Government.  This Bill will extend the duration of the €18 fuel allowance season by one week, to 30 weeks, which will benefit older people and those who are less mobile or housebound.  The extension of the fuel allowance season is welcome at a time when we are experiencing a more unpredictable climate.  As the percentage of the population over the age of 65 will increase rapidly over the next two decades, it will be more and more vital to continue to protect older people.As Deputy Cyprian Brady said, this year's budget recognises the importance of the input of carers, who contribute a great deal to society in a quiet and understated way.  They work hard in difficult circumstances without always receiving the recognition they deserve.  I am pleased to welcome the increase of up to €14 per week in the rate of payment for all carers.  The earnings threshold for carer's benefit will increase by €12.50 per week, to €332.50, which is to be welcomed.  Carers are critical for the support of older people, persons with disabilities and those with long-term illnesses.  The recent improvements in the carer's schemes mean that 34,000 carers will receive carer's benefit or carer's allowance.The respite care grant is to be increased to €1,700 from next June.  The recognition of carers is a priority for the Government.  It can be emotionally and financially difficult to care for someone who needs long-term care.  It is vital that carers are given as much support and recognition as possible.  Many areas and groups deserve extra financial support.  It is not always possible to achieve all our targets immediately.  The Government will have to make difficult choices when it prioritises key areas in the medium and long terms.  Significant resources will be used to protect the weakest and most vulnerable people in society under the recent budget and this legislation.  As an aunt of mine says, a good start is half the work.  This Bill represents a good start in implementing a five-year strategy.  It will ensure that our recent economic growth is used in a sustainable and socially responsible manner.	spk_372

Today, the Dáil will complete approval of the EU force within the special triple lock mechanism, with Cabinet and UN approval already secured.During the debate on the motion in October, the House heard an array of statistics on Chad and its neighbour, the Central African Republic.  Chad suffers from severe economic challenges and low life expectancy rates.  For instance, it is unlikely Deputy Mulcahy or I would be alive if we were in a similar forum in Chad.  It is in an extremely tense geopolitical and security situation.Since the first motion was moved, I was a member of a Council of Europe election observation mission to Kosovo for the parliamentary elections held on 17 November and I witnessed at first hand the incredible work being carried out by the Army.  I met Brigadier General Gerry Hegarty, commander of the KFOR multinational task force centre, a military regional area that includes the capital, Pristina.That the Army was the first to take command of this area indicates the high regard in which Irish troops are held.  They have long experience in peacekeeping missions, a fact recognised by other nations.  I was proud of each Irish soldier in Kosovo, seeing how professional and efficient they are.  They act as ambassadors for our country, contributing directly to improving the lives of many in what is a very difficult political situation on Europe's doorstep.Captain Deirdre O'Rourke of the bomb disposal unit gave the mission a briefing on the dangers of unexploded mortars and landmines.  The mission was impressed with her knowledge and experience.Witnessing the work of an overseas peacekeeping mission highlighted to me the importance of increasing civil and military co-operation.  In many cases, the army is the first point of contact between the local populations and the international community.  Armies have invaluable on-the-ground knowledge of local terrains and cultures.  Often they have higher capabilities and resources than other agencies.While the Army's core competency may not be deemed to be the so-called softer side of peacekeeping, such as institution-building, building schools and working to improve local economies, it is experienced in this kind of work and is well placed to do more of it.It does not want to, nor should it, dramatically increase its humanitarian role in these regions.  The amount of funding it receives for development should be substantially increased.  Will the Minister ask Irish Aid, which does much invaluable work overseas, to strengthen its relationship with the Army?  The Finnish army in Kosovo has much more funding for community development programmes than the Irish Army.  This engenders a certain amount of goodwill for the Army which will be the first point of contact before many of the NGOs so we should consider it seriously and give more money to the Army in Chad.  Irish Aid should identify community projects there on which the Army could work with the NGOs with increased funding.  Irish Aid and the NGOs working on their behalf would benefit from the goodwill created by the Army because this will ensure a better outcome in countries which have not had the advantage of developing as quickly as we have.  The Army operates efficiently in a structured way when it delivers aid and works with communities, ensuring value for money, which is important.The political situation in Kosovo is tense as 10 December looms but I support the despatch of Irish forces working to improve the stability and future of such areas because it stabilises them.  It has worked in Kosovo and will work in Chad.  As a wealthy nation we have a responsibility to be involved in missions such as this one.The mission to Chad is dangerous because heavy fighting was reported last week between the Chadian army and rebel forces.  French participation in this mission is fraught with danger and creates difficulties, of which the Minister is aware but it has benefits too and we should not get bogged down in the difficulties.  Logistical difficulties must be resolved and the Minister has been active in this work.  Chad is bigger than the UK, Spain, France and Germany put together so it is vital that the troops have sufficient resources.  This should not, however, deflect from Irish commitment to the peacekeeping force.  The Irish role includes the establishment of a safe and secure environment that will facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and will enable humanitarian staff to carry out their work.  I support the despatch of Irish Defence Forces on this mission and wish them every success under the able leadership of Lieutenant General Pat Nash.	spk_409
Chris Andrews	32	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-11-21	dail	30	Young People: Motion (Resumed). 	dbsect_23	I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for sharing time.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important issue.  It is safe to point out that we were all young once, even if some people got older quicker.  In recent years, Fianna Fáil-led Governments have placed great emphasis on the role of young people in society, as evidenced in the establishment of the first Ombudsman for Children in 2004 and the Office of the Minister for Children in 2005 as well as the development and implementation of the national children's strategy.  That a motion on young people is being discussed in the House is testament to the priority the Government attaches to the issue.One cannot deny that we have experienced major economic and sociological changes.  The society in which my two young daughters are growing up differs greatly from that in which I grew up.  Although it offers many more opportunities, it also presents greater challenges.  On a recent international flight I encountered a team of young Irish basketball players travelling to Hungary.  At 15 or 16 years of age, my peers and I were fortunate to travel to County Kerry.  While it is good that young people have greater opportunities and more freedom, they also face greater dangers and must shoulder much more responsibility.  Helping them to cope with this sense of responsibility is the biggest challenge we face.Society will always face challenges.  Deputies referred to issues such as obesity, bullying, drug, alcohol and tobacco abuse and mental health problems.  I urge the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Jimmy Devins, to continue to take a proactive approach in the area of mental health.  I am particularly concerned with the difficulties we are experiencing in addressing eating disorders, which affect young people most.  All Members have a responsibility to raise awareness of this problem and strive to address it.Sexual health is another problem, as is the need to address the effects of technology such as the Internet and mobile telephones.  While these can have positive impacts in terms of education, for example, the use of search engines such as Google, they can also have negative impacts, as is evident in the phenomenon of cyber-bullying.One of the best ways to deal with many of the challenges facing young people is through physical activity and sports promotion.  Being involved in sport helps young people to be physically and mentally healthy, while being on a team gives them a sense of belonging.  It makes a big difference to take part in sport and be part of a team.  They flower through the activity and relax and enjoy themselves.  I know the Minister of State was hugely supportive of sport in his previous role.  This must continue.  Investment in sport is an investment in society and health.  We must ensure we continue to develop sports facilities to meet the ever increasing need for them.The biggest consultation of children, which took place through a ballot organised by the Ombudsman for Children, found that family and care emerged as the most important issues for them.  Society may have changed in some ways since I was a child, but the importance of family and care remains central to both young people and society.	spk_285
Chris Andrews	31	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-11-06	dail	30	Schools Building Projects.	dbsect_24	I am delighted with the opportunity to speak on this issue, which is important not only to society but also to the health system.  A delicate situation has arisen involving the Health Service Executive and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU.  On 14 October, up to 140 pharmacists withdrew methadone services from approximately 3,000 patients as a protest against the changes due to come into force on 1 December 2007.  A pharmacy is currently paid the cost price of the drugs under the general medical card scheme in addition to a fee of €3.26.  There is no mark-up on the cost of these medicines and all the costs of operating the pharmacies' GMS medications are paid for from the €3.26.  It has been said the pharmacists receive fees of up to €18 on occasion, as indicated recently by the Minister, but three out of every four chemists to whom I have spoken claim they never received this payment.  One chemist indicated today that he has been in business for 15 years but has never received it.In practice, the GMS scheme is loss making for the pharmacy but is cross-subsidised by other products.  From 1 December, the HSE intends to pay pharmacies 8% less than the cost price of the medicines.  Pharmacists have described this as a breach of their contract with the HSE.  Drugs payment scheme customers will also be affected because the HSE said it no longer intends to pay pharmacies based on the cost price of medicine.The pharmacists have been more than willing to negotiate, they have come to the table with a very open mind and are willing to discuss virtually any issue with the HSE.  In February 2007, the Minister for Health and Children and the chief executive of the HSE both indicated the need for an independent process for the setting of pharmacy fees.  Discussions were held under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Bill Shipsey but he has since suspended his efforts to find a resolution.  We are thus in limbo and will end up with two unhappy parties and a crisis on 1 December.I understand Mr. Shipsey met the IPU and HSE representatives last Wednesday but nothing has happened since.  It appears to me, having spoken to pharmacists around the country, that the process is really only a smokescreen and that the HSE will continue to force through its proposals without any really meaningful talks.  The HSE has argued that the IPU, as a collection of business undertakings, is precluded under the Competition Act 2002 from negotiating fee-related matters with the HSE.  It is not in a position to negotiate directly with the IPU.  I accept that the HSE has difficulties but do not accept the complete lack of flexibility regarding its unwillingness to discuss the issue with local pharmacists.  It will not engage with the pharmacists as a group or as individuals and this is very unfair.Pharmacists provide a vital service to the community and work long hours.  In many ways, they represent the last bastion of local retail outlets and are genuinely local.  More often than not, they are involved in the local community and provide what the old corner shops used to provide some years ago, namely, a means of interaction with members of the community.  Pharmacies are now part of the social infrastructure and provide medicine to GMS scheme patients and those who are eligible under the drugs payment scheme.  They provide this service on behalf of the HSE and this should be recognised rather than punished.It is simply not realistic to demand that pharmacists dispense medicine at a loss.  In many cases, they are small businesses with high overheads and must compete with new entrants to the market.  A pharmacy with a high GMS turnover will be particularly affected if the proposed change comes about.  Pharmacies should be supported and, in order to increase competition, pressure should be put on the wholesalers rather than the retailers.  The HSE has not been able to negotiate sufficiently good terms with the wholesalers but the retailers and customers should not suffer as a consequence.The HSE has not carried out an economic assessment of its proposals on the retail sector or heeded the recommendations of the Indecon report, which recommended consultation and dialogue.  Why has the report not been published?  I ask that this be done as soon as possible.  It is not enough to hide behind the Competition Act 2002 and it is imperative that the HSE and IPU, on behalf of small pharmacists and those with a high GMS turnover, find a way to reach a mutually beneficial conclusion that avoids further action and does not put patients in further danger.	spk_306

Chris Andrews	31	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-10-25	dail	30	Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007: Second Stage. 	dbsect_12	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak.  As a parent of two young girls I, like every other parent, have hopes and dreams for them.  When people become involved in trafficking, they are not only destroying the hopes and dreams of the parents but the innocent hopes and dreams of the child concerned whose life is likely to become a horror story.  It is important to end trafficking.  Life is hard enough for everybody without us allowing dreams to be smashed before lives even start.  The recent arrest of traffickers in Holland, Spain, Belgium, Britain, the United States and Ireland is very welcome.  It is important to acknowledge the commitment and effectiveness of those who worked to effect those arrests.  It must be one of the most difficult jobs within the Garda Síochána.  I also acknowledge, as previous speakers have done, the contribution of Ruhama, an organisation which supports the victims of violence against women.  Its workload is increasing.  I urge that supports for it should increase in keeping with its increased workload.Human trafficking is one of the greatest scourges in society and becoming increasingly apparent.  It is defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of people for the purpose of exploitation.  In other words, it is modern day slavery.  Many of us would have thought that slavery was long gone.  Abraham Lincoln abolished it in America in 1865.  Great Britain recently marked the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery this year.  Unfortunately — judging from the debate people are saddened by the fact — slavery remains a real and modern phenomenon.  Human trafficking is a global industry.  It is estimated that anywhere between 700,000 and 4 million women and children are trafficked every year.  It is difficult to obtain exact figures, as many cases go under the radar.  These figures serve to remind us of the negative impact of globalisation.  However, it has also had major positive impacts which people recognise.  One of the negative results is increased human trafficking.  While it is easier to carry out financial business transactions across the globe, unfortunately, it is also easier to buy and sell people.Ireland is not immune to this phenomenon.  Human trafficking represents one of the worst violations of human rights, the right to freedom.  What most of us take for granted every day is systematically abused for millions all over the world.  That is why I welcome the publication of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill, the aim of which, to use the words of the Minister, is to make Ireland a more hostile environment for those who might consider trafficking people here.  It criminalises the trafficking of persons for the specific purpose of the trafficked person's sexual or labour exploitation or removal of his or her organs or for any reason.  It applies to the trafficking of both adults and children.This legislation will serve to bring Irish law into line with European and international standards.  The offences as outlined in the Bill are in line with the European Union Framework Decision on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, which supplements the United Nations Convention Against International Organised Crime and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.  The prohibition of the sale of children for the purpose of exploitation is a requirement of the optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.Not only are we acting to bring domestic legislation into line with international standards, the Bill is also part of a much broader strategy.  I compliment the Minister on not dealing with this matter in isolation but on looking at that broad strategy.  He has announced a new high level group on combating trafficking in human beings, an initiative I very much welcome.  This group will draft a national action plan which will allow Ireland to deal with the broader issues and enable the relevant administrative structures to be put in place.I also welcome the initiative being taken by the Minister on a European level.  We will be taking the lead and hosting an international meeting in Dublin early next year.  We are part of the European G6 initiative involving six member states, the aim of which is to make human trafficking less attractive to potential criminals, to create a hostile environment for them.  To use an old cliché which is very accurate on this occasion, prevention is better than cure.  This represents a proactive and co-operative approach to an interstate problem.The Bill is broadly welcomed by many organisations working in the area of trafficking.  Particularly welcome is section 11 which guarantees the anonymity of alleged victims of trafficking, unless the judge fully or partially waives the anonymity in the interests of justice.  Breach of this section could have serious consequences for an alleged victim.  Accordingly, an offence under it will be triable on indictment with a maximum penalty on conviction of an unlimited fine and-or ten years imprisonment.  However, it is imperative that the rights of the victims continue to be protected.There are four separate aspects to trafficking in persons, one which is the criminal law.  The second includes immigration issues which will be dealt with in the forthcoming Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  The third is the protection of victims of trafficking and the provision of services for them while they remain in the country.  The fourth is Garda operations and international co-operation with other police forces and agencies to deal with this type of criminality.  I urge the relevant parliamentary committees — I hope to be particularly active on and involved with those committees — to keep in mind the rights of victims in every aspect and at every stage of each Bill and initiative.  It is the human rights of victims of trafficking that we, as legislators, are aiming to protect.  Victims of trafficking have no voice.  They will have experienced traumatic events and will often not be in a position to defend and advocate for themselves.  At a time when the rights of victims and their relatives are top of the agenda, I urge that the rights of those without a voice be prioritised and that the legislation provide the necessary support and protection.  The Minister has prioritised this issue, which I very much welcome.	spk_208

He is obviously conscious of the difficulties being created by the waste water treatment plant in Ringsend, which cost €300 million to construct.  I am not convinced by claims that the plant has delivered an improvement in water quality around Sandymount and Dublin Bay.  Those who walk along the strand, from the Tara Towers up to the Poolbeg Peninsula, will have noted what appears to be a serious rat infestation in the area.  I am not keen to bring children to the area and having visited the strand a couple of times over the summer, I decided not to return such was the number of rats.  I am not convinced the plant has provided a panacea for the poor quality of water in the area.An e-mail sent to me recently by residents in the Sandymount area states:As you will be aware the odour from the sewage plant has been a major imposition on the residents of much of Dublin South East for the past few years.  We have taken up this matter with Matt Twomey Assistant City Manager and were assured that the problem would be solved by late November by installing a higher quality of dryers and covers on the sewage tanks.  Two weeks ago we wrote to Mr Twomey to ask him if the installation of the dryers was on schedule (we had been told in July that the first of three dryers would be installed in August, another in October and the last in November). The reply received last week informed us that these improvements will now not be in place until some time in 2008. No target date in 2008 was given.The odour on Friday night last (Oct.12) was the most vile and noxious to date. It was so bad in our area that my wife thought that there was a gas leak!  Given the amount of time that the City Council have had to date to fix this problem and the fact that they cannot now even keep to their own remedy schedule we believe that it is now time for the government to intervene.Before his appointment, the Minister, referring to problems with the plant, called on the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ""conduct its own investigation and reveal who is responsible for this cock-up"".  I appreciate, therefore, that he understands the gravity of the situation.  Around this time last year, the Minister also asked when someone would be held accountable for the problem.  It appears no one will be held to account for this engineering and public relations disaster by Dublin City Council, which has affected the quality of life of people living in the area.

My office has tried to contact Dublin City Council in recent days but to no avail.  Why would a member of the public bother his or her backside to contact the council when public representatives are unable to do so?The Minister must ensure someone is held to account and made to pay for three years of failed attempts to control the odours emanating from the Ringsend plant.  Why could the original contractors not fix the problem?  Dublin City Council wants to increase the size of the plant while developing the Poolbeg area.  While efforts to address the odour have resulted in some improvement, the problem is not nearly solved and the issue must be addressed as a matter of urgency.I appreciate the Minister is precluded from discussing many issues affecting our constituency.

This is an important time for Ireland and its role within Europe.  The treaty is being finalised at the intergovernmental conference which convened at the end of July and which will conclude at the end of this week if political agreement is reached.  I support the implementation of the reform treaty and continued and open debate on the future of the European Union.  I welcome the Forum on Europe's contribution and the European Movement Ireland's publications, which are particularly easy to read and should be recommended as a starting point to anyone with an interest in the treaty.After the Nice treaty was signed off in June 2001, it was agreed that a further treaty was necessary to reform voting procedures, improve democracy and transparency and accommodate the new member states.  With this in mind the EU constitution was agreed in 2004 under the aegis of the Irish Presidency.  Negotiations were tough and it was one of the Taoiseach's finest achievements on the international stage.  The constitution was subsequently ratified by 15 member states but was rejected by the Netherlands and France.  As unanimity was required, the constitution was temporarily shelved and a period of reflection entered into throughout 2006.In 2007, under the new German Presidency and with a changed political landscape, the debate was reignited and agreement was successfully negotiated into what has been rebranded the reform treaty.  The statements in the Dáil give us a chance to kick-start the debate on that treaty and the future of the European Union.The lack of debate is one of the major problems of the European Union.  There is a lack of engagement and a perception by the public that they are not part of the decision-making process.  This is evident from the rejection of the EU constitution by two of its founding members in 2005, seen by many as a serious setback for the engine of European integration.  How can citizens vote for change and new treaties if the message is not properly portrayed and they feel excluded from the process?  I hope the debate today and in days to come represents the beginnings of a well informed, well considered and inclusive debate on the future of the European Union, Ireland's role within it and the institutional framework.Since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, we have benefited and contributed a great deal.  We have benefited from the Common Agricultural Policy, Structural Funds and having a common currency.  We have also contributed enormously.  It is widely recognised that the Irish EU Presidency in 2004 was one of the most successful of recent years.  An Irish person, John Bruton, represents the EU as ambassador in Washington and Pat Cox was successful in his role as President of the European Parliament.  Recently Major General Pat Nash was appointed to head the ESDP troops in Chad and the Central African Republic and Commissioner McCreevy, a former Member of this House, is paving the way for the expansion of the Single Market.The history of the European Union is not straightforward.  There has not been linear progression in integration, as many would have us believe, but a series of stops and starts, with periods of deepening and widening, reflection and scepticism.  This is part of the process and is the reason I urge constructive and public debate on the matter.  The reform treaty provides clarity on many institutional issues and will encourage the smooth working of the super-national institutions.  It has excluded specific reference to state-like symbols, which were deemed unpopular, such as a flag, an anthem and a motto.  The reform treaty has accounted for the concerns of Poland by delaying the new voting procedures until 2014 and it has provided an opt-out clause for the justice provisions of the treaty for Britain and Ireland.The opt-out clause does not represent Euroscepticism.  Fine Gael is saying that for the sake of it.  The opt-out clause recognises the need to preserve the common travel area between Britain and Ireland and the fact that the common law system is different from the continental civil law system.  The Cabinet that decided to avail of the opt-out clause has also committed to opting in if conditions in future are suitable.  Ireland will not opt out from the charter of fundamental human rights.  Europe has been a source of prosperity and justice in Ireland.  I welcome the reform treaty and feel it will keep the European project on track, hopefully improving the democratic credentials of European institutions.I have some concerns about the future of European enlargement.  One of the largest EU projects under way is the accession of Turkey.  The enlargement project has been relatively successful so far, with the accession of ten new states in 2004 being smooth, although the success of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007 is still a matter of debate.I am deeply concerned, however, about events in Washington last week.  On Thursday, 11 October, the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee voted 27 to 12 in favour of recognising that the killing of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottomans in 1915 was genocide.  So far, 15 other states have officially recognised the Armenian genocide, including France.  The Turkish responded by recalling their envoy from Washington.  This is a calculated and intimidating move that flies in the face of the liberal image Turkey would like to project.The infamous article 301 of Turkey's penal code prohibits any insults to Turkishness.  The new Turkish President and Prime Minister like to give the impression of being modern and open, but their actions are far removed from their fine words.  Turkey's aggressive stance towards Greek Cyprus is another example of the country's actions not matching its words.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, should express his concerns to Turkish Prime Minister, Mr. Erdogan, as well as urging the newly elected President, Abdullah Gul, to reconsider his response to the recent vote by a committee of the US House of Representatives.Turkey must repeal article 301 to allow freedom of speech and increased protection of human rights.  Without these measures being taken, I am concerned, as are many others, that the European Union will drop the bar for admission to the Union, thus diminishing the values and benefits of EU membership.  There appears to be a debate between academics and Eurocrats about further expansion of Europe.  It appears that they carry on this debate with little reference to the broader European public.  These Eurocrats have deemed that further rapid expansion is, like medicine, good for us regardless of whether we like it.  The difficulty is that these Eurocrats have left an ever-increasing number of people behind.Today, many politicians and Eurocrats seem to measure the success of the European project by the number of countries striving not only for association and political partnership within Europe, but also for full EU membership.  Admittedly, it is encouraging to see that the EU is perceived by the outside world as a model organisation.  However, the EU's interior political landscape and the general mood of European political opinion suggest that it would be courageous to acknowledge that the EU needs to refocus on serving the well-being of its citizens instead of leading an ongoing debate on important issues such as enlargement over the heads of the public.  These professional Eurocrats should consider the impact deficiencies in the EU's democratic system has on Europe's credibility at home, as opposed to focusing primarily on the devastating effects that refusal may have for new applicants.  The public should decide Europe's future.  Without constructive engagement and debate on this matter, the reform treaty will not be worth the paper it is written on.  I look forward to engaging in that debate and I hope the reform treaty will be adopted.	spk_337

Chris Andrews	31	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-10-10	dail	30	Charities Bill 2007: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_28	"I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, on introducing this Bill and on his promotion.  He will be good for communities around Dublin and he has certainly been good to Finglas.  I am glad there was sufficient foresight to share him with the rest of the country.  I also congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael Kitt, on his promotion.  He has challenging times ahead but he has certainly set off in the right direction.I welcome this legislation, which has been in the pipeline for a long time.  Much preparation and consultation has been carried out with the various stakeholders and I am delighted to see it includes many important proposals concerning the organisation of charities.  Charity work in Ireland has a long history and many charities, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, originated in the 1800s.  A number of Irish charities, including Trócaire, GOAL, Gorta and Concern, almost enjoy global status and I commend them on their hard work and success.There is a proliferation of small local voluntary organisations.  I read today that up to 63,000 people are employed in this sector in Ireland, both on a part-time and full-time basis.  In my constituency, Dublin South-East, a local group from the Grand Canal area, which is not too far from here, set up a committee to raise money for a special care unit for babies and recently presented a cheque for €34,000 to the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street.  This is a great example of the civic-mindedness, generosity and teamwork that exists at community level in every town and village in Ireland.On foot of our long-standing tradition of charitable work, it is incumbent on the Government not only to provide relevant supports where appropriate, but also to provide a clear and stable regulatory framework for this growing field of work.  I am delighted the Charities Bill will do this and make it easier for volunteers to become involved in charity work in the future.As already outlined, key aspects of the Bill include the definition of ""charitable purpose"", a new regulatory authority, a register of charities, an annual activity report by charities to the new authority, a charity appeals tribunal and dissolution of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.This Bill represents the Government's commitment to modernising the charity sector.  Everybody will agree that an element of modernising is required.  The Bill, together with the Charities Acts 1961 and 1973, will put in place a composite regulatory framework for charities.  Having contacted representatives of a number of charities to discuss the legislation with them, I assure the House that it has been broadly welcomed.  Most importantly, the Bill will serve to improve the public perception of charities.  A certain degree of cynicism about charities has developed over the years, possibly as a result of changed methods of collection, such as what I call plastic bag collections.  When plastic bags are posted through our letterboxes, the implication is that the clothes put in them will go to charities.  The bags are sometimes associated with businesses which have very little connection with charity.  I hope this Bill will clear up many of the negative feelings about charities which are inspired by such operations.  I accept that many legitimate charities operate in this manner, but businesses which imply they are charities are causing problems.This Bill will regulate against fraud and make it easier for charities to become established.  It allows for new fundraising methods, such as collection of promises of money by means of direct debit, to be used.  Those of us who walk through the city centre on a regular basis are familiar with the so-called ""chuggers"", or ""charity muggers"".  I am not comfortable with this type of collection by charities because its professional nature just does not feel right.  While I do not like it — it is almost aggressive at times — I accept that a case can be made for it.I would like to discuss two specific aspects of the Bill — the charities regulator and the definition of ""charitable purpose"".  It is proposed that a charities regulatory authority be established to act as an independent regulatory body for the charities sector.  The principal role of the authority will be to increase public confidence in charities through effective oversight of such organisations, to encourage better administration of charitable trusts and to provide guidance to charitable organisations, including through the development of codes of practice, which are extremely important.  The authority will also have the power to institute investigations, call for documents, search for records, impose sanctions and enforce penalties.  While it is important that there is a carrot, there also needs to be a stick.The authority will act as an excellent point of reference and support in overseeing the charities sector as a whole.  I would like to put forward some suggestions for consideration, however.  I agree with some speakers that we should be concerned about how the authority is run and who will run it.  Such matters will be teased out on Committee Stage.  If I had a choice, my preference would be for the authority to be run in-house.  The regulator should strengthen its independence.  We should bear in mind the costs of regulation and the burden of compliance costs, particularly for smaller organisations.  We cannot afford to impede the work of organisations like the one I mentioned in the Grand Canal Street area, which organises a fund for Holles Street Hospital.  We have to keep it simple and workable.  While the charities sector has become more professional, we do not want it to become over-managed.  We do not want regulation simply for the sake of it — we want effective regulation that will protect charities and donors.  I would like the regulator to be established as soon as possible — the sooner the better for everybody involvedI would also like to comment on the Bill's proposed definition of ""charitable purpose"".  I welcome the inclusion in this Bill of a definition, as it had previously been a matter solely for the Revenue Commissioners.  It has to be a good thing that ""charitable purpose"" is to be fully defined in primary legislation for the first time.  Section 3(1) of the Bill defines each of the following as a ""charitable purpose"":((((Like many representatives of charities and non-governmental organisations, I am concerned that the promotion of human rights is not explicitly mentioned in this definition, particularly in an age in which human rights abuses are reported in newspapers on a daily basis.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, to consider on Committee Stage the inclusion of a reference to ""human rights"" in the definition.  I will certainly support such a move on his part.Given that human rights are being abused in places like Burma, Darfur, Iraq and North Korea, it is vital that we protect charities which try to promote and protect human rights at home and abroad.  Having signed up to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and many other international human rights treaties, Ireland should reflect its human rights policies in primary legislation.  If it can be done in Scottish and English legislation, why can it not be done in Irish legislation?  The protection of animal rights is mentioned in the Bill, but human rights are not.  I would like to seek clarification on this point.  I ask the Minister to address it.We need to support, rather than discourage, spontaneous community fundraising.  There is uncertainty about the implications of the Bill for people who organise or take part in such fundraising in response to disasters such as the tsunami crisis of 2004.  As I understand it, all charitable groups of all sizes will have to register with the proposed charities regulatory authority.  I am concerned that this provision could act as a deterrent to fundraising.  This legislation does not clearly set out the requirements or exceptions which will apply to permits in the case of exceptional one-off community responses to urgent needs.  If this matter is not clarified, people might not be willing to organise such responses because they might be afraid of falling foul of the law, which would be a terrible additional consequence for those who have already been affected by tragedy.  This aspect of the Bill should be considered further on Committee Stage and exemptions should be made for local, short-term collections.I welcome the Charities Bill 2007, which will put in place a much-needed framework for the organisation of charitable services in Ireland.  While that framework may need to be examined further, it is pleasing that the Bill recognises the long-standing and ever-growing tradition of voluntary work in Ireland.  This legislation will increase public confidence in charities and protect charities and donors.  We have to safeguard the independence and strength of the proposed charities regulatory authority.  We need to revise the Bill's definition of ""charitable purpose"" to include a reference to ""human rights"".  We should ensure we do not deter those who wish to engage in spontaneous fundraising such as that carried out to raise funds for the Giraffe incubator, to which I alluded earlier.  We also need to consider the role of voluntary advocacy groups."	spk_390
Chris Andrews	31	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-10-10	dail	30	Fire Services.	dbsect_37	A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on an issue of great importance both for the implementation of the national health strategy and for the provision of health care services in the constituency of Dublin South-East.  First, I would like to focus on the facilities provided in St. Luke's Hospital in Rathgar.  As residents and patients alike know, plans have been under way since July 2005 to transfer the oncology services of St. Luke's Hospital to a centre of excellence in St. James's Hospital.  This decision was taken by the Minister based on the report, The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland.The decision was designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care including surgery and medical oncology.  What this means in plain language is that cancer patients will receive all the treatment they need under the one roof, experts will be available in the one location, and all available technology and services will be on site.  It is known as multidisciplinary care and it makes sense.  It is in line with international best practice and it has been proven that patients have a 20% higher chance of survival if they are treated in specialist centres.  Patient survival is the objective of health care strategy and I therefore welcome the initiative.Members of the board of St. Luke's Hospital have also fully committed to supporting this decision.  They recognise that it is in line with international best practice and is designed to ensure optimal outcomes for patients.  They are fully behind it.  They have also ensured that the expertise and ethos of St. Luke's will be at the heart of the new arrangement in St. James's Hospital.However, two major points need further consideration in this debate.  First, there is a chronic shortage of step-down facilities in Dublin South-East and second, the site of St. Luke's is a unique place for respite and palliative care.  It provides a calm and tranquil setting in which to recuperate and undergo serious health treatment.  This should not be ignored.  Anybody who has been there will know there is a special quality about St. Luke's.	spk_459

It may seem odd that new services are being provided in a centre whose cancer services are to be transferred.  However, the reason for this is to ensure the quality of service to cancer patients during the years that it will take to complete the transfer.

Chris Andrews	31	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-10-09	dail	30	Proposed EU Military Operation: Motion. 	dbsect_22	I wish to share time with Deputy Michael Mulcahy.This motion seeks approval for the dispatch of Major General Pat Nash to the position of operations commander for the proposed EU military operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic, an issue in which I have an interest.  Like many people in Ireland, I have an interest in issues of conflict across the globe.  This probably stems from the time I worked in Nicaragua in solidarity with the Sandinistas in the 1980s.  They had overthrown the corrupt Somoza in 1979.  In that conflict, the US funded the opposition which, ultimately, overthrew the democratic government.Since that conflict I always feel a huge sense of disappointment when I see foreign troops on another country's soil.  It rarely has long-term positive effects.  My gut instinct is that however bad things become in a divided country, it is best to let the different sides determine their own future.  However, to refuse to send peacekeepers to countries like Chad and the Central African Republic would be like passing by while an elderly person is mugged on the streets.  As the Minister said, we must step up to the plate.  This is a very wealthy country.  However, I say with a certain amount of reluctance that this is the right thing to do.This is a serious intervention which I do not believe anybody can dispute.  The appointment of Major General Pat Nash is a sign of how seriously we take this issue.  The situation in Chad is very serious.  It has a population of 10 million and, as previous speakers mentioned, there are 280,000 refugees and approximately 180,000 internally displaced people.  Life expectancy is approximately 43 years of age.  Dealing with this is a fairly bleak prospect for any country or force.We must also show that the international community and this force takes the opposition, particularly in Chad, seriously.  President Deby recently changed the constitution to suit himself and his supporters.  This led to inevitable violence.  Such violence is only to be expected when people make such changes to suit themselves.  It is no coincidence that the constitutional change coincided with the dramatic increase in revenue from the new found oil reserves.  With the arrival of oil and US investment, there would be a concern that our new found interest is oil-related.  We must really work hard to ensure this impression is not accurate.This force is composed of many nations, with France as the core nation.  However, given the colonial past, the French may not be perceived as honest brokers.  I am concerned that may cast a shadow over the entire force.  Rebels and the opposition may perceive the force as an aggressive unit as I believe French soldiers prevented the capture of the capital by the opposition.  French participation may contaminate the force and this must be borne in mind in any future negotiations.Libya, a country seen as an international pariah for a long time, has been quite involved in progressing peace in this region and it is important to acknowledge that point.  Another concern we must have is the close proximity of Chad and the Central African Republic to Darfur.  Previous speakers mentioned it has 280,000 refugees and over 180,000 internally displaced people.  This makes the situation even more complicated.  I understand fighting has gone through a lull over the past number of months because of the ongoing negotiations and the rainy season which meant military operations were not easy to carry out.  The rainy season is over and it is likely there will be increasing pressure for further military action from both sides.This is not only a great honour for Major General Pat Nash but also for our armed forces which have served around the world with distinction.  Despite concerns over French domination of the force and worries over what could be perceived as western intervention, I have no doubt the contribution of an Irish operations commander will facilitate the smooth running of the one-year mission in a region with dire humanitarian security needs.	spk_181

Chris Andrews	31	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-10-04	dail	30	Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007: Second Stage (Resumed). 	dbsect_5	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak in support of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007.  It is not the most exciting of titles or Bills but it is a very important Bill.  While I do not have a technical background in financial services I am speaking on the Bill because I recognise the importance of the financial services industry in Ireland and the benefit that European legislation has brought in terms of stability and competitiveness in the market.Recent events, referred to by the previous speaker, such as the run on Northern Rock and the faltering of the US sub-prime market, have reminded us all of the importance of good regulation.  It is important we do not have regulation for the sake of it but regulation which benefits the consumer and the economy on the whole.  The previous speaker mentioned vigilance and the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007 is about continuing vigilance.  As markets change it is important that legislation changes to meet the various challenges.This Bill has not come out of a puff of air but is part of a much broader picture.  In 1999 the financial services action plan was created at European level and I am glad to say Irish representatives played a very active role in its creation.  The action plan aims to create a single market for financial services.  The prospectus directive and market abuse directives, which came into force in July 2005, have already brought great benefit to the Irish financial services industry.  The transparency directive was introduced earlier this year and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) 2004/39/EC is due to come into force across the EU on 1 November.What sounds like jargon dreamt up by bureaucrats and legislators will actually serve to make our economy more robust and competitive, less vulnerable to fraud and more attractive to foreign investors.  The final step in the process is to introduce the primary legislation to ensure the MiFID can function effectively within the Irish system.  I am happy to say that Ireland was one of the first member states to transpose the directive, in February this year.  I am also happy that we are preparing for the deadline of 1 November by applying the requisite provisions.The Bill stipulates that a person guilty of an offence under section 5 will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding €10 million, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both.  These measures have involved consultation with the relevant stakeholders and aim to ensure the directive will be implemented in the most effective way possible.A further provision affecting Irish law is the repeal of the Stock Exchange Act 1995.  I congratulate the Minister for streamlining and, where appropriate, retiring legislation to enable the legal system to run more smoothly and cost-effectively.  The financial services industry is a large employer in Dublin South-East and I very much welcome this Bill, which will serve to keep the cogs of the financial machine turning.  It will bring transparency and accountability where it is needed.	spk_150

Chris Andrews	31	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-09-27	dail	30	Cancer Services: Motion (Resumed). 	dbsect_5	I am sure they were delighted.  It is a difficult issue.  The delivery of cancer treatment and radiotherapy services has been a priority for this Government and will continue to be so, which I certainly welcome.Along with heart disease, cancer, as Deputy Calleary noted, affects almost everybody and scares people.  Across Dublin, including Dublin South-East, people are being diagnosed and have family members who are being diagnosed with cancer.  It is a huge shock when one receives that diagnosis.Since 1997 and the implementation of the first national cancer strategy, more than €1 billion has been invested in cancer services nationally.  Under the national development plan, this type of continued priority and major investment has continued.  Investment of up to €415 million has been provided for within the new national cancer control strategy to fund the national plan for radiation oncology.Radiotherapy is an integral part of cancer treatment.  It is used for curative and palliative treatment and Government health policy has reflected this.  Only yesterday, eight specialist cancer centres were announced.  They will be located in each of the four HSE areas, will provide treatment services for all forms of cancer and will include radiation oncology services.  Among the new specialist cancer services are two in south Dublin — one in St. Vincent's Hospital and the second in St. James's Hospital.  This is clearly good news for those people in south Dublin and Dublin in general and I very much welcome this development.St. Luke's Hospital was mentioned yesterday in this debate.  It is obviously located in Dublin South-East so I am very aware of the challenges facing it and cancer service delivery.  The primary concern of cancer treatment must be the patient, who must be put first.  My understanding is that treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach.  With many cancers, life-threatening complications can set in which require surgical facilities that are not available at St. Luke's Hospital.  They are available at the main centres and will be available at the facilities in St. James's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital when they come on stream.  Patients' interests are not best served in St. Luke's Hospital.  Perhaps it is not politically correct to say this, but the reality is that we must put the patient first and look past short-term thinking.  In the long term, cancer services from St. Luke's Hospital will be transferred in a planned way where the staff and ethos of the hospital will be transferred.In the short term, urgently needed additional treatment capacity is being introduced at St. Luke's Hospital.  This project is in the build phase with a start date of March 2008.  This capacity will increase St. Luke's Hospital's radiotherapy capacity by 25% and is in addition to the replacement of existing treatment capacity which is reaching the end of its clinical life.  This new replacement capacity represents an investment in excess of €13 million in St. Luke's Hospital.It is a shame that the Opposition is willing to scare people, which is what it is doing.  It is playing on people who are vulnerable, concerned and frightened about what the future holds for them.  It is doing this in the interests of short-term political gain.  That is the reality.

Chris Andrews	31	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-09-27	dail	30	Cancer Services: Motion (Resumed). 	dbsect_5	The Opposition would make the same decision.  It would not send family members to St. Luke's Hospital knowing that better, comprehensive and planned facilities and centres of excellence exist in St. James's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital.  In the future, services will be transferred to St. James's Hospital, which will create an opportunity to provide community and step-down facilities on the grounds of St. Luke's Hospital.I urge the Minister and will demand in time that she give a commitment that St. Luke's Hospital will not be sold off but will instead  be used for community health care.  Improvements and developments are taking place in the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, but there is a huge need for step-down and community care facilities in south Dublin.  It is a core issue that the land and facilities of St. Luke's Hospital are not sold off.  People, with the exception of the Opposition which believes it can score a few political points, generally accept that the transfer of services is in the best interest of patients.I suppose our political views are often shaped by our personal experience.  Like many families around the country who have been visited by cancer, my experience with cancer services has been extremely positive.  I have also met many people who are unhappy with cancer services.  There are gaps and challenges.  Clearly, transportation and the transfer of patients to cancer services are required, but there is no magic wand.  I strongly believe in and support the Minister, not blindly but in a positive and questioning way.  I welcome the continued delivery of services in this country.	spk_83

Chris Andrews	31	Unknown	Dublin Bay South	#ChrisAndrews	2007-09-27	dail	30	Legal Aid Service.	dbsect_25	On 1 August 2007, Derek Cumiskey was killed in Lanzarote.  He had turned 18 years of age two weeks prior to his murder.  He was a well-liked student at St. Augustine's in Blackrock, County Dublin and lived nearby in Townsend Street.  He had just completed his junior certificate and had been selected as student of the year at his school.  He celebrated this achievement by going on holiday to Puerto del Carmen with friends and his sister, Joanne.Since his murder on 1 August, the Cumiskey family has received consular assistance from the consulate in Lanzarote but no legal aid or representation.  As a result, they feel like intruders in the investigative process instead of being kept up-to-date with the investigation.  In September, the investigating judge indicated the process would be kept confidential for a further month and any objections would have to be lodged within three days.  However, the Cumiskey family was not made aware of this development until ten days afterwards.  It should not be beyond us to provide more assistance to families when a loved one dies abroad.According to the CSO the number of trips abroad by Irish citizens between April and June 2007 was 2,048,000, an increase of 12% on the corresponding period in 2006.  People who used to travel once a year are now going abroad two or three times.  The increased incidence of travel has also seen an increase in the number of fatalities of citizens abroad, which puts pressure on the Department of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance in such cases.  When the recent airplane crash in Thailand occurred, it was inevitable Irish holidaymakers would be involved.  I extend my sympathies to the family of Aaron Toland, a young man from Derry.The number of Irish people travelling to the Canary Islands is now higher than the number travelling to the United States.  It is imperative that consular and legal assistance should be improved.  The Cumiskeys would have legal aid if the event had occurred in Ireland but because it took place in another jurisdiction, the family has received no legal briefing other than information from the consulate.  The tragic case of Derek Cumiskey brings into focus the issues faced by those whose family members are murdered abroad.  I understand the number of such cases is small.  My office requested the figures for the number of citizens murdered abroad each year from the Department of Foreign Affairs but I am still awaiting the figures.A reciprocal aid system is already in place in EU member states.  Council directive 2002/8 to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes establishes minimum common rules relating to legal aid.  The issue of legal aid and how Irish citizens access it abroad appears to be very unclear.  Issues need to be addressed as regards two measures by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is not clear which Department is ultimately responsible.  First, if there is a reciprocal arrangement between Ireland and other countries to provide legal supports for those Irish citizens who require it, why did the Cumiskeys and families in similar positions not have this information made available automatically?  Second, if arrangements are not in place to ensure that families of murder victims have the information they need, then clearly a facility or fund needs to be put in place to allow such families access to legal aid when it is required.	spk_529

Fine Gael's motion has less to do with waste management than with political points-scoring.  It will not make any difference to the siting of incinerators anywhere in Dublin or throughout the country.Ringsend has undergone significant change in the past 25 years.  The Poolbeg Peninsula has evolved to a point where it hosts many heavy industries, such as the ESB which is likely to be relocated, port container storage and the sewage treatment plant.  This last was a great project that cleaned the water but unfortunately polluted the air.  As Deputy Quinn and everyone else living around Dublin Bay is aware, the Shelly Banks, traditionally a bathing place, is now known as the ""Smelly Banks"".  This project was a public relations disaster for Dublin City Council, so it is hard to blame people for distrusting or being disappointed with the way the council has dealt with another major infrastructural project.The Poolbeg Peninsula is about to change with residential, office and retail development and the relocation of the port and heavy industry.  It is likely to become a template for good planning, like the Dublin docklands which is a thriving community.  It makes no sense to put infrastructure in an area that is about to become residential.  People accuse residents of not wanting this in their back yards.  I suspect that most of the Fine Gael Members who signed this motion do not know where the yard is.  Anybody who does knows it is full.  Incineration here will be a part of our waste management strategy throughout the country.  Many of the countries with the best environmental records include incineration in their waste management strategies.  We cannot continue to export our waste.Incineration is better than landfill which is a form of land contamination and is unacceptable.  Many houses in Ringsend were built on an old landfill site and residents there believe that the high incidence of cancer in the area is related to the building of homes on a landfill site.  It is no longer acceptable to use landfill.The communities in Ringsend and Sandymount do not need this sort of opportunist motion that attempts to spare the blushes of Fine Gael which has done nothing to oppose the incinerator.
