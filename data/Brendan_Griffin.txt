He served as Deputy Government chief whip from July 2020 to December 2022 and asMinister of State for Tourism and Sportfrom 2017 to 2020.[1][2][3]Political career[edit]Early political career[edit]Griffin is a former member ofKerry County Council, representing theDinglelocal electoral area from 2009 to 2011. He was the subject of controversy for hiring his wife R\u00f3is\u00edn as his secretarial assistant and his brother Tommy Griffin as his parliamentary assistant. Both these positions were filled without interview and have salaries paid for by the state. In addition, Griffin helped another cousin, Matt Griffin, get his old council seat.[4]He takes half of his TD salary, at first giving the other half directly back to the exchequer and then in 2012 donating the other half of his salary to pay for a third teacher, in a small rural Kerry school.[5]Griffin attendedNUI Galway.[6]D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann[edit]In 2011, Griffin was selected on theFine Gaelticket inKerry South, along with incumbent TDTom Sheahan. Griffin topped the poll with 8,808 first preferences votes, over three thousand more than his party colleague who poled 5,674. He was deemed elected toD\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, after Count 5, soon followed byTom FlemingandMichael Healy-Rae.At the2016 general election, Fine Gael had a disappointing result nationally, but Brendan Griffin improved his first-preference vote to 9,674, polling third in the combinedKerryconstituency. This was the highest vote achieved by any Fine Gael candidate inMunster, as well as being the largest vote aYoung Fine Gaelcandidate secured in Ireland.[citation needed]He was returned to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, on the 11th Count, after his government colleaguesJimmy DeenihanandLabour'sArthur Springwere eliminated.Calls for Taoiseach to step down[edit]On 11 July 2016, Brendan Griffin did an interview withRT\u00c9 News: Six Onecalling forTaoiseachEnda Kennyto step down asLeader of Fine Gaelbefore the D\u00e1il returned in September. Griffin was not backed by any other TD and a vote of confidence was not held. Griffin argued that Fine Gael showed a lack of preparedness for an election in the scenario where it arose.Minister of State[edit]Minister for Transport, Tourism and SportShane Rosshad a toxic relationship with his first junior ministerPatrick O'Donovanand whenLeo Varadkartook over as Taoiseach he asked Ross if he wished for a replacement. Griffin was appointed asMinister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with responsibility for Tourism and Sport. In his bookIn Bed with the BlueshirtsRoss says that although they had very different positions, Griffin was a problem-solver and as such they worked well together; \"His natural diplomacy will make him a superb Minister for Foreign Affairs some day\", said Ross.[7]Later political career[edit]At thegeneral election in February 2020, Griffin was again re-elected in Kerry.[8][9]He was appointed asDeputy chief whipon 15 July 2020, and served until December 2022.In 2022, Griffin called for a ban on allSUVsin theDublin Bay Southconstituency, in response to what he described as \"hare-brained proposals\" regarding climate action.[10][11][12]On 31 January 2023, he announced that he would not be contesting thenext general election.[13]References[edit]^\"Brendan Griffin\".Oireachtas Members Database.Archivedfrom the original on 28 March 2019.
