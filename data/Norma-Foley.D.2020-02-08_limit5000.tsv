Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-20	dail	33	Death of Michael O'Regan: Expressions of Sympathy	dbsect_3	"I also would like to be associated with the words of sympathy to the late Michael O'Regan's family and, indeed, to his colleagues in  Michael was much revered, much respected and, indeed, I would say, much loved, particularly in Kerry but, I would feel, far beyond. He was the consummate journalist. He was well researched, well informed and he was impartial. He was incredibly fair. He was a man who was immensely and immeasurably proud of his Kerry credentials and he wore them very much on his sleeve. He certainly carried all things Kerry in his heart and, indeed, in his voice. He had a particularly strong beautiful Kerry accent and all of us who heard it, whether on national radio, national media or whatever, were elevated all the more to think that one of our own was doing so well and had such a distinguished career in the world of journalism.We will miss him greatly in Kerry. He was a great professional in his chosen profession of journalism. More than that, however, he was an honourable and decent man. As already stated, he was very fair and impartial. He was also generous in his time for others and was considerate of others. There is an expression, ""We will not see his like again"", and I am very confident of that. I extend my sympathy to all who knew him and all who loved him. He is gone too soon but his legacy is rich. It was a privilege for all of us who knew him and who spent time with him to be afforded that opportunity. We are the lesser for his passing but greater for having had the privilege of knowing him. May he rest in peace."	spk_28
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_18	"The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, more than 161,600 children, including more than 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post-primary services, 19,800 pupils with special educational needs and 6,800 pupils who arrived to Ireland from Ukraine are transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02 million. There is a facility within the special educational needs transport scheme for the appointment of a school transport escort, where a child’s care and safety needs while on school transport are such as to require the support of a school transport escort. The Department of Education provides grant funding for the employment of the school transport escort and sets the rate of pay. Under the Education Act 1998, the principal and-or board of management are responsible for the operation of the school and is the employer of the school transport escort and therefore responsible for all employment matters relating to its school transport escort. Building Momentum, a new public service agreement for 2021-2022, was agreed between Government and unions in 2020 and was extended to run until the end of 2023. The agreement provides for a number of pay increases over the period of the agreement. This agreement only applies to public servants and does not automatically apply beyond public servants. Therefore, grant-funded school staff such as bus escorts employed directly by schools are not part of the agreement. However, it is recognised that school bus escorts play a vital role in supporting children with special educational needs in their journey to and from school. The school transport section in the Department is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of matters as they relate to bus escorts and the information provided to schools. An information pack for schools is being developed and will be reviewed and updated regularly. As part of this comprehensive review, the terms of employment and rate of pay for school bus escorts are also being examined, and the Department will continue to keep the rates under review. The Department has recently published a national survey of SNAs on 
              The survey, which is anonymous and will remain open until 27 February, will gather information on those SNAs who also work as bus escorts including data on the number of hours worked per week and the number of children they escort to school. The SNA workforce development plan will also include an examination of the interaction of the SNA role with that of bus escort, in the context of an overall review of the SNA role. A review of the school transport scheme has recently been completed by a steering group with high level membership of relevant Government Departments and other bodies, reflecting the importance of the scheme for access to education and other wider Government objectives. The school transport scheme has been in operation for over 55 years, since its establishment in 1967, and this review is one of the most extensive investigations that has been carried out into the scheme since then. Undoubtedly, the school transport scheme is of huge importance to families. The review has been conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and to ensure it services students and their families efficiently and effectively. The review has also given consideration to employment-related matters for school bus escorts. Considering how to best maximise the benefits now and into the future has been a significant factor in the review of the scheme. I am aware that this review is much-awaited. It is recognised that there are improvements which need to be made to the scheme and I know the importance of doing so. I expect to be in a position shortly to bring the review to Government, and, further to Government approval, the review will be published."	spk_242

I will specifically address a number of the issues the Deputy has raised. The school transport section is carrying out a comprehensive review of matters as they relate to bus escorts. The information pack that is being developed will be made available to schools for the beginning of the 2024-25 school year. As part of this review, the terms of employment and rate of pay for school bus escorts are also being examined. The consultation on the SNA workforce development plan is open until 27 February.

Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_18	"While some applicants may not yet have received an offer of a school place for 2024-25, I assure families and all children who require a school place that such a place will be provided for them for the 2024-25 school year. I do not, for one minute, underestimate the challenges and stress families are facing but we are clear that positions will be made available for students for the 2024-25 school year. Since 2020, the Department has invested in the region of €4.3 billion in our schools throughout the country, including investment in the completion of over 800 school building projects. Construction is currently under way on approximately 300 other projects, including 34 new school buildings. It is an absolute priority of the Department to ensure every child in the State has access to a school place that is appropriate to his or her needs and we are continually investing in existing and new schools to ensure this is the case. Testament to this is that in response to demographic growth at post-primary level, school building projects completed in 2023 delivered over 7,000 additional mainstream post-primary school places. School building projects at construction involve an overall State investment of over €1.2 billion. We also have a large modular accommodation programme delivering urgently needed school places. This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s very strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for school communities. This capital investment is underpinned by a robust school planning approach that uses a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity, is utilised for this purpose. In addition, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department’s projections of school place requirements. There are 1 million learners across 4,000 primary and post-primary schools. Based on primary level enrolments, growth in post-primary enrolments is projected to continue in many parts of the country. In addition, due to strong residential construction and planning activity, we can expect to see increasing demand in particular towns and areas.
              In the area of special education, the National Council for Special Education has forecast continued significant growth in the requirements for special classes at post-primary level and my Department is working towards the provision of an average of four special classes in every post-primary school. To meet these requirements, the Department has 450 large-scale and additional school accommodation scheme projects at various stages of planning and delivery at post-primary schools across the country. Furthermore, where a requirement is identified for expedited delivery of additional capacity, my Department utilises modern methods of construction, including its modular accommodation framework, to provide required accommodation. While there can be enrolment pressures in some areas, it is important to note this may sometimes not be a result of a lack of accommodation but may be driven by factors such as the duplication of applications and applications from outside the local area. Notwithstanding this, in some areas there can be an underlying requirement for additional school places. In that context, as part of planning for September 2024, data on applications for admission is being shared with my Department by post-primary schools across areas of enrolment pressure. The sharing of this data has been very effective in the identification of school place requirements. In the majority of areas, through the work of schools, patrons, management bodies and the Department, there are sufficient school places available to meet the needs of children in the area. The Department is working with schools and patrons to make additional places available in areas where a need for more places has been identified."	spk_248
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_18	I am clearly saying to the Deputy that if there are specific cases he needs to bring to the attention of the Department, I will be very happy to deal with them. We in the Department are committed to ensuring that every child has an appropriate place for the 2024-25 school year, whether at primary or post-primary level. With regard to special education provision, we are equally determined to ensure that every child has a place appropriate to his or her needs. The NCSE would tell us that we have successfully achieved that for the 2023-24 school year. We have invested a considerable amount of money up to this point. We have completed more than 800 projects in the lifetime of this Government. There are 300 projects currently at various stages of construction.

We are consistently planning forward. That can be seen in the 300 projects currently under construction, which I have mentioned. That includes brand-new schools and additional accommodation. More than 800 school building projects have been provided for over the past number of years since the present Government was installed. Some €4.3 billion has been expended on school building programmes. We will continue to engage. I have directly engaged with local authorities, as have my officials. We have also engaged with the LDA.

Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_18	The State Examinations Commission is responsible for the operation, delivery and development of the State examinations. The SEC is very aware, as am I as Minister, of the challenges of the timing of the oral examinations for students, parents and education partners. Prior to the pandemic, the oral examinations in any given year were held either before or after the Easter holidays, depending on how early or late Easter fell in that particular year. Following Covid, in 2022, the full oral examinations took place outside of school time over the first week of the Easter holidays. This change in timing was made in response to the need to take steps to limit teacher absences from schools given challenges associated with sourcing substitute teachers. It was intended also to minimise further disruption to teaching and learning in schools and, in particular, for those candidates preparing for their examinations. The SEC was requested to undertake an evaluation of the 2022 experience of holding oral and music practical examinations at Easter to advise me on future implementation. That was at my request. Following preliminary review, the SEC advised that the arrangements that applied in 2022 in respect of oral examinations in Irish and the modern foreign languages should continue for a further year in 2023 pending a more comprehensive evaluation. In 2023, it was possible to deliver these examinations for all candidates within the Easter holiday period due to the positive response to the SEC’s recruitment efforts. I thank all the staff who engaged so positively with that recruitment process to ensure there was a sufficiency of examiners. Nonetheless, the SEC has noted it is aware of the mixed views of stakeholders about the timing of these examinations. In that regard, the SEC progressed a more extensive evaluation to fully assess the impact of holding the oral examinations at Easter. This has included research to explore parent, student, teacher, examiner and school leadership opinions about the timing of these examinations. Following completion of this wider evaluation process, the SEC will provide advice to my Department on the future timing of the leaving certificate oral examinations going forward. In the interim, the SEC considered it preferable to extend the Easter holiday timing for a further year and to mirror the arrangements that applied in 2023 again in 2024. These arrangements include additional resources for school authorities and an Easter premium payable to examiners.	spk_254
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_18	As I have said there is a review ongoing that is being undertaken by the SEC. This was at my request. I acknowledge the huge co-operation. A premium rate has been paid to examiners and there has been additional support provided to schools in days being made available to them to support their work at that time. I acknowledge what the Deputy said that there are mixed views on the timing of it. The SEC has done an interim review and has agreed to do a more comprehensive review, which is under way at present. When that is completed, we will review the information that has been gathered. I have no doubt the SEC will revert with its findings following that review. By arranging the exams in the first week of the Easter holidays, it does provide that examiners, candidates and school staff have a consecutive ten-day break from school after the examinations have been completed. It is important to say that, in line with traditional arrangements, candidates who miss their oral examination due to illness or close family bereavement will be facilitated with a later examination the week commencing 18 May. There is an ongoing flexibility there.	spk_256
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_18	To be fair, the State Examinations Commission's interim report very clearly identified the requirement for additional support being made available to schools to support students for whatever their need might be, from a well-being point of view to additional supports that might be required. As a consequence of that, in this school year school authorities are being provided with five additional examination aide days. The school authorities can appoint a member of staff specifically to provide any type of support that is required to candidates to ensure their attendance and that things are working for them as we would want them to work. This will be separate to the examination aide days provided to facilitate operational and administrative duties associated with the oral exam. The SEC has recommended, and it is being provided for, that there will be an examination aide provided for just the operation and administration of the oral exams but they will specifically provide five additional days to be used in whatever way the school deems fit to support students at that time.	spk_258

The SEC has recommended, and it is being provided for, that there will be an examination aide provided for just the operation and administration of the oral exams but they will specifically provide five additional days to be used in whatever way the school deems fit to support students at that time.	spk_258

At the same time, there has long since been a recognition that across a system as large as the education sector, there will always be students with exceptional needs and circumstances. As such, there has been a system of exemptions from this requirement to learn Irish in place since the 1970s.  New circulars setting out the circumstances under which schools may consider granting an exemption from the study of Irish were published in 2022 following a review of older circulars. The current circular now allows parents of children who have a high level of multiple and persistent needs that are a significant barrier to their participation and engagement in their learning and school life to apply for an exemption. The overall number of exemptions in place at primary level in 2017/18 was 18,301, compared to 13,060 in 2022/23, a drop from 3.25% of pupils to 2.34% of pupils. In 2017/18, 82.8% of exemptions were on the basis of special educational needs, SEN, while 17.2% were granted to children coming from abroad. In 2022/23, 93.6% of exemptions were granted on a SEN basis and 6.4% were granted on a coming-from-abroad basis. In effect, we have seen a decline in the number of exemptions in primary school and a significant turnaround in that of those that are granted, almost 94% are granted on the basis of SEN and 6.4% are granted on the basis of the students coming from abroad. At post-primary level, there were 49,570 exemptions in place in the 2022/23 school year.

Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	Since 2020, the Department of Education has invested in the region of €4.3 billion in our schools throughout the country, involving the completion of over 750 school building projects and with construction currently underway at approximately 300 other projects, which includes 34 new school buildings. Projects currently at construction involve a total State investment of over €1.2 billion. This is a record level of investment in our schools which highlights the Government’s very strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities. The key drivers of capital investment in the schools sector include demographic growth, particularly at post-primary level; increased demand for special educational needs provision; alignment of school place provision with new housing development; and climate action objectives, including deep energy retrofit. The project raised by the Deputy relates to a summer works scheme application. The purpose of the summer works scheme is to enable individual school authorities to undertake small-scale building works on a devolved basis and, ideally, can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of the school. The summer works scheme operates on a multi-annual basis for categories of works such as roof works, window replacement, mechanical and electrical works and external works. The Department has committed in excess of €125 million in funding for summer works projects during 2022 and 2023. I can advise that the school in question submitted its pre-tender report to the Department’s planning and building unit and this was reviewed in detail by members of the summer works and professional and technical teams. A number of recommendations were made by the professional and technical team in respect of the proposed scope of works to ensure the project will comply with the Department’s technical guidance documents when complete. The Department requested that these recommendations be included by the design team in the project scope, and requested that a revised pre-tender report be submitted. The recommendations were notified to the school by email on 28 September 2023. The school advised that the board of management would discuss the recommendations with the appointed design team and revert to the Department as soon as practicable. Department officials remain available to assist the school authority in delivering a successful project and await that information from the school. The Department is leading an ambitious sustainability agenda and has progressed a wide array of measures to improve the overall sustainability of our school buildings. 	spk_282

The Department has engaged directly with the principal here. The Department obviously wants to get this over the line. We are happy to engage on a one-to-one basis with schools where they might have a difficulty. In principle, we recognise the importance of this work. We are obliged to have everything as it should be from a technical point of view. If a school is having difficulty with supplying information, we are happy to work with it directly. We have intervened with the principal directly on this. I hope that whatever issues are there can be surmounted in the shortest timeframe possible.

Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	I am not aware of the details of the individual school that Deputy Ó Murchú has raised, but I will look at that. I am aware of the very specific case that has been raised by Deputy McAuliffe. It is an excellent example of the willingness of the Department to engage on a direct basis with schools. Over the last number of years, in the lifetime of this Government, over €4.2 billion has been provided for school buildings, whether brand new, additional accommodation or whatever, or to speak to Deputy McAuliffe's point, for deep energy retrofit which will re-energise and reinvigorate an old building and give it a new lease of life, which is important. It would be a shame not to be able to utilise buildings to their maximum because of their age. If we can preserve a building, we will do that. On the specific case that was raised earlier, I can clearly point to examples of where the Department engaged directly with the principal or the patron, or whoever might be the contact person, to get over any difficulties or issues that they might have to bring a project to fruition. At the end of the day, there are standards that must be applied and requirements that must be fulfilled, but the Department will work with the school to ensure that is the case.	spk_288
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	In the current school year, more than 161,600 children, including over 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post-primary services, 19,800 pupils with special educational needs, and 6,800 pupils who arrived in Ireland from Ukraine, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. As such, the school transport scheme represents a highly significant logistical operation and is a significant pillar of Ireland’s public transport system. The total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02 million. There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023-24 school year in comparison with the 2022-23 school year. Under the current terms of the scheme, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from, and are attending, their nearest school and, at post-primary level, where they reside not less than 4.8 km from, and are attending, their nearest post-primary school or education centre, as determined by the Department and Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language. Any children who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or are otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for. The school transport scheme has been operating for more than 55 years since its establishment in 1967. This review is one of the most extensive investigations that has been carried out into the scheme since then. Undoubtedly, the school transport scheme is of huge importance to families, and there has been a significant amount of change in this country since the scheme was initially established. A review of the school transport scheme has recently been completed by a steering group with high-level membership from relevant Departments and other bodies, reflecting the importance of the scheme for access to education and other wider Government objectives. The review has been conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure it serves students and their families efficiently and effectively. Considering how to best maximise the benefits now and into the future has been a significant factor in the ongoing review of the scheme, which commenced in February 2021.	spk_301
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	I acknowledge that interim measures were taken by the Department following the first phase of the review, namely, the temporary alleviation measures, TAMS, introduced at post-primary level, which are being continued for the current school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport is provided where there is a route in operation and where capacity exists for concessionary post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school, are attending their second-nearest school, and who applied and paid on time. The Deputy referenced the extensive engagement that took place. This was quite significant because it was the first time in the 55 years of the school transport system that such a review took place. It is my aim and expectation that we will publish it in the first quarter of this year. The steps for that are for the review to go to a Cabinet sub-committee and then to Cabinet. Following that, it will be published. Prior to the review going to Cabinet, I am not in a position to give the detail on it. However, it will be published in the first quarter of this year.	spk_303
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	At the outset I would like to say that I appreciate the importance of the school transport scheme. I know of its value in many rural areas in particular. It was for that reason we ensured we got the widest spectrum of opinion in terms of how we should operate. That was not just families currently using the system, but families who have not used the system and would like to use it. There were those who engaged with the system from a special education point of view. An analysis of school transport schemes in other jurisdictions was also conducted. This included looking at systems in the EU, the UK, the United States and Australia. The final report and its recommendations on the future operation and strategic development of the scheme will be brought before a Cabinet subcommittee. It will then be brought before Cabinet, and it will only be at that point we will be in a position to say what actions will be determined by Government. However, nobody for one minute underestimates the value and importance of the school transport scheme.	spk_307
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	I did not get a chance to respond to Deputy Ó Laoghaire but I will come back to him at another time. The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year more than 161,000 children, including more than 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post-primary services, 19,800 pupils with special educational needs and 6,800 pupils who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine are transported daily to primary and post-primary schools. As referenced earlier, the total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02 million. There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023-2024 school year in comparison to the 2022-2023 school year, which again points to the importance of the school transport scheme. Everybody is aware of the criteria. At primary school level the student must reside not less 3.2 km from and attend their nearest national school. At post-primary level they must reside not less than 4.8 km from and attend their nearest post-primary school. The school transport scheme is a demand-led scheme based on the number of children who apply. The scheme is operated using a mix of Bus Éireann owned vehicles and directly recruited drivers and private contractors who recruit their own drivers to operate on the scheme. As part of the operation of the scheme, Bus Éireann manages the procurement tender process and contract management arrangements to include services provided by contractors under the school transport scheme. There are currently in the region of 7,000 vehicles operating on the scheme. The competitive procurement process is conducted in accordance with the negotiated procedure under national and EU procurement legislation. As more than 90% of school bus services are contracted locally, each contractor recruits school bus drivers directly. Each contractor is responsible for ensuring that all the required training has been provided to their drivers and that all the necessary licences and professional standards are in place. The safety of children and young people using the school transport scheme is of paramount importance, and we all appreciate that. While Bus Éireann advertises for contractors through eTenders in accordance with national and EU procurement legislation, it has also sought taxi or bus operators through a mix of targeted campaigns through NTA bulletins.	spk_309
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	I acknowledge that Deputy O'Sullivan raised a similar issue. I also acknowledge that in the current school year Bus Éireann reported particular issues with the availability of drivers and contractors. This included a number handing contracts back unexpectedly and the receipt of zero bids handed out for contracts tendered out in certain areas. This is against a backdrop of significant driver shortages in the labour market overall, and competing demands for drivers to deliver additional public service initiatives such as Connecting Ireland, BusConnects, Local Link services and such schemes. Bus Éireann continues to prioritise sourcing drivers and contractors for the small number of areas where transport is not available. As well as commencing the planning process earlier for the 2024-2025 school year, the Department engages with Bus Éireann daily relating to operational matters. Monthly operational and quarterly strategic meetings are also held. The Department continues to engage closely with Bus Éireann on the current and future availability of drivers and contractors, which as reported is the wider issue nationally. The Department of Education also engages regularly with the Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority.	spk_311
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	If the nearest school is full, the next nearest school becomes the school for which transport will be automatically provided. I would be interested in seeing the individual circumstances for that one. Regarding having an appropriate number of bus drivers, as I said earlier this is not unique to the school transport system and is a wider issue for transport providers. Bus Éireann has conducted a national and local media advertising campaign seeking additional drivers and contractor operators for the scheme. As late as yesterday I heard a specific campaign targeted towards females who might be interested in taking up positions as bus drivers. There is a comprehensive recruitment campaign where possible. The question of age is a matter for Bus Éireann. It is very much within its remit to determine the age qualification. Bus Éireann has engaged and told us it will keep it under review.	spk_315
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	Since 2020, my Department has invested in the region of €4.3 billion in our schools throughout the country, involving the completion of more than 800 school building projects. Construction is under way on approximately 300 projects, which includes 34 new school buildings. These 300 projects at construction involve a total State investment of in excess of €1.2 billion. There are also 90 projects at the tender process including a further 28 new school buildings. All of these new school buildings are flagship projects in their area and will transform the education infrastructure for those school communities. This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s very strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities. The permanent building project for Greystones Community College will deliver a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school and accommodation, including four classrooms for children with special educational needs. The project is being delivered under my Department's design and build programme and is at tender stage. The invitation to tender for the project issued in April 2023 as part of a bundle of projects for ten schools issued to the Department's framework of design and build contractors. Given the scale of works involving new purpose-built accommodation for ten schools, some of which are on-campus sites, the tender process involves a very large volume of documentation and drawings and takes approximately eight to 12 months. Tender returns have been received and are being evaluated. Given the scale of this investment, this tender evaluation process by the Department's technical staff and project management team takes time to work through properly. The Department is very conscious of the importance of getting these projects, including the project for Greystones Community College, delivered as quickly as possible. The tender evaluation process is well advanced and will be coming to a conclusion shortly. Once the contractor has been appointed, it is anticipated that construction will commence shortly thereafter. The construction duration for the project is estimated at 65 weeks. The Department will continue to keep the school and its patron body updated as the project progresses. Requirements for school places are kept under ongoing review in the context of available information on population, enrolments and residential development activity.	spk_317
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	I appreciate the importance of the provision of school places. As I mentioned, there has been a significant investment by the Department of Education, with more than €4.2 billion over the years since this Government came into office. A sum of €1.2 billion has been allocated this year for works at various stages of construction. There is significant demand for places in areas where there has been exponential growth in housing. I acknowledge the co-operation we have received from schools on the ground. For example, a few days ago there was announcement of an additional 47 places being made available to accommodate first-year students in this area. More will be done when clearer numbers for the requirements are made available to us in the area the Deputy mentioned. On the two schools the Deputy mentioned, it is a priority for the Department to deliver all projects in a timely and efficient manner and to meet the needs. Where we are not in a position to meet the needs immediately, we provide modular accommodation.	spk_319
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	I thank the Deputy for his question. I published an initial teacher education policy statement in 2023, presenting a vision for policy and provision across the sector. It aims to ensure student teachers at primary and post-primary level have the skills to support all of our children and young people as learners in the years ahead. One of the policy's guiding principles is the continuation of the vision that initial teacher education will be led by a small number of university-led centres of teacher education excellence and that each of these will have a critical mass to provide for good teaching, research and international co-operation, with structures to ensure meaningful collaboration across educational sectors. This reaffirms the position first set out in the 2012 report of the international review panel on the structure of initial teacher education in Ireland. At that time, there were 19 publicly funded higher education institutions providing programmes for primary and post-primary teachers. There were also a number of private providers. However, this growth was not co-ordinated and had evolved in a piecemeal manner, resulting in a variety of models of provision by a range of providers. The review panel concluded that this provision did not concur with high-performing international practice. A review of progress, carried out by Professor Pasi Sahlberg in 2019, found considerable progress towards achieving this objective. Under section 38 of the Teaching Council Act, all initial teacher education programmes must be accredited by the Teaching Council for registration purposes. The policy statement includes a phased implementation plan that sets out practical ways to enhance initial teacher education in the years ahead. My Department continues to work closely with the Department of further and higher education as well as with the Teaching Council in this regard. Within this context, the policy statement recognises the contributions technological universities can make to providing subject expertise for initial teacher education. A number of technological universities are already involved and contributing to initial teacher education in a range of areas, while the linkage to a centre in line with policy remains key. At present, a bachelor of education in technology, engineering and graphics (post-primary) is being delivered through a partnership of Dublin City University and Technological University of the Shannon, Athlone.	spk_321
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_22	I was in my conclusion going to say there are examples of technological universities making provision in this area. The bachelor of education in technology, engineering and graphics at post-primary level is being delivered by a partnership between DCU and Technological University Shannon Athlone. The first two years of study takes place at the TUS Athlone campus and the final two years at the DCU institute of education in Dublin. This is an excellent example of the type of innovative collaboration which can take place. As autonomous bodies, it falls to individual higher education institutions to consider the scope of their further provision in line with their missions or strategies. The Department of Education favours new programmes being introduced in areas where there is an identified national need. In this regard, it would be expected there would be a liaison with the Department by higher education institutions, as well as with the Teaching Council and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, when considering new programme proposals. It is also expected due regard would be given to the available data on teacher supply needs. The policy statement includes a number of actions in this vein, as previously outlined. 	spk_323

If the local technological university is in a position to make a proposal, there is an identified need and it chooses to liaise with the three bodies mentioned, that can be given consideration. It is not just one singular responsibility; there is a triumvirate that must be engaged with and it must be seen to be of benefit and to meet a need on the ground.	spk_325

The Department has engaged directly with the principal here. The Department obviously wants to get this over the line. We are happy to engage on a one-to-one basis with schools where they might have a difficulty. In principle, we recognise the importance of this work. We are obliged to have everything as it should be from a technical point of view. If a school is having difficulty with supplying information, we are happy to work with it directly. We have intervened with the principal directly on this. I hope that whatever issues are there can be surmounted in the shortest timeframe possible. There is an absolute willingness on our part to work directly with the school.	spk_284
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_25	I am not aware of the details of the individual school that Deputy Ó Murchú has raised, but I will look at that. I am aware of the very specific case that has been raised by Deputy McAuliffe. It is an excellent example of the willingness of the Department to engage on a direct basis with schools. Over the last number of years, in the lifetime of this Government, over €4.2 billion has been provided for school buildings, whether brand new, additional accommodation or whatever, or to speak to Deputy McAuliffe's point, for deep energy retrofit which will re-energise and reinvigorate an old building and give it a new lease of life, which is important. It would be a shame not to be able to utilise buildings to their maximum because of their age. If we can preserve a building, we will do that. On the specific case that was raised earlier, I can clearly point to examples of where the Department engaged directly with the principal or the patron, or whoever might be the contact person, to get over any difficulties or issues that they might have to bring a project to fruition. At the end of the day, there are standards that must be applied and requirements that must be fulfilled, but the Department will work with the school to ensure that is the case.	spk_288
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_27	In the current school year, more than 161,600 children, including over 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post-primary services, 19,800 pupils with special educational needs, and 6,800 pupils who arrived in Ireland from Ukraine, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. As such, the school transport scheme represents a highly significant logistical operation and is a significant pillar of Ireland’s public transport system. The total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02 million. There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023-24 school year in comparison with the 2022-23 school year. Under the current terms of the scheme, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from, and are attending, their nearest school and, at post-primary level, where they reside not less than 4.8 km from, and are attending, their nearest post-primary school or education centre, as determined by the Department and Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language. Any children who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or are otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for. The school transport scheme has been operating for more than 55 years since its establishment in 1967. This review is one of the most extensive investigations that has been carried out into the scheme since then. Undoubtedly, the school transport scheme is of huge importance to families, and there has been a significant amount of change in this country since the scheme was initially established. A review of the school transport scheme has recently been completed by a steering group with high-level membership from relevant Departments and other bodies, reflecting the importance of the scheme for access to education and other wider Government objectives. The review has been conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure it serves students and their families efficiently and effectively. Considering how to best maximise the benefits now and into the future has been a significant factor in the ongoing review of the scheme, which commenced in February 2021.	spk_301
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_27	I acknowledge that interim measures were taken by the Department following the first phase of the review, namely, the temporary alleviation measures, TAMS, introduced at post-primary level, which are being continued for the current school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport is provided where there is a route in operation and where capacity exists for concessionary post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school, are attending their second-nearest school, and who applied and paid on time. The Deputy referenced the extensive engagement that took place. This was quite significant because it was the first time in the 55 years of the school transport system that such a review took place. It is my aim and expectation that we will publish it in the first quarter of this year. The steps for that are for the review to go to a Cabinet sub-committee and then to Cabinet. Following that, it will be published. Prior to the review going to Cabinet, I am not in a position to give the detail on it. However, it will be published in the first quarter of this year.	spk_303
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_27	At the outset I would like to say that I appreciate the importance of the school transport scheme. I know of its value in many rural areas in particular. It was for that reason we ensured we got the widest spectrum of opinion in terms of how we should operate. That was not just families currently using the system, but families who have not used the system and would like to use it. There were those who engaged with the system from a special education point of view. An analysis of school transport schemes in other jurisdictions was also conducted. This included looking at systems in the EU, the UK, the United States and Australia. The final report and its recommendations on the future operation and strategic development of the scheme will be brought before a Cabinet subcommittee. It will then be brought before Cabinet, and it will only be at that point we will be in a position to say what actions will be determined by Government. However, nobody for one minute underestimates the value and importance of the school transport scheme.	spk_307
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_28	I did not get a chance to respond to Deputy Ó Laoghaire but I will come back to him at another time. The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year more than 161,000 children, including more than 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post-primary services, 19,800 pupils with special educational needs and 6,800 pupils who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine are transported daily to primary and post-primary schools. As referenced earlier, the total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02 million. There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023-2024 school year in comparison to the 2022-2023 school year, which again points to the importance of the school transport scheme. Everybody is aware of the criteria. At primary school level the student must reside not less 3.2 km from and attend their nearest national school. At post-primary level they must reside not less than 4.8 km from and attend their nearest post-primary school. The school transport scheme is a demand-led scheme based on the number of children who apply. The scheme is operated using a mix of Bus Éireann owned vehicles and directly recruited drivers and private contractors who recruit their own drivers to operate on the scheme. As part of the operation of the scheme, Bus Éireann manages the procurement tender process and contract management arrangements to include services provided by contractors under the school transport scheme. There are currently in the region of 7,000 vehicles operating on the scheme. The competitive procurement process is conducted in accordance with the negotiated procedure under national and EU procurement legislation. As more than 90% of school bus services are contracted locally, each contractor recruits school bus drivers directly. Each contractor is responsible for ensuring that all the required training has been provided to their drivers and that all the necessary licences and professional standards are in place. The safety of children and young people using the school transport scheme is of paramount importance, and we all appreciate that. While Bus Éireann advertises for contractors through eTenders in accordance with national and EU procurement legislation, it has also sought taxi or bus operators through a mix of targeted campaigns through NTA bulletins.	spk_309
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_28	I acknowledge that Deputy O'Sullivan raised a similar issue. I also acknowledge that in the current school year Bus Éireann reported particular issues with the availability of drivers and contractors. This included a number handing contracts back unexpectedly and the receipt of zero bids handed out for contracts tendered out in certain areas. This is against a backdrop of significant driver shortages in the labour market overall, and competing demands for drivers to deliver additional public service initiatives such as Connecting Ireland, BusConnects, Local Link services and such schemes. Bus Éireann continues to prioritise sourcing drivers and contractors for the small number of areas where transport is not available. As well as commencing the planning process earlier for the 2024-2025 school year, the Department engages with Bus Éireann daily relating to operational matters. Monthly operational and quarterly strategic meetings are also held. The Department continues to engage closely with Bus Éireann on the current and future availability of drivers and contractors, which as reported is the wider issue nationally. The Department of Education also engages regularly with the Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority.	spk_311
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_28	If the nearest school is full, the next nearest school becomes the school for which transport will be automatically provided. I would be interested in seeing the individual circumstances for that one. Regarding having an appropriate number of bus drivers, as I said earlier this is not unique to the school transport system and is a wider issue for transport providers. Bus Éireann has conducted a national and local media advertising campaign seeking additional drivers and contractor operators for the scheme. As late as yesterday I heard a specific campaign targeted towards females who might be interested in taking up positions as bus drivers. There is a comprehensive recruitment campaign where possible. The question of age is a matter for Bus Éireann. It is very much within its remit to determine the age qualification. Bus Éireann has engaged and told us it will keep it under review.	spk_315
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_29	Since 2020, my Department has invested in the region of €4.3 billion in our schools throughout the country, involving the completion of more than 800 school building projects. Construction is under way on approximately 300 projects, which includes 34 new school buildings. These 300 projects at construction involve a total State investment of in excess of €1.2 billion. There are also 90 projects at the tender process including a further 28 new school buildings. All of these new school buildings are flagship projects in their area and will transform the education infrastructure for those school communities. This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s very strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities. The permanent building project for Greystones Community College will deliver a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school and accommodation, including four classrooms for children with special educational needs. The project is being delivered under my Department's design and build programme and is at tender stage. The invitation to tender for the project issued in April 2023 as part of a bundle of projects for ten schools issued to the Department's framework of design and build contractors. Given the scale of works involving new purpose-built accommodation for ten schools, some of which are on-campus sites, the tender process involves a very large volume of documentation and drawings and takes approximately eight to 12 months. Tender returns have been received and are being evaluated. Given the scale of this investment, this tender evaluation process by the Department's technical staff and project management team takes time to work through properly. The Department is very conscious of the importance of getting these projects, including the project for Greystones Community College, delivered as quickly as possible. The tender evaluation process is well advanced and will be coming to a conclusion shortly. Once the contractor has been appointed, it is anticipated that construction will commence shortly thereafter. The construction duration for the project is estimated at 65 weeks. The Department will continue to keep the school and its patron body updated as the project progresses. Requirements for school places are kept under ongoing review in the context of available information on population, enrolments and residential development activity.	spk_317
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_29	I appreciate the importance of the provision of school places. As I mentioned, there has been a significant investment by the Department of Education, with more than €4.2 billion over the years since this Government came into office. A sum of €1.2 billion has been allocated this year for works at various stages of construction. There is significant demand for places in areas where there has been exponential growth in housing. I acknowledge the co-operation we have received from schools on the ground. For example, a few days ago there was announcement of an additional 47 places being made available to accommodate first-year students in this area. More will be done when clearer numbers for the requirements are made available to us in the area the Deputy mentioned. On the two schools the Deputy mentioned, it is a priority for the Department to deliver all projects in a timely and efficient manner and to meet the needs. Where we are not in a position to meet the needs immediately, we provide modular accommodation.	spk_319
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_30	I thank the Deputy for his question. I published an initial teacher education policy statement in 2023, presenting a vision for policy and provision across the sector. It aims to ensure student teachers at primary and post-primary level have the skills to support all of our children and young people as learners in the years ahead. One of the policy's guiding principles is the continuation of the vision that initial teacher education will be led by a small number of university-led centres of teacher education excellence and that each of these will have a critical mass to provide for good teaching, research and international co-operation, with structures to ensure meaningful collaboration across educational sectors. This reaffirms the position first set out in the 2012 report of the international review panel on the structure of initial teacher education in Ireland. At that time, there were 19 publicly funded higher education institutions providing programmes for primary and post-primary teachers. There were also a number of private providers. However, this growth was not co-ordinated and had evolved in a piecemeal manner, resulting in a variety of models of provision by a range of providers. The review panel concluded that this provision did not concur with high-performing international practice. A review of progress, carried out by Professor Pasi Sahlberg in 2019, found considerable progress towards achieving this objective. Under section 38 of the Teaching Council Act, all initial teacher education programmes must be accredited by the Teaching Council for registration purposes. The policy statement includes a phased implementation plan that sets out practical ways to enhance initial teacher education in the years ahead. My Department continues to work closely with the Department of further and higher education as well as with the Teaching Council in this regard. Within this context, the policy statement recognises the contributions technological universities can make to providing subject expertise for initial teacher education. A number of technological universities are already involved and contributing to initial teacher education in a range of areas, while the linkage to a centre in line with policy remains key. At present, a bachelor of education in technology, engineering and graphics (post-primary) is being delivered through a partnership of Dublin City University and Technological University of the Shannon, Athlone.	spk_321
Norma Foley	52	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2024-02-13	dail	33	Teaching Qualifications	dbsect_30	I was in my conclusion going to say there are examples of technological universities making provision in this area. The bachelor of education in technology, engineering and graphics at post-primary level is being delivered by a partnership between DCU and Technological University Shannon Athlone. The first two years of study takes place at the TUS Athlone campus and the final two years at the DCU institute of education in Dublin. This is an excellent example of the type of innovative collaboration which can take place. As autonomous bodies, it falls to individual higher education institutions to consider the scope of their further provision in line with their missions or strategies. The Department of Education favours new programmes being introduced in areas where there is an identified national need. In this regard, it would be expected there would be a liaison with the Department by higher education institutions, as well as with the Teaching Council and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, when considering new programme proposals. It is also expected due regard would be given to the available data on teacher supply needs. The policy statement includes a number of actions in this vein, as previously outlined. 	spk_323

If the local technological university is in a position to make a proposal, there is an identified need and it chooses to liaise with the three bodies mentioned, that can be given consideration. It is not just one singular responsibility; there is a triumvirate that must be engaged with and it must be seen to be of benefit and to meet a need on the ground.	spk_325

I thank the House for the opportunity to discuss the co-ordination and response in the education area to those seeking protection here in Ireland. My Department is committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential. As Minister for Education, and as a teacher, I firmly believe schools continuously strive to create an inclusive environment for children from diverse backgrounds, encompassing Irish children as well as children from migrant and refugee families. Schools play a vital role in their communities. Integration in school is important for the well-being of children and young people. It is also important in promoting social cohesion and reducing prejudice in all parts of society. I want to assure the House that meeting the educational needs of children and young people seeking protection is important to me as Minister and to my officials. As a Department, we are committed to continuing our support for those substantial efforts we are seeing from school communities on the ground. I wish to pay particular tribute to the fantastic work that our schools have done in welcoming so many children and young people seeking protection who have arrived in our country in recent times, and previously. I have witnessed at first hand this exceptional effort by all members of school communities, boards of management, principals, staff, students and families, as well as the wider community. My Department's policy of integrating school-aged migrant children and young people into existing schools as quickly as possible, given that it can have a stabilising effect on children, has worked well to date because of the enormous level of co-operation by schools on the ground. Members will appreciate the scale of the response needed, given that well over 100,000 people have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine alone since the beginning of the war. Alongside Ukrainian people seeking protection, 26,500 people from different nationalities are also seeking protection here. Just over 18,000 children from Ukraine have now enrolled in schools in every county across the State. This includes more than 11,000 children in primary schools and almost 7,000 in post-primary schools. In addition, there are more than 3,600 children enrolled in schools that are living in IPAS settings. The Department of Education established regional education and language teams, known as REALT, to support existing services in responding to the needs of Ukrainians and children seeking international protection in accessing education.Their primary role is to assist in securing school places for children and to support schools in meeting the needs of children as they arise. Children and young people learning English as an additional language, EAL, require well-planned support tailored to meet their individual language needs in order to participate fully in school life and derive maximum benefit from their education. The Department provides English language support to schools with pupils who are newly arrived in the country with English as an additional language. Schools may also apply for further language support through the staffing appeals process. Figures show that 1,676 primary and 491 post-primary schools have applied for and are now receiving EAL teaching resources. In 2022, additional temporary special education supports were put in place to support schools with large Ukrainian enrolments. Schools in which ten or more Ukrainian pupils are enrolled are provided with additional special education teaching resources and schools with 15 or more Ukrainian pupils are provided with additional special needs assistants. A total of 611 schools received additional temporary special education teaching hours and 374 received additional temporary SNA supports. The same level of resources is available under a separate process to support schools that have enrolled a significant number of children seeking international protection. Children fleeing the war in Ukraine and those seeking international protection can face challenges relating to personal, physical and emotional safety. The well-being of children is at the core of all that we do in the education system. Supporting well-being allows children to feel safe and happy in school and to learn. We are lucky that our schools provide a caring and supportive environment in which children can flourish. Guidance counsellors support refugee and migrant children in post-primary schools in terms of personal, social, educational and career development. This could include, for example, advice for Ukrainian students about which programme to enrol in at senior cycle level, information on grants, subject choice and entry requirements to institutions and career guidance information. As well as providing supports to schools, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, continues to gather information on Ukrainian and other refugee experiences through interaction in schools, participation in REALTs and keeping up to date with national and international research. On the basis of the evidence and experience, NEPS has developed a range of supports and resources for refugee and migrant children, including well-being resources for students from Ukraine, which are available on  I thank the House for the opportunity to provide an update on the actions being taken to support the educational needs of students arriving in Ireland seeking protection.

I join previous speakers in extending my support and solidarity to the children and their carer who were impacted by the horrific event in Parnell Square on a recent Thursday afternoon, and also their wider community, especially their school community. I acknowledge, as has been referenced by previous speakers, that among the first responders to that incident were NEPS psychologists, the school psychologists from the Department of Education. They were there on the Thursday and again on the Friday to work with senior management when the school was closed, then again over the weekend, on Sunday, to work with senior management, and again on Monday when the school reopened. They are there every single day to support these children and the school community as it finds a way forward after this horrific and tragic incident. We tell our young people in our schools that all will be well when we work together in solidarity, mind each other, support each other and work as a cohesive unit. How shameful for them to see the politicking that is going on inside and outside this Chamber by those who should know better, those who seek to sow division and divisiveness and those who should show leadership, solidarity and community cohesion at a time when we need it in this country. I have 100% confidence in the Minister, Deputy McEntee, in recognition of the strong and positive work she does every single day in the name of communities right across this country. As the Minister for Justice, she has wide responsibilities and functions, chief among which is the tackling of crime and ensuring that those who perpetrate crime are brought to justice.

We are particularly mindful of the children and their carer who were involved in an incident in proximity to a school on Parnell Square. I can confirm for the House that our NEPS psychologists, our school psychologists, have been in the school since the incident occurred. They continue to be there, engaging with senior management and the other staff. Additional support from a staff point of view is being provided for the school. This was an horrific incident that happened, as I said, in proximity to a school. We are very mindful of the trauma it has visited not just on the school community but on the wider community. We send our very best wishes for a speedy recovery to all the children and the carer, especially the child who remains in the care of the hospital. I thank the House for its unified support and commend the school community on the excellent leadership it is showing at a very difficult time. I thank the Deputy for the question. There are five higher education institutions providing primary initial teacher education in Ireland: four State-funded providers and one private provider. Each of the four primary State-funded providers has both concurrent, or undergraduate, and consecutive, or postgraduate, programmes. These are DCU Institute of Education, Marino Institute of Education, Maynooth University and Mary Immaculate College. Each year, the number of students admitted to primary concurrent and consecutive programmes in State-funded HEIs is determined by the Department, having regard to teacher supply and demand issues and available resources. Hibernia College is a privately owned institution which provides a primary consecutive programme only. The Department has no involvement in setting the numbers for Hibernia. There are 11 State-funded providers of post-primary initial teacher education in Ireland: DCU, Maynooth, Mary Immaculate College, University College Dublin, the University of Galway, University College Cork, the University of Limerick, Trinity College Dublin, the Technological University of the Shannon, Atlantic Technological University, which now includes the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and St. Angela's, and the National College of Art and Design. These institutions provide a range of concurrent and consecutive programmes. Hibernia College also provides a post-primary consecutive ITE programme. Conscious that the professional master of education represents a very significant undertaking for students, I was delighted as part of budget 2024 to announce that a new incentive scheme will be introduced for newly qualified teachers graduating in 2024. Following engagement with the four State-funded HEIs providing primary initial teacher education, I also approved 610 additional places, with 320 of those approved for 2023 and the remaining 290 in 2024. The new places are as follows: 90 on the bachelor of education programme in 2023 and 2024, making a total of 1,090 each year; 30 additional places on the bachelor of education through the medium of Irish in 2023, making a total of 60 in 2023; and 200 additional places on the professional master of education programme in 2023 and 2024, making a total of 400 each year.	spk_104
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_17	At post-primary level it is the higher education institute that determines the number of places in accordance with its own available resources and arrangements. A total of 1,650 teachers graduate from these programmes each year. As regards the overall enrolments on the initial teacher education programmes, 2022-23 is the most recent year for which confirmed data is available. There were 4,700 students enrolled in primary programmes and 6,000 students enrolled in post-primary programmes across the State. I understand that Hibernia, a private college, currently has approximately 1,200 students enrolled in primary and 600 at post-primary. This means that, in total, there are approximately 12,500 people currently preparing to become primary and post-primary teachers across the State. The Deputy will see that the very significant bulk of them are coming from the State-funded sector. Equally, as I outlined, the 600 additional places at primary level that were provided for this year are also a significant boost in intake for the primary sector.	spk_106
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_17	I thank Deputy Clarke and I appreciate her personal engagement on this issue.

With regard to the point made about fees and the difficulties with them, I was very pleased in budget 2024 to announce that, for those taking a postgraduate course in teaching, a bursary of €2,000 will be made available to them. I appreciate what Deputy Clarke has said with regard to students needing to see it so they can be it, and this is referenced consistently in the House. They need to see diversity. We have diversity in our classrooms and we need to see diversity in those who teach and those who work in SNA positions in our classrooms. I commend the excellent work being done by many of the providers. I had the pleasure of attending on two consecutive years the graduation at Marino College of Further Education.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_17	I thank Deputy Ó Ríordáin. I acknowledge his personal engagement with me, and the engagement from throughout the House, on the incident on Parnell Square. Ensuring every child's experience in school is positive and that they have qualified, engaged teachers available to support them is a priority. Budget 2024 contains a range of measures that demonstrate commitment to continued investment in the education system. A professional masters of education incentive scheme, which I referenced earlier, is being introduced as a consequence of budget 2024. Newly qualified teachers who graduate with a PME will, subject to conditions, be eligible for an incentive payment of up to €2,000. This incentive payment will be paid to eligible primary and post-primary teachers in 2025. Additionally, there will be an expansion in the number of upskilling programmes available. These programmes, which are free to teachers, increase the number of teachers who are qualified to teach in-demand subjects. These new upskilling programmes in Irish, French, politics and society, and computer science will be in addition to existing upskilling programmes in maths, physics and Spanish. An additional 1,000 posts of responsibility are being provided in the school system. This is in recognition that school leaders play a key role in improving educational outcomes by creating a positive school climate and environment as well as motivating and empowering educators and learners within their school communities. These new measures are in addition to a range of targeted measures introduced in recent times, including, as I mentioned earlier, approving 610 additional places on initial teacher education primary level programmes for 2023-24 and ensuring initial teacher education providers created existing flexibilities that enable student teachers to support schools, either while on placement, or in a substitute capacity. It is worthy of note that in 2023, more than 2,700 student teachers registered with the Teaching Council and provided valuable support to schools as substitute teachers. We will continue the operation of primary substitute teacher supply panels in 2023-24, with 590 teaching posts allocated to 166 panels covering nearly 3,000 schools. We are encouraging retired teachers to provide substitute cover. A communications campaign was run and it is interesting to note that the number of days covered by retired teachers during this past year increased by 49%. Restrictions on job-sharing teachers and those on a career break from working as substitutes have been lifted.	spk_110

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_17	Since 2020, the Department of Education has invested in the region of €3.5 billion in our schools, involving the completion of more than 690 school building projects, and with construction under way at approximately 300 other projects. School building projects at construction involve an overall State investment of in excess of €1.2 billion. We also have 200 modular accommodation projects very well advanced for delivery or at the construction stage. This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s very strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities. I confirm to the Deputy that the Department is in receipt of an application for a new school building from the school authority in question. The school also made an application under the additional school accommodation, ASA, scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to ensure essential mainstream and special education classroom accommodation is available to cater for pupils in the area and where the need cannot be met by the school’s existing accommodation or at other nearby schools. As the Deputy may be aware, I met with the school authorities in relation to their ASA application in June 2021. Following this meeting, I directed an official from my planning and building unit's professional and technical section to visit the school. This technical assessment identified certain complexities with the existing school properties, including challenges with access and the topography of the school's two sites. My Department is currently considering the optimum way forward for the school in question following this technical report. Given the identified complexities with the existing school properties, there is a particular challenge in identifying a solution to the school’s accommodation needs that will support the continued effective operation of the school while presenting a sustainable solution to meet the primary school place needs in the area in the longer term. Demographic trends and capacity at other schools in the area form part of this consideration. In the first instance, my Department has a focus on any school accommodation provision that may be required in the short to medium term and, in that context, modular accommodation to facilitate two additional classrooms was approved for the school in question in 2022.	spk_116

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_17	As the Deputy is aware, the use of mobile devices and smartphones has increasingly become a part of the daily lives of our children and young people. While this can be a positive experience, we must also consider the potential harm associated with the misuse and-or overuse of these devices and associated social media platforms, particularly for younger children. While smartphone usage is, by and large, well-managed during the primary school day, there are concerns about usage outside of school and the prevalence of online bullying. It is important to note that I am not aware of any of our primary schools where phones are being used during school time. The issue raised with us, and that continues to be raised by parents, concerns not what is happening in the school but what is happening outside school hours. The well-being of all learners is a key priority of my Department, as well as the empowerment of parents and school communities through education and information. With this in mind, as the Deputy has said, I recently published guidelines for parents called Keeping Childhood Smartphone Free. These guidelines provide practical advice and suggestions to support parents and parents associations wishing to develop voluntary codes regarding smartphone use among primary school children. This initiative seeks to support parents who wish to come together with their school community to explore and agree on the best approach to mediate their children’s engagement with the online world, including adopting a voluntary code for their children to not have a smartphone until a certain time.We are suggesting that would be after sixth class. Ultimately, the aim of this initiative is to ensure the necessary supports and resources are available to inform and enable parents to support their children to navigate the online world safely and ethically.  The Department is acutely aware of the importance of online safety for children and continues to ensure there are extensive training and curricular supports available to assist schools and our school communities. A key resource in training and the provision of supports is the vital work undertaken by Webwise. Its role is focused on raising awareness of online safety issues and good practice among students and their parents and teachers. The new supports announced earlier this month will bolster the capacity of Webwise to educate and inform and continue to raise awareness.	spk_125
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_17	I thank the Deputy. I want to be very clear at the outset. What happened in Parnell Square, in close proximity to a school, was an unprecedented event. There are 4,000 schools, 1 million pupils and 100,000 school staff in Ireland. They are excellent environments in which children are mentored, minded, guarded and protected. I want to salute and acknowledge the excellent work that happens every single day in our schools. As a consequence of this particular incident, which happened in close proximity to a school, as I have outlined significant supports have been made available through the NEPS teams which have been in the school since the incident happened. They continue to be there and will support the school, staff and students. Significant funding has been made available through initiatives to Dublin's north inner city in terms of financing initiatives to support the area. I want to be very clear. The incident that occurred was not necessarily an incident related to the school, which is important. By that I mean that the individuals concerned, whether passers-by or the perpetrator of the crime, are not a reflection on the specific area and the very good people who live, work and send their children to the schools or crèches in the area. I want to be very clear. This is not indicative of the people who live and work in that area.	spk_127

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_17	I thank the Deputy. I acknowledge the excellent engagement from everyone here, including Deputy Gannon, and how supportive and helpful they have been to the local community, including the school community. I recognise in particular Deputy Gannon's personal engagement with me. On the wider issues the Deputy has raised, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Garda Commissioner have already highlighted a variety of initiatives that have been taken throughout the capital, including an increase in Garda presence and the type of supports that are being made available to gardaí to ensure the environment within the area is as it should be. A significant body of work is being done in that regard. In terms of a cross-agency response, the Department of Education is working with the HSE on the provision of supports for parents. We will continue to do that. There is a multifaceted response. Given that this question relates specifically to mobile phones, I want to take the opportunity to say we are very conscious of the need for children, in particular, not to use smartphones. We are not saying that young children should not have a phone, but rather that they would not have a smartphone until they have left sixth class because what they carry around in their pocket is not always appropriate for them.	spk_131
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_17	The Department recognises the importance of the minor works grant to primary schools. This funding provides good flexibility at local level to assist schools to manage and undertake works that support the daily operation of the school. Under Project Ireland 2040, a commitment was given that the minor works grant would be paid in either December or January of the school year to all primary schools, including special schools. In recent years, however, the Department’s approach has been to pay the minor works grant to primary schools in advance of the start of the following school year in order to facilitate a better lead-in period for schools over the summer period. A minor works grant of €30 million was paid in April 2023 to primary schools for the current school year. Schools have the autonomy to use this funding for maintenance and small-scale improvements to school buildings and grounds. Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. The works that can be undertaken under the minor works scheme include maintenance and small-scale improvements to school buildings and grounds, improvement or replacement of mechanical and electrical services, the purchase of standard furniture and physical education equipment, the purchase of floor coverings and window blinds, the purchase of IT-related equipment, ventilation improvements and enhancements to outdoor learning environments. Between 2018 and 2023, in the region of €310 million in minor works and enhanced minor works grants has been allocated to schools. In 2023, summer and emergency works grants to the tune of €80 million have been provided. This includes the additional support in the context of Covid-19 of the payment of an enhanced minor works grant totalling €45 million for primary and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of €17 million for post-primary schools. The enhanced minor works grant allowed schools that identified inadequate ventilation in a room to utilise their minor works grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor works grant did not cover the full cost of the works required. Currently, the minor works grant payable is a €5,500 basic grant plus €18.50 per mainstream pupil and €74 per special needs pupil.	spk_133
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_17	I fully understand the importance of the minor works grant. Considerable enhanced payments were made during Covid because we recognised the significance of the minor works grant. Minor works grants for 2023-24 were paid in advance of the school year, in April of this year, to ensure schools would have the lead-in time the Deputy speaks of and in order that works could be done at a quiet time, perhaps over the summer or whatever the case might be. In any event, the payments were given in April of this year. The funding for 2024-25 will be made available, as I said previously, in due course. The minor works grant is just one element of a record level of capital investment in school infrastructure. Since 2020, we have invested in the region of €3.5 billion to add capacity and develop and upgrade school facilities throughout the country for the almost 1 million students and more than 100,000 staff who learn and work in our schools every day.	spk_135
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_17	I do not underestimate the challenges schools face every day but I recognise also that ours is the third highest spending Department in government, which is indicative of the huge priority placed on education by the Government, at more than €10 billion. I acknowledge that last year, additional funding of €90 million was made available to schools from an energy point of view, while €81 million is being made available this year, of which €21 million will go into the core from a capitation point of view in budget 2024. On the specific question of the moneys that were paid and spent during Covid, not one school is being asked to repay one penny it spent during Covid. This was additional money that recognised that additional demands were being placed on schools, whether in the area of hand sanitiser, personal protective equipment, PPE, or the enhanced minor works grant. Whatever it happened to be, not one penny of that has been requested to be returned. Nevertheless, where schools have money they did not spend under a Covid heading, that is a different issue. If they have unspent money, they are being requested to return it, not money they have spent and used.	spk_137
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	Teacher Training	dbsect_18	I know we took the opportunity to do so yesterday at the education committee, but I again offer what I know is the unified solidarity, support and sympathy of the entire House. We are particularly mindful of the children and their carer who were involved in an incident in proximity to a school on Parnell Square. I can confirm for the House that our NEPS psychologists, our school psychologists, have been in the school since the incident occurred. They continue to be there, engaging with senior management and the other staff. Additional support from a staff point of view is being provided for the school. This was an horrific incident that happened, as I said, in proximity to a school. We are very mindful of the trauma it has visited not just on the school community but on the wider community. We send our very best wishes for a speedy recovery to all the children and the carer, especially the child who remains in the care of the hospital. I thank the House for its unified support and commend the school community on the excellent leadership it is showing at a very difficult time. I thank the Deputy for the question. There are five higher education institutions providing primary initial teacher education in Ireland: four State-funded providers and one private provider. Each of the four primary State-funded providers has both concurrent, or undergraduate, and consecutive, or postgraduate, programmes. These are DCU Institute of Education, Marino Institute of Education, Maynooth University and Mary Immaculate College. Each year, the number of students admitted to primary concurrent and consecutive programmes in State-funded HEIs is determined by the Department, having regard to teacher supply and demand issues and available resources. Hibernia College is a privately owned institution which provides a primary consecutive programme only. The Department has no involvement in setting the numbers for Hibernia. There are 11 State-funded providers of post-primary initial teacher education in Ireland: DCU, Maynooth, Mary Immaculate College, University College Dublin, the University of Galway, University College Cork, the University of Limerick, Trinity College Dublin, the Technological University of the Shannon, Atlantic Technological University, which now includes the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and St. Angela's, and the National College of Art and Design. These institutions provide a range of concurrent and consecutive programmes. Hibernia College also provides a post-primary consecutive ITE programme. Conscious that the professional master of education represents a very significant undertaking for students, I was delighted as part of budget 2024 to announce that a new incentive scheme will be introduced for newly qualified teachers graduating in 2024. Following engagement with the four State-funded HEIs providing primary initial teacher education, I also approved 610 additional places, with 320 of those approved for 2023 and the remaining 290 in 2024. The new places are as follows: 90 on the bachelor of education programme in 2023 and 2024, making a total of 1,090 each year; 30 additional places on the bachelor of education through the medium of Irish in 2023, making a total of 60 in 2023; and 200 additional places on the professional master of education programme in 2023 and 2024, making a total of 400 each year.	spk_104
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	Teacher Training	dbsect_18	At post-primary level it is the higher education institute that determines the number of places in accordance with its own available resources and arrangements. A total of 1,650 teachers graduate from these programmes each year. As regards the overall enrolments on the initial teacher education programmes, 2022-23 is the most recent year for which confirmed data is available. There were 4,700 students enrolled in primary programmes and 6,000 students enrolled in post-primary programmes across the State. I understand that Hibernia, a private college, currently has approximately 1,200 students enrolled in primary and 600 at post-primary. This means that, in total, there are approximately 12,500 people currently preparing to become primary and post-primary teachers across the State. The Deputy will see that the very significant bulk of them are coming from the State-funded sector. Equally, as I outlined, the 600 additional places at primary level that were provided for this year are also a significant boost in intake for the primary sector.	spk_106
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	Teacher Training	dbsect_18	I thank Deputy Clarke and I appreciate her personal engagement on this issue. More than 10,700 places have been provided by State-funded providers. There are 1,800 places with a private enterprise. With regard to the point made about fees and the difficulties with them, I was very pleased in budget 2024 to announce that, for those taking a postgraduate course in teaching, a bursary of €2,000 will be made available to them. I appreciate what Deputy Clarke has said with regard to students needing to see it so they can be it, and this is referenced consistently in the House. They need to see diversity. We have diversity in our classrooms and we need to see diversity in those who teach and those who work in SNA positions in our classrooms. I commend the excellent work being done by many of the providers. I had the pleasure of attending on two consecutive years the graduation at Marino College of Further Education. Over those years hundreds of students graduated, all from a diversity of backgrounds. This is only a positive in education.	spk_108

I acknowledge his personal engagement with me, and the engagement from throughout the House, on the incident on Parnell Square. Ensuring every child's experience in school is positive and that they have qualified, engaged teachers available to support them is a priority. Budget 2024 contains a range of measures that demonstrate commitment to continued investment in the education system. A professional masters of education incentive scheme, which I referenced earlier, is being introduced as a consequence of budget 2024. Newly qualified teachers who graduate with a PME will, subject to conditions, be eligible for an incentive payment of up to €2,000. This incentive payment will be paid to eligible primary and post-primary teachers in 2025. Additionally, there will be an expansion in the number of upskilling programmes available. These programmes, which are free to teachers, increase the number of teachers who are qualified to teach in-demand subjects. These new upskilling programmes in Irish, French, politics and society, and computer science will be in addition to existing upskilling programmes in maths, physics and Spanish. An additional 1,000 posts of responsibility are being provided in the school system. This is in recognition that school leaders play a key role in improving educational outcomes by creating a positive school climate and environment as well as motivating and empowering educators and learners within their school communities. These new measures are in addition to a range of targeted measures introduced in recent times, including, as I mentioned earlier, approving 610 additional places on initial teacher education primary level programmes for 2023-24 and ensuring initial teacher education providers created existing flexibilities that enable student teachers to support schools, either while on placement, or in a substitute capacity.

These guidelines provide practical advice and suggestions to support parents and parents associations wishing to develop voluntary codes regarding smartphone use among primary school children. This initiative seeks to support parents who wish to come together with their school community to explore and agree on the best approach to mediate their children’s engagement with the online world, including adopting a voluntary code for their children to not have a smartphone until a certain time.We are suggesting that would be after sixth class. Ultimately, the aim of this initiative is to ensure the necessary supports and resources are available to inform and enable parents to support their children to navigate the online world safely and ethically.  The Department is acutely aware of the importance of online safety for children and continues to ensure there are extensive training and curricular supports available to assist schools and our school communities. A key resource in training and the provision of supports is the vital work undertaken by Webwise. Its role is focused on raising awareness of online safety issues and good practice among students and their parents and teachers. The new supports announced earlier this month will bolster the capacity of Webwise to educate and inform and continue to raise awareness.	spk_125
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	Education Policy	dbsect_21	I thank the Deputy. I want to be very clear at the outset. What happened in Parnell Square, in close proximity to a school, was an unprecedented event. There are 4,000 schools, 1 million pupils and 100,000 school staff in Ireland. They are excellent environments in which children are mentored, minded, guarded and protected. I want to salute and acknowledge the excellent work that happens every single day in our schools. As a consequence of this particular incident, which happened in close proximity to a school, as I have outlined significant supports have been made available through the NEPS teams which have been in the school since the incident happened. They continue to be there and will support the school, staff and students. Significant funding has been made available through initiatives to Dublin's north inner city in terms of financing initiatives to support the area. I want to be very clear. The incident that occurred was not necessarily an incident related to the school, which is important. By that I mean that the individuals concerned, whether passers-by or the perpetrator of the crime, are not a reflection on the specific area and the very good people who live, work and send their children to the schools or crèches in the area. I want to be very clear. This is not indicative of the people who live and work in that area.	spk_127

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	Education Policy	dbsect_21	I thank the Deputy. I acknowledge the excellent engagement from everyone here, including Deputy Gannon, and how supportive and helpful they have been to the local community, including the school community. I recognise in particular Deputy Gannon's personal engagement with me. On the wider issues the Deputy has raised, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Garda Commissioner have already highlighted a variety of initiatives that have been taken throughout the capital, including an increase in Garda presence and the type of supports that are being made available to gardaí to ensure the environment within the area is as it should be. A significant body of work is being done in that regard. In terms of a cross-agency response, the Department of Education is working with the HSE on the provision of supports for parents. We will continue to do that. There is a multifaceted response. Given that this question relates specifically to mobile phones, I want to take the opportunity to say we are very conscious of the need for children, in particular, not to use smartphones. We are not saying that young children should not have a phone, but rather that they would not have a smartphone until they have left sixth class because what they carry around in their pocket is not always appropriate for them.	spk_131
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_22	The Department recognises the importance of the minor works grant to primary schools. This funding provides good flexibility at local level to assist schools to manage and undertake works that support the daily operation of the school. Under Project Ireland 2040, a commitment was given that the minor works grant would be paid in either December or January of the school year to all primary schools, including special schools. In recent years, however, the Department’s approach has been to pay the minor works grant to primary schools in advance of the start of the following school year in order to facilitate a better lead-in period for schools over the summer period. A minor works grant of €30 million was paid in April 2023 to primary schools for the current school year. Schools have the autonomy to use this funding for maintenance and small-scale improvements to school buildings and grounds. Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. The works that can be undertaken under the minor works scheme include maintenance and small-scale improvements to school buildings and grounds, improvement or replacement of mechanical and electrical services, the purchase of standard furniture and physical education equipment, the purchase of floor coverings and window blinds, the purchase of IT-related equipment, ventilation improvements and enhancements to outdoor learning environments. Between 2018 and 2023, in the region of €310 million in minor works and enhanced minor works grants has been allocated to schools. In 2023, summer and emergency works grants to the tune of €80 million have been provided. This includes the additional support in the context of Covid-19 of the payment of an enhanced minor works grant totalling €45 million for primary and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of €17 million for post-primary schools. The enhanced minor works grant allowed schools that identified inadequate ventilation in a room to utilise their minor works grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor works grant did not cover the full cost of the works required. Currently, the minor works grant payable is a €5,500 basic grant plus €18.50 per mainstream pupil and €74 per special needs pupil.	spk_133
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_22	I fully understand the importance of the minor works grant. Considerable enhanced payments were made during Covid because we recognised the significance of the minor works grant. Minor works grants for 2023-24 were paid in advance of the school year, in April of this year, to ensure schools would have the lead-in time the Deputy speaks of and in order that works could be done at a quiet time, perhaps over the summer or whatever the case might be. In any event, the payments were given in April of this year. The funding for 2024-25 will be made available, as I said previously, in due course. The minor works grant is just one element of a record level of capital investment in school infrastructure. Since 2020, we have invested in the region of €3.5 billion to add capacity and develop and upgrade school facilities throughout the country for the almost 1 million students and more than 100,000 staff who learn and work in our schools every day.	spk_135
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_22	I do not underestimate the challenges schools face every day but I recognise also that ours is the third highest spending Department in government, which is indicative of the huge priority placed on education by the Government, at more than €10 billion. I acknowledge that last year, additional funding of €90 million was made available to schools from an energy point of view, while €81 million is being made available this year, of which €21 million will go into the core from a capitation point of view in budget 2024. On the specific question of the moneys that were paid and spent during Covid, not one school is being asked to repay one penny it spent during Covid. This was additional money that recognised that additional demands were being placed on schools, whether in the area of hand sanitiser, personal protective equipment, PPE, or the enhanced minor works grant. Whatever it happened to be, not one penny of that has been requested to be returned. Nevertheless, where schools have money they did not spend under a Covid heading, that is a different issue. If they have unspent money, they are being requested to return it, not money they have spent and used.	spk_137
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	I thank the Deputy and acknowledge his engagement with me on this issue. I can confirm my Department recently received a request from the patron of the schools under reference for the amalgamation of the two schools. The proposal also included a request for a new school building for the amalgamated school. As the Deputy will be aware, the decision-making authority for school amalgamations belongs to the patron or trustees of a school, and this is subject to the approval of the Minister for Education. Any proposed change involves extensive negotiations at local level and must be well planned and managed in a manner that accommodates the interests of students, parents, teachers and local communities and contributes to an inclusive education system. My Department is reviewing the amalgamation proposal. This process is nearing completion and my officials will be in contact with the patron shortly. Since 2020, the Department of Education has invested in the region of €3.5 billion in our schools throughout the country, involving the completion of more than 690 school building projects and with construction currently under way on approximately 300 other projects. School building projects at construction involve an overall State investment of more than €1.2 billion. We also have 200 modular accommodation projects that are well advanced. This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities. The main focus of my Department’s capital funding over the past decade and for the coming period is on the provision of critical additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics and children with special educational needs. The Department is required to manage the overall school building programme such that we target and prioritise areas that are under the greatest pressure for additional school places. This reflects our fundamental objective of ensuring the availability of a school place for every child.  The Deputy may be aware there are plans for capital investment in the primary schools in the Belturbet school planning area with a view to increasing the number of mainstream and special class pupil places. In total, three school building projects in schools in the Belturbet area are at various stages of planning and delivery. At primary level, this includes plans for additional mainstream and special class provision at Milltown National School and Scoil Naomh Bríd. The overall position-----	spk_140
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	As I said, the request has been received and is being assessed. The overall position with regard to potential modernisation and the replacement of existing school infrastructure will be kept under review as capital funding allocations are clarified. The Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform will engage with other Departments on national development plan, NDP, allocations for the period 2026 to 2028 over the coming months, with allocation decisions expected during the first half of 2024. I assure the Deputy that the provision of required school places, including for children with special educational needs, is a priority for my Department. My officials will work to ensure there is sufficient provision to meet the school place needs in the schools referenced by the Deputy and in the wider school planning area. This will include a focus on any school accommodation provision that may be required in the short to medium term. As I outlined, the application for amalgamation is being reviewed and contact will be made with the patron shortly in that regard.	spk_143
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	I appreciate the Deputy's passion, absolute determination and vision for this project. The amalgamation proposal will be assessed. Contact will be made with the patron. We divide the country into 314 special school planning areas. We rely on a geographic information system, GIS, which gathers information from the Central Statistic Office, CSO, to determine future patterns of demographics. We engage with local authorities on their development plans and projections for the future, especially as regards housing developments. The information available to us says that enrolment in the Belturbet school planning area is due to peak in 2026 at 673 pupils. I understand there are seven primary schools and one post-primary school in the Belturbet school planning area. Notwithstanding that, I appreciate that both schools have come together and there is a vision locally, supported by the Deputy. Every consideration will be given to the proposal that has been made and contact will be made with the patron shortly.	spk_145
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	Since 2020, the Department of Education has invested in the region of €3.5 billion in our schools throughout the country, involving the completion of more than 690 school building projects. Construction is currently under way on more than 300 building and other projects. School building projects at construction stage involve an overall State investment of more than €1.2 billion. We also have 200 modular accommodation projects that are well advanced for delivery or at construction stage. This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities. The main focus of the Department’s resources over the past decade and for the coming period is the provision of critical additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics. I confirm to the Deputy that the Department is in receipt of an application under the additional school accommodation scheme from Corpus Christi Girls National School. The purpose of the additional school accommodation scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream and special education classroom accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school’s existing accommodation. I am pleased to confirm that the application from Corpus Christi Girls National School has been assessed and has been approved to move to the next stage. The project involves reconfiguration of the existing school and parish hall to establish two special education classes, along with two mainstream classrooms, a special education tuition room and a universal access toilet. Additionally, a request from the school's patron for a change of status to co-educational with effect from the 2024-25 school year has been approved by the Department. The parish is making the hall available to the school in question and, as such, any use of the hall as a community space is currently a matter for the parish. The hall will ultimately form part of the overall school property. In such circumstances, any use by the community in future will be a matter for the school’s board of management. In general, the priority use of school property will be for educational purposes. However, it is Department policy to support the use of school facilities for wider community usage where possible.	spk_148
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	I confirm the Deputy is correct, the building, which was the parish hall, has been closed since 2020. It will form part of the school going forward. Currently, whether it can be used by the community is a matter for the parish. When it becomes part of the school, it will be a matter for the board of management, but we have clear guidelines, which we consistently update. We recommend that facilities be made available to local communities. I am personally engaged in and supportive of that. The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, is also engaged in ensuring school facilities, especially halls, be made available to the wider community. It is the intention of the Department to progress this approved project through the project manager framework, which is designed to enable the accommodation to be provided as quickly as possible and help ease the administrative workload for school authorities in the management and delivery of projects.	spk_150
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	It is positive that the project is approved and we are moving it towards the project manager framework.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	Ensuring that every child's experience in school is positive and that children have qualified and engaged teachers available to support them in their learning is a priority. In particular, budget 2024 contains a number of measures that demonstrate my commitment to continued investment in our education system. In addition to numerous actions that have been taken in recent years to address teacher supply, a number of specific and targeted measures will be introduced with the new funding provided. A professional masters of education, PME, incentive scheme is being introduced for newly qualified teachers graduating in 2024. Those newly qualified teachers who graduate with a PME will, subject to some conditions, be eligible for an incentive payment of up to €2,000. Additionally, there will be an expansion in the number of upskilling programmes available. These programmes will increase the number of teachers who are qualified to teach in-demand subjects, including Irish, French, politics and society, and computer science, and will be in addition to the existing programmes in respect of physics, Spanish and maths. Also, an extra 1,000 posts of responsibility are being provided for in the school system for the 2024-25 school year. These new measures are in addition to other measures, for example, approving 610 additional places on initial teacher education and meeting the primary teacher initial education providers. In 2023, more than 2,700 student teachers have made themselves via registering with the Teaching Council to provide support to our schools. The operation of primary substitute teacher supply panels will continue in the 2023-24 school year, with 590 teaching posts covering almost 3,000 schools allocated. Retired teachers are being encouraged to provide substitute cover. Interestingly, an increase of more than 49% in teaching days provided by retired teachers has been noted. Restrictions preventing job sharing teachers or teachers on career breaks from working as substitutes have been removed. Ensuring that post-primary teachers can provide up to 35 additional hours of cover has also been enacted. The average student-teacher ratio in primary schools reduced by 10% between 2017 and 2023, the lowest ever seen. Teaching remains an attractive career. CAO first preference choices for post-primary teaching increased this year by 14%, which is in addition to the 9% increase last year. Many initiatives are being taken to recognise that there are challenges.	spk_154
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	I would never for one minute underestimate the challenges and difficulties in some areas. They are more heightened in some areas than in others. We are a country that is practically at full employment and the challenges we are facing in the education sector are not unique to it. They are evident in healthcare, tourism, retail and many other areas. That said, 70,000 staff are employed by the Department of Education. This is a significant figure, notwithstanding the difficult issues that arise in some instances. We have introduced a number of initiatives, for example, increasing the number of places on initial primary teacher training by 610, 2,700 student teachers being made available, a €2,000 bursary for those who wish to take up a postgraduate in teaching, 1,000 additional posts of responsibility in the system, and the upskilling of staff free of charge in particular subjects, such as Irish, French, politics and society, computer science, maths, physics and Spanish. We are not standing still. We are intent on doing all that is necessary and happy to keep everything under review in terms of additional measures.	spk_156
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	The Deputy referenced special education. We have almost 3,000 special classes operational in our system. These are deliberately kept at a low rate of one teacher and two SNAs to every six students. This is a significant measure. In addition, we have the pupil-teacher ratio at an historic low of 23:1 in our primary schools. This means that we have never had as many teachers in the system as we do now, notwithstanding the specific issues the Deputy raised. We are happy to consider flexibilities. We did so in respect of teachers who trained abroad. If they trained in an appropriate setting, they can now complete their Droichead training – their first year of qualification – in Ireland. We have introduced this flexibility. I am happy to consider the specific case the Deputy raised. I would need further information, though, so he might be happy to share it with me. We are happy to engage with schools on a one-to-one basis where they have particular staff challenges.	spk_158
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, is important legislation which has introduced a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools. The legislation is part of a suite of measures taken to take greater account of the needs of parents and students in the school system. All school admissions policies must be approved by the patron following consultation with staff and parents of children who are attending the school. The school’s admissions policy is published on the schools website. It is a key requirement of the act that all school admission policies are fair and transparent. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. The Act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion regarding their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. Section 64 of the Act prohibits the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to, or for continued enrolment, in a school. Exceptions are included in relation to fee charging post-primary schools, the boarding element in boarding schools and admission to post leaving certificate or further education courses run by post-primary schools. I am aware that my Department has received correspondence from the Deputy recently relating to a particular school that was requesting a fee to be paid upon acceptance of a place of the school. My Department contacted the school on Monday, 20 November. The school recognises that it made an error in requesting a fee from parents upon acceptance of a place in the school. The school has stated that it does not charge an admission fee, and that this fee was never intended to be a fee for enrolment. The school has never refused admission to any student based on the fact that they can or cannot afford to pay.  Further to this it stated that at no time has an offer of a place been withdrawn based on non-payment of a fee. The principal of the school concerned has confirmed that he will contact all parents that have paid this fee to arrange a refund. This process will commence this week. I would like to thank the Deputy for bringing this to our attention. I am satisfied that this practice has now ceased in the school he referenced.	spk_166
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	I appreciate that the Deputy has highlighted a very important issue. We need to reiterate that no parent can be charged for enrolment to a school or for tuition in any subject. Section 64 of the Act makes that explicitly clear.This school has said it never intended for any link to be made between enrolment and the paying of a fee. The school has categorically confirmed that it does not charge an admission fee and that the fee was never intended to be a fee for enrolment. The school has said, and it has been confirmed, that it has never refused admission to any student based on the fact the student cannot afford to pay. In this instance, as I said, immediate contact was made with the school and immediate clarity was sought. The school in question has confirmed that it will contact all parents in this regard, should there have been any misunderstanding anywhere along the line. I want to be explicit that it is not and never will be acceptable to charge any fee either for enrolment or tuition of any subject on the curriculum.	spk_168
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	I reiterate that I am very pleased the Deputy has raised this issue. It is important to state, for the record, that section 64 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 makes clear that no fee can be charged for enrolment or instruction in any subject, recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to participate. That is very clear. In this instance, the school has put its hand up following the issue raised by the Deputy and contact from the Department. It has given a commitment that it will contact all parents in regard to the issue. I have no problem whatsoever in reiterating and making it very clear that this is not acceptable practice. This is very clearly provided for in the education Act. It is not now or going forward appropriate for any fee to be charged for enrolment or tuition in any education subject on the curriculum.	spk_170
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	Under the Education Act 1998, the question of enrolment policy in individual schools, including the setting of catchment areas, is the responsibility of the board of management on behalf of the school patron. The selection process, and the enrolment policy on which it is based, must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in a particular area. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data in a way that takes account of local and regional variations, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas. School planning areas have evolved over time but, in broad terms, take account of traditional post-primary enrolment patterns, natural boundaries, census small areas and other local conditions. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that it is my Department’s intention to publish the parameters of all 314 school planning areas in the coming weeks on  The Department uses a geographical information system, GIS, to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity, is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department’s projections of school place requirements. The school under reference by the Deputy is in the Galway city school planning area, where there are a total of 11 post-primary schools. In line with the Department's demographic projections of post-primary school place requirements, there has been a continued growth in enrolments in the Galway city school planning area. In response, the Department is providing further significant additional post-primary capacity, including two new 1,000-pupil school buildings for St. Joseph's College - the Bish - and Coláiste Mhuire Máthair. Both of these projects will provide enhanced accommodation for existing schools which will provide a total of 500 additional school places above the current enrolment levels. The St. Joseph's project is at stage 2b, which is the developed design and lodgement of planning permission, while the Coláiste Mhuire Máthair is at stage 1, which is the preliminary design stage. In addition, there are a number of further school building projects at other post-primary schools across the city. Nevertheless, my Department is aware of pressures for school places at certain post-primary schools, pending the delivery of these very significant school building projects.	spk_172
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	For clarity, the Department of Education does not set out any catchment areas and we have no function in setting out catchment areas for schools. That is the preserve of the boards of management and the Department of Education has no function there. For the school referenced by the Deputy, it is my understanding that there is no catchment area designed by the board of management. Schools choose to use whatever type of enrolment mechanism, whether a lottery or otherwise, and consequently, as we do not develop catchment areas, we do not have catchment area maps in the Department. I have referenced the school planning area maps. There are 314 school planning areas in the country. We are happy to publish those maps and my understanding is that they will be published online on 	spk_174

No two schools are the same and we are very conscious of that. Individual schools have the autonomy, taking on board what are the individual circumstances in an individual area at any given time, to make their policies with regard to admission. As I said, the Department has no role in developing catchment areas. It is interesting to note that, as I understand it, this school does not have a catchment area policy.	spk_178

My officials will work to ensure there is sufficient provision to meet the school place needs in the schools referenced by the Deputy and in the wider school planning area. This will include a focus on any school accommodation provision that may be required in the short to medium term. As I outlined, the application for amalgamation is being reviewed and contact will be made with the patron shortly in that regard.	spk_143
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	Schools Amalgamation	dbsect_24	I appreciate the Deputy's passion, absolute determination and vision for this project. The amalgamation proposal will be assessed. Contact will be made with the patron. We divide the country into 314 special school planning areas. We rely on a geographic information system, GIS, which gathers information from the Central Statistic Office, CSO, to determine future patterns of demographics. We engage with local authorities on their development plans and projections for the future, especially as regards housing developments. The information available to us says that enrolment in the Belturbet school planning area is due to peak in 2026 at 673 pupils. I understand there are seven primary schools and one post-primary school in the Belturbet school planning area. Notwithstanding that, I appreciate that both schools have come together and there is a vision locally, supported by the Deputy. Every consideration will be given to the proposal that has been made and contact will be made with the patron shortly.	spk_145
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_25	Since 2020, the Department of Education has invested in the region of €3.5 billion in our schools throughout the country, involving the completion of more than 690 school building projects. Construction is currently under way on more than 300 building and other projects. School building projects at construction stage involve an overall State investment of more than €1.2 billion. We also have 200 modular accommodation projects that are well advanced for delivery or at construction stage. This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities. The main focus of the Department’s resources over the past decade and for the coming period is the provision of critical additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics. I confirm to the Deputy that the Department is in receipt of an application under the additional school accommodation scheme from Corpus Christi Girls National School. The purpose of the additional school accommodation scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream and special education classroom accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school’s existing accommodation. I am pleased to confirm that the application from Corpus Christi Girls National School has been assessed and has been approved to move to the next stage. The project involves reconfiguration of the existing school and parish hall to establish two special education classes, along with two mainstream classrooms, a special education tuition room and a universal access toilet. Additionally, a request from the school's patron for a change of status to co-educational with effect from the 2024-25 school year has been approved by the Department. The parish is making the hall available to the school in question and, as such, any use of the hall as a community space is currently a matter for the parish. The hall will ultimately form part of the overall school property. In such circumstances, any use by the community in future will be a matter for the school’s board of management. In general, the priority use of school property will be for educational purposes. However, it is Department policy to support the use of school facilities for wider community usage where possible.	spk_148
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_25	I confirm the Deputy is correct, the building, which was the parish hall, has been closed since 2020. It will form part of the school going forward. Currently, whether it can be used by the community is a matter for the parish. When it becomes part of the school, it will be a matter for the board of management, but we have clear guidelines, which we consistently update. We recommend that facilities be made available to local communities. I am personally engaged in and supportive of that. The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, is also engaged in ensuring school facilities, especially halls, be made available to the wider community. It is the intention of the Department to progress this approved project through the project manager framework, which is designed to enable the accommodation to be provided as quickly as possible and help ease the administrative workload for school authorities in the management and delivery of projects.	spk_150

In particular, budget 2024 contains a number of measures that demonstrate my commitment to continued investment in our education system. In addition to numerous actions that have been taken in recent years to address teacher supply, a number of specific and targeted measures will be introduced with the new funding provided. A professional masters of education, PME, incentive scheme is being introduced for newly qualified teachers graduating in 2024. Those newly qualified teachers who graduate with a PME will, subject to some conditions, be eligible for an incentive payment of up to €2,000. Additionally, there will be an expansion in the number of upskilling programmes available. These programmes will increase the number of teachers who are qualified to teach in-demand subjects, including Irish, French, politics and society, and computer science, and will be in addition to the existing programmes in respect of physics, Spanish and maths. Also, an extra 1,000 posts of responsibility are being provided for in the school system for the 2024-25 school year. These new measures are in addition to other measures, for example, approving 610 additional places on initial teacher education and meeting the primary teacher initial education providers. In 2023, more than 2,700 student teachers have made themselves via registering with the Teaching Council to provide support to our schools. The operation of primary substitute teacher supply panels will continue in the 2023-24 school year, with 590 teaching posts covering almost 3,000 schools allocated. Retired teachers are being encouraged to provide substitute cover. Interestingly, an increase of more than 49% in teaching days provided by retired teachers has been noted. Restrictions preventing job sharing teachers or teachers on career breaks from working as substitutes have been removed. Ensuring that post-primary teachers can provide up to 35 additional hours of cover has also been enacted. The average student-teacher ratio in primary schools reduced by 10% between 2017 and 2023, the lowest ever seen. Teaching remains an attractive career. CAO first preference choices for post-primary teaching increased this year by 14%, which is in addition to the 9% increase last year. Many initiatives are being taken to recognise that there are challenges.	spk_154
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_26	I would never for one minute underestimate the challenges and difficulties in some areas. They are more heightened in some areas than in others. We are a country that is practically at full employment and the challenges we are facing in the education sector are not unique to it. They are evident in healthcare, tourism, retail and many other areas. That said, 70,000 staff are employed by the Department of Education. This is a significant figure, notwithstanding the difficult issues that arise in some instances. We have introduced a number of initiatives, for example, increasing the number of places on initial primary teacher training by 610, 2,700 student teachers being made available, a €2,000 bursary for those who wish to take up a postgraduate in teaching, 1,000 additional posts of responsibility in the system, and the upskilling of staff free of charge in particular subjects, such as Irish, French, politics and society, computer science, maths, physics and Spanish. We are not standing still. We are intent on doing all that is necessary and happy to keep everything under review in terms of additional measures.	spk_156
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_26	The Deputy referenced special education. We have almost 3,000 special classes operational in our system. These are deliberately kept at a low rate of one teacher and two SNAs to every six students. This is a significant measure. In addition, we have the pupil-teacher ratio at an historic low of 23:1 in our primary schools. This means that we have never had as many teachers in the system as we do now, notwithstanding the specific issues the Deputy raised. We are happy to consider flexibilities. We did so in respect of teachers who trained abroad. If they trained in an appropriate setting, they can now complete their Droichead training – their first year of qualification – in Ireland. We have introduced this flexibility. I am happy to consider the specific case the Deputy raised. I would need further information, though, so he might be happy to share it with me. We are happy to engage with schools on a one-to-one basis where they have particular staff challenges.	spk_158
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_28	The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, is important legislation which has introduced a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools. The legislation is part of a suite of measures taken to take greater account of the needs of parents and students in the school system. All school admissions policies must be approved by the patron following consultation with staff and parents of children who are attending the school. The school’s admissions policy is published on the schools website. It is a key requirement of the act that all school admission policies are fair and transparent. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. The Act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion regarding their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. Section 64 of the Act prohibits the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to, or for continued enrolment, in a school. Exceptions are included in relation to fee charging post-primary schools, the boarding element in boarding schools and admission to post leaving certificate or further education courses run by post-primary schools. I am aware that my Department has received correspondence from the Deputy recently relating to a particular school that was requesting a fee to be paid upon acceptance of a place of the school. My Department contacted the school on Monday, 20 November. The school recognises that it made an error in requesting a fee from parents upon acceptance of a place in the school. The school has stated that it does not charge an admission fee, and that this fee was never intended to be a fee for enrolment. The school has never refused admission to any student based on the fact that they can or cannot afford to pay.  Further to this it stated that at no time has an offer of a place been withdrawn based on non-payment of a fee. The principal of the school concerned has confirmed that he will contact all parents that have paid this fee to arrange a refund. This process will commence this week. I would like to thank the Deputy for bringing this to our attention. I am satisfied that this practice has now ceased in the school he referenced.	spk_166
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_28	I appreciate that the Deputy has highlighted a very important issue. We need to reiterate that no parent can be charged for enrolment to a school or for tuition in any subject. Section 64 of the Act makes that explicitly clear.This school has said it never intended for any link to be made between enrolment and the paying of a fee. The school has categorically confirmed that it does not charge an admission fee and that the fee was never intended to be a fee for enrolment. The school has said, and it has been confirmed, that it has never refused admission to any student based on the fact the student cannot afford to pay. In this instance, as I said, immediate contact was made with the school and immediate clarity was sought. The school in question has confirmed that it will contact all parents in this regard, should there have been any misunderstanding anywhere along the line. I want to be explicit that it is not and never will be acceptable to charge any fee either for enrolment or tuition of any subject on the curriculum.	spk_168
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_28	I reiterate that I am very pleased the Deputy has raised this issue. It is important to state, for the record, that section 64 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 makes clear that no fee can be charged for enrolment or instruction in any subject, recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to participate. That is very clear. In this instance, the school has put its hand up following the issue raised by the Deputy and contact from the Department. It has given a commitment that it will contact all parents in regard to the issue. I have no problem whatsoever in reiterating and making it very clear that this is not acceptable practice. This is very clearly provided for in the education Act. It is not now or going forward appropriate for any fee to be charged for enrolment or tuition in any education subject on the curriculum.	spk_170
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_29	Under the Education Act 1998, the question of enrolment policy in individual schools, including the setting of catchment areas, is the responsibility of the board of management on behalf of the school patron. The selection process, and the enrolment policy on which it is based, must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in a particular area. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data in a way that takes account of local and regional variations, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas. School planning areas have evolved over time but, in broad terms, take account of traditional post-primary enrolment patterns, natural boundaries, census small areas and other local conditions. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that it is my Department’s intention to publish the parameters of all 314 school planning areas in the coming weeks on  The Department uses a geographical information system, GIS, to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity, is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department’s projections of school place requirements. The school under reference by the Deputy is in the Galway city school planning area, where there are a total of 11 post-primary schools. In line with the Department's demographic projections of post-primary school place requirements, there has been a continued growth in enrolments in the Galway city school planning area. In response, the Department is providing further significant additional post-primary capacity, including two new 1,000-pupil school buildings for St. Joseph's College - the Bish - and Coláiste Mhuire Máthair. Both of these projects will provide enhanced accommodation for existing schools which will provide a total of 500 additional school places above the current enrolment levels. The St. Joseph's project is at stage 2b, which is the developed design and lodgement of planning permission, while the Coláiste Mhuire Máthair is at stage 1, which is the preliminary design stage. In addition, there are a number of further school building projects at other post-primary schools across the city. Nevertheless, my Department is aware of pressures for school places at certain post-primary schools, pending the delivery of these very significant school building projects.	spk_172
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_29	For clarity, the Department of Education does not set out any catchment areas and we have no function in setting out catchment areas for schools. That is the preserve of the boards of management and the Department of Education has no function there. For the school referenced by the Deputy, it is my understanding that there is no catchment area designed by the board of management. Schools choose to use whatever type of enrolment mechanism, whether a lottery or otherwise, and consequently, as we do not develop catchment areas, we do not have catchment area maps in the Department. I have referenced the school planning area maps. There are 314 school planning areas in the country. We are happy to publish those maps and my understanding is that they will be published online on 	spk_174
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_29	To be fair, our geographical information system, which is based on current information from the CSO or engagement with local authorities, very much informs our projections going forward in terms of the needs in a specific area.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-11-30	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_29	Boards of management have the autonomy to develop their own unique and individual criteria. No two schools are the same and we are very conscious of that. Individual schools have the autonomy, taking on board what are the individual circumstances in an individual area at any given time, to make their policies with regard to admission. As I said, the Department has no role in developing catchment areas. It is interesting to note that, as I understand it, this school does not have a catchment area policy.	spk_178

Our thoughts are in particular with the young children and the carer who were attacked on Thursday afternoon, as well as their families and loved ones. To perpetrate such violence against any person is a grave travesty; to do so against innocent children and their carer takes the horror and indecency of what occurred to a whole new level. I have been fortunate enough to visit Gaelscoil Choláiste Mhuire on a couple of occasions since becoming Minister for Education. It is an excellent school, one which works wholeheartedly and ambitiously to serve its students and local community. The school is under the expert leadership of a dedicated principal, deputy principal, senior management and board of management, all working together with excellent staff to realise great things for the children in their care. This they do every single day. For the information of the House, where a tragic incident arises in a school, or, as in this instance, in proximity to a school, the school's critical incident plan is activated and NEPS plays a central role in supporting the school in this work. Students have now returned to the school, where they are receiving the care and attention they need from those who know them best, namely, their teachers, SNAs, secretaries, caretakers - in effect, the school community. Since the dreadful events of last Thursday, NEPS has been both on the ground in the school and in daily contact with school staff and will continue to be available for as long as is necessary. Additional staffing support has also been provided to the school to support it through this difficult time. Fundamentally, these events have pierced the bubble of comfort and innocence which we would hope to surround our children. Tragically, the unimaginable has arisen in the vicinity of this school. It will take time, continued support and dedicated care for the school and its community to recover. We must always remember the strength and unity we have in this country and the respect and affection we have children and, indeed, for education. What happened in Dublin city later on Thursday evening was nothing short of shameful. These were the actions of the few, not the actions of the many. The carer, the passersby and the members of the emergency services who intervened on Parnell Square demonstrated their selflessness, their generosity and their absolute determination to shield, protect and guard young children. That was the gut instinct of humanity by the many. It should not be overshadowed by the disgraceful actions of the few. In our hearts and minds today remain the children, the carer, their families, their school and their wider community.	spk_176

The Deputy is correct that the announcement was made for the 2023-24 school year. I am pleased to confirm that we will be launching the first phase of the programme in the coming weeks. A significant amount of work had to be undertaken and not just by our own Department. The scheme is being supported by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.

This performance has been recognised at both national and, indeed, international level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in design and specification. The Department’s approach to the decarbonisation of the school sector is predicated on establishing a credible phased pathway to zero emissions and meeting 2030 public sector targets. This will be achieved through an evidence-based approach, informed by the Department’s energy research programme, which has been in place from 1997 with 54 different research strands. The Department’s primary goal under the school building programme is to build a modern and sustainable school infrastructure that provides a learning place in a safe and inspiring physical environment for all students, now and into the future. Under Project Ireland 2040, in excess of €5 billion will be invested in school infrastructure during the period 2021 to 2025. As part of our overall approach to sustainability in the school estate, it is intended that 6 kW solar PV panels will be provided to schools. This is funded from the climate action fund, which is under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. This is really positive for our schools and will assist with their energy needs and costs, along with supporting the decarbonisation of our school buildings. The Department has been engaging regularly with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications over the last year to prepare for the roll-out of the programme. This has involved engagement around issues such as the scope of the scheme, the detail of what is included in the PV installation package and compliance with the climate action fund. The Department of Education has also been working to develop the strategic and operational management approach to ensure the scheme can be rolled out smoothly to primary and post-primary schools. This has included review of implementation strategies, procurement options and costings. The scheme will fund 6 kW of roof-mounted solar PV, which equates to approximately 16 solar panels. Connection to the grid will be included to allow unused solar energy to feed to the grid when schools are closed. This will enable schools to be compensated for renewable exports to the grid.Monitoring software will also be provided to each school, to allow review and discussion of the energy generated each day for staff and students. It is intended that the scheme will be implemented using the Department’s geographic information system, GIS, to support efficient roll-out. This will provide a user-friendly online mechanism for schools interacting with the Department on this solar scheme. This will be the first capital delivery programme of its kind to be implemented using GIS as the interface between schools and the Department. As a result, considerable work has been ongoing in my Department in developing the GIS platform and interface.
               It has been agreed in principle between the two Departments that the solar photovoltaic programme will be rolled out to schools in phases. I am pleased to advise that we remain on track to launch the first phase of the scheme this quarter and we expect all schools to have the opportunity to apply on a phased basis between quarter four 2023 and the end of 2024. Officials from my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications are currently working to finalise all details of the scheme. I look forward to being in a position to make a more detailed announcement in conjunction with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, in the coming weeks."	spk_117

We expect all schools to have the opportunity to apply on a phased basis between the quarter 4 of 2023 and the end of 2023. Officials from my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications are currently working on finalising the scheme and its details. It will be launched on a phased basis in quarter 4 of 2023. I acknowledge that this particularly innovative scheme will be the first time that capital infrastructure of this nature will be rolled out via the GIS, which will make it much more streamlined for schools and easier for them to become involved. In fairness, there has been significant development work. It was announced in budget 2023 for implementation in the 2023-24 school year.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_10	I appreciate there is unanimity from schools as well as from the House on moving this as quickly as possible. The GIS is an innovative move by the Department. It means that the uploading of quotes and streaming of applications will be done much faster. That will accelerate the delivery of the programme. On the finer detail, there is agreement that it will be done on a phased basis. The fuller detail is not entirely within the gift of my Department. We are working with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. It has been funded by the climate action fund. Further detail will be announced in the coming weeks. As I said, in quarter 4 of 2023, it will initially open, and then for all schools by 2024. I acknowledge two other aspects that are significant. There will be monitoring software as part of the system so that each school will be in a position to review and discuss their energy consumption each day, which will be a positive learning experience for both staff and students.	spk_121
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_10	The Department provides a wide range of supports to all schools, both DEIS and non-DEIS, to support the inclusion of all students and address barriers to students achieving their potential. Supplementing these universal supports, the DEIS programme provides a targeted, equitable way to address concentrated educational disadvantage that promotes equity and has benefits for students. As part of budget 2023, I secured more than€8 million to specifically enhance school attendance, participation, and retention. I had previously allocated a 5% increase in funding for the school completion programme, and in September I announced that the remaining balance of over €6 million would be committed to an attendance campaign support grant for all schools, with a higher allocation target at DEIS schools, recognising the more concentrated level of disadvantage in these schools. Schools will receive this grant this week. It will enable all schools to develop and implement targeted interventions to improve attendance and is designed to support and augment the school attendance campaign which is running through this school year. Guidance is also being issued to schools to provide advice on using available data to target supports and to provide schools with examples of good practice and initiatives that have been successful in the past. I am also pleased that in budget 2024, additional funding of €5 million is being provided for social inclusion measures, including additional educational welfare officer posts. It will also provide supports for the alternative education assessment and registration service for its work on the provision of education in places other than recognised schools, including home schooling and independent schools. A further €2 million is being made available for increasing services in school retention and completion programmes and supports targeted at the most educationally disadvantaged children. Recent engagement between my officials and some principals of schools in areas of disadvantage will help to inform the targeting of these resources. I met many of these principals myself. The Department of Education now spends approximately €180 million annually, providing additional supports to approximately 1,200 schools in the DEIS programme. This includes an additional €32 million allocated following the announcement to extend the programme to an additional 322 schools last September. This now means that approximately 240,000 students, or one in four of all students, are now supported in the programme. Within the DEIS programme, the highest levels of resources are targeted at those primary schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage. Schools in this category are accorded DEIS urban band 1 status. There are currently 306 primary schools in DEIS urban band 1, including 79 primary schools that were included in the band for the first time last September as part of the extension of the programme.	spk_123
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_10	I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from. I have met with many of these principals and heard what they have to say. I acknowledge, as we all do, that DEIS has a very significant and positive impact on our schools. We see the benefit of it but we also know two things; there are children who are at risk of educational disadvantage who are attending schools that are not DEIS schools, and there are children attending DEIS schools that are looking for models, as outlined by the Deputy, such as DEIS plus. To support us in the work we are doing, there is an OECD review. It is a significant review where we have invited the OECD project, Strength through Diversity: Education for Inclusive Societies, to review the current provision, in both DEIS and non-DEIS schools, with a view to looking at spaces and opportunities to do more, to do extra, to continue what is going well and to provide the additionality in areas where it is required. I do not doubt the earnestness, truthfulness and lived experience of the principals who have brought this to my attention. We will work through it. The first step is to have a critical and impactful review, which is being conducted by the OECD.	spk_125
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_10	There is not much the Deputy is saying that I disagree with. I have acknowledged the need for it. I have met with many of the principals who have presented their experience to me. It is important if we are to make any changes, amendments or additions to DEIS, that we have an overall look at DEIS, how it is working, where it is working well and where there are opportunities to do things differently. If I did not do that, it would also be a dereliction. We have a scheme, at a cost of more than €180 million, that we know is working well in many instances but we also know there is scope to do things differently. Those compiling the OECD report were here for a considerable period throughout the summer.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_10	I am very pleased to have secured €10.5 billion in total funding for the education budget of 2024. This significant increase in funding ensures that the total budget is at the highest ever for our primary and post-primary schools. The funding will ensure continued reduced costs for families, it will continue to tackle disadvantage, and it will provide further supports to safeguard inclusive education for all school communities. This year’s budget will provide targeted funding for school communities with an increase in cost-of-living and capitation funding of more than €81 million. The current standard rate of capitation, excluding once-off measures provided, is €183 per pupil at primary level. At post-primary, the rate is €316 per student for voluntary secondary schools. The standard capitation rates are different for community and comprehensive schools as well as those in the education and training board, ETB, sector, as these schools are funded via non-pay budget grants from the Department. As part of the cost-of-living and capitation funding package in budget 2024, I am pleased to have secured €21 million as a permanent increase in capitation funding to assist schools now and in the longer term with increased day-to-day running costs. The first-year 2024 cost of this is €7 million, as the Deputy referenced, but the full-year cost in 2025 is €21 million which, combined with €60 million in cost-of-living funding, brings the total to €81 million. This will support a permanent restoration of funding for all primary and post-primary schools from September 2024. This will bring the basic rate of capitation to €200 per student in primary schools and to €345 in voluntary secondary schools. Enhanced rates will also be paid in respect of pupils with special educational needs. This represents an increase of approximately 9.2% of current standard and enhanced capitation rates. In addition to the €21 million in the permanent base, I also secured, as I said, €60 million as part of the cost-of-living measures. All recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme will benefit from this additional capitation funding, which will be paid at an average rate of €49 per pupil at primary level and €75 at post-primary level. Enhanced rates will also be paid in respect of pupils with special educational needs. Schools also receive an ancillary services grant. The standard rate is €173 per pupil in primary schools and €224.50 per student in post-primary schools.	spk_129

Budget 2024 contains a range of measures that demonstrate the commitment to continued investment in our education system. In addition to numerous actions taken in recent years to address teacher supply, a number of specific, targeted measures will be introduced with the new funding provided in budget 2024. These include a professional masters of education incentive scheme, funding for additional teacher upskilling programmes and increasing the number of posts of responsibility. A professional masters of education, PME, incentive scheme will be introduced for newly qualified teachers graduating in May 2024. These newly qualified teachers who graduate with a PME will, subject to some conditions, be eligible for an incentive payment of up to €2,000. This incentive payment will be paid to eligible primary and post-primary teachers in 2025. It will recognise the costs that PME students incur when completing their initial teacher education, assist them with these costs and encourage suitable candidates to consider a career in teaching. Additionally, there will be an expansion in the number of upskilling programmes available. These programmes, which are free of charge to all teachers, increase the number of teachers who are qualified to teach in-demand subjects and reduce the level of out-of-field teaching. These new subjects in terms of upskilling include Irish, French, politics and society, and computer science and will be in addition to the existing upskilling programmes in maths, physics and Spanish. Also, an additional 1,000 posts of responsibility will be provided in the school system for the 2024-25 school year. This is in recognition of school leaders and of the role they play in improving educational outcomes by creating a positive school climate and environment, as well as motivating and empowering educators and learners within their school communities. These new measures are in addition to a range of targeted measures that I have already introduced in recent times, including at primary level my approval of 610 additional places on initial teacher education programmes for this and the next academic year. I recently met with the primary teacher initial education providers on continuing existing flexibilities that enable student teachers to support schools, either while on placement, or in a substitute capacity. In 2023, more than 2,700 student teachers registered with the Teaching Council and provided valuable support to schools as substitute teachers.	spk_143
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_10	I acknowledge the Deputy's proactive engagement in this space. We recognise that we are at near full employment and that there are challenges within the education sector, similar to challenges we have in the hospitality or business sector - you name the sector and there are challenges. I acknowledge that should not in any way diminish the particular challenges that a principal might have and face at a given time in terms of teacher availability. It is more acute in some areas than in others. Specifically regarding the PME and the two-year aspect, in the first instance I have visited an awful lot of schools and met an awful lot of student teachers and one of the key issues highlighted to me is the cost. Because of the cost we introduced this €2,000 support for PME graduates and that is a very positive step forward. We keep everything under review but I am conscious, and everybody in this House knows, that more and more is being asked now of teachers. They are asked to be qualified in so many different aspects: special education; relationship sexuality education, RSE; social, personal and health education, SPHE; the curricular subjects they teach, and so much more. It is a significant demand on them and it was for that reason it was extended in the first place to two years but we keep everything under review.	spk_145
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_10	There are a number of routes into teaching as the Deputy is aware. Recognising the issue around the PME route and the expense of it, I have already outlined the €2,000 support there. I want to acknowledge the 3,500 teachers graduating every year. It is very significant. I have also increased the number of places on the initial teacher education programmes by more than 600 over two years. There were 2,700 student teachers last year who registered with the Teaching Council. We have never had such a high level of registrations with the Teaching Council in terms of student teachers making themselves available. Restrictions across a whole variety of schemes, whether it is the job-sharing schemes, have been lifted. There is a waiver of abatement for retired teachers. We have looked at teachers at post-primary level who wish to teach additional hours and they can do so and be recompensed for it. We have looked at teacher sharing schemes and as I said we looked at posts of responsibility because again it is a pathway towards furthering oneself in one's career and 1,000 additional posts have been made available there. There are also the PME schemes and the upskilling programmes. I know these work. I attended a graduation in University of Limerick, UL, a couple of weeks ago where more than 100 teachers graduated in maths.	spk_148
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_10	The school transport scheme is a significant operation, as the Deputy is aware. It is managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the 2022-23 school year more than 149,000 children, including more than 18,000 children with special educational needs, were transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. In addition, school transport scheme services were provided in the 2022-23 school year for more than 5,400 children who arrived to Ireland from Ukraine.The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was in excess of €338.9 million. As part of the budget measures for 2024, the Government announced an additional €50 million for school transport which will allow continued investment for children to access the school transport scheme. The increased investment in the scheme is due in the main to the cost of contractors to cater for the increase in pupil numbers projected in 2024. In addition, the expected increase in the scheme for children with special educational needs will result in a subsequent increase in the number of school bus escorts required. This is factored into the additional costs for 2024. Alongside this €50 million in funding for investment in the overall scheme, a further €42 million was provided as part of the cost-of-living measures announced in budget 2024. This funding will be used to assist families with the costs of education. Reduced fees will continue to apply to school transport for the 2024-25 academic year. All funding for the school transport scheme for 2024 will be derived from core or current funding and not capital funding. There has been a significant overall increase year on year in school transport applications and tickets issued. In 2017, the number of children availing of primary, post-primary and special educational needs transport was 116,000. However, the number of children availing of school transport in the current year has increased to approximately 152,000, an increase of 31%. As with most, if not all, Government schemes, there are criteria governing the operation of the scheme. Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest primary school and, at post-primary level, not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school or education centre. Any pupils or students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible - otherwise known as concessionary applicants - and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.	spk_151
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_10	I and every Member of the House, particularly Deputies from rural constituencies, appreciate the importance of the school transport system. It is for this reason that the system is underpinned by significant funding, with almost €339 million expended last year. An additional €50 million has been provided this year to ensure greater access and to allow children to avail of school transport. This is increased investment is due in the main to the cost of contractors to cater for the increase in pupil numbers projected in 2024. We provided €42 million to keep the cost of school transport at a reduced rate, which is an important consideration for families. As with any scheme, there must be criteria and the criteria have not changed. Students who were eligible under these criteria received a seat on a school bus, while those who were not eligible under the criteria could, if fortunate, receive a not eligible or concessionary ticket. The criteria have been unchanged for the last number of years and they have been abundantly clear.	spk_153
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_10	To be clear, there are eligibility criteria. Pupils who live 3.2 km from their nearest primary school or 4.8 km from their nearest or next nearest post-primary school are eligible. In relation to one child getting a ticket and the other sibling not getting one, if both children are eligible, both will get a ticket. However, if they are not eligible, concessionary tickets are provided by lottery under the present system. A considerable body of work has been undertaken in relation to the review. This is a demand-led service, which is important. The review involved engagement with our European counterparts, bus providers, parents and guardians of children who are utilising the service and students, as well as with those who are not utilising the system but would like to do so. The work is drawing to a close and will be published shortly. It will give us a pathway forward. I want to be clear that this will demand considerable resources, bearing in mind that what the current system is resourced to the tune of €339 million.	spk_155
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Environmental Schemes	dbsect_11	"At the outset, I want to confirm that my Department has a very strong record with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings. This performance has been recognised at both national and, indeed, international level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in design and specification. The Department’s approach to the decarbonisation of the school sector is predicated on establishing a credible phased pathway to zero emissions and meeting 2030 public sector targets. This will be achieved through an evidence-based approach, informed by the Department’s energy research programme, which has been in place from 1997 with 54 different research strands. The Department’s primary goal under the school building programme is to build a modern and sustainable school infrastructure that provides a learning place in a safe and inspiring physical environment for all students, now and into the future. Under Project Ireland 2040, in excess of €5 billion will be invested in school infrastructure during the period 2021 to 2025. As part of our overall approach to sustainability in the school estate, it is intended that 6 kW solar PV panels will be provided to schools. This is funded from the climate action fund, which is under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. This is really positive for our schools and will assist with their energy needs and costs, along with supporting the decarbonisation of our school buildings. The Department has been engaging regularly with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications over the last year to prepare for the roll-out of the programme. This has involved engagement around issues such as the scope of the scheme, the detail of what is included in the PV installation package and compliance with the climate action fund. The Department of Education has also been working to develop the strategic and operational management approach to ensure the scheme can be rolled out smoothly to primary and post-primary schools. This has included review of implementation strategies, procurement options and costings. The scheme will fund 6 kW of roof-mounted solar PV, which equates to approximately 16 solar panels. Connection to the grid will be included to allow unused solar energy to feed to the grid when schools are closed. This will enable schools to be compensated for renewable exports to the grid.Monitoring software will also be provided to each school, to allow review and discussion of the energy generated each day for staff and students. It is intended that the scheme will be implemented using the Department’s geographic information system, GIS, to support efficient roll-out. This will provide a user-friendly online mechanism for schools interacting with the Department on this solar scheme. This will be the first capital delivery programme of its kind to be implemented using GIS as the interface between schools and the Department. As a result, considerable work has been ongoing in my Department in developing the GIS platform and interface.
               It has been agreed in principle between the two Departments that the solar photovoltaic programme will be rolled out to schools in phases. I am pleased to advise that we remain on track to launch the first phase of the scheme this quarter and we expect all schools to have the opportunity to apply on a phased basis between quarter four 2023 and the end of 2024. Officials from my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications are currently working to finalise all details of the scheme. I look forward to being in a position to make a more detailed announcement in conjunction with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, in the coming weeks."	spk_117

It will be launched on a phased basis in quarter 4 of 2023. I acknowledge that this particularly innovative scheme will be the first time that capital infrastructure of this nature will be rolled out via the GIS, which will make it much more streamlined for schools and easier for them to become involved. In fairness, there has been significant development work. It was announced in budget 2023 for implementation in the 2023-24 school year. I am pleased to confirm that the first phase of that will be rolled out before Christmas.	spk_119

The GIS is an innovative move by the Department. It means that the uploading of quotes and streaming of applications will be done much faster. That will accelerate the delivery of the programme. On the finer detail, there is agreement that it will be done on a phased basis. The fuller detail is not entirely within the gift of my Department. We are working with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. It has been funded by the climate action fund. Further detail will be announced in the coming weeks. As I said, in quarter 4 of 2023, it will initially open, and then for all schools by 2024. I acknowledge two other aspects that are significant. There will be monitoring software as part of the system so that each school will be in a position to review and discuss their energy consumption each day, which will be a positive learning experience for both staff and students.	spk_121
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_12	The Department provides a wide range of supports to all schools, both DEIS and non-DEIS, to support the inclusion of all students and address barriers to students achieving their potential. Supplementing these universal supports, the DEIS programme provides a targeted, equitable way to address concentrated educational disadvantage that promotes equity and has benefits for students. As part of budget 2023, I secured more than€8 million to specifically enhance school attendance, participation, and retention. I had previously allocated a 5% increase in funding for the school completion programme, and in September I announced that the remaining balance of over €6 million would be committed to an attendance campaign support grant for all schools, with a higher allocation target at DEIS schools, recognising the more concentrated level of disadvantage in these schools. Schools will receive this grant this week. It will enable all schools to develop and implement targeted interventions to improve attendance and is designed to support and augment the school attendance campaign which is running through this school year. Guidance is also being issued to schools to provide advice on using available data to target supports and to provide schools with examples of good practice and initiatives that have been successful in the past. I am also pleased that in budget 2024, additional funding of €5 million is being provided for social inclusion measures, including additional educational welfare officer posts. It will also provide supports for the alternative education assessment and registration service for its work on the provision of education in places other than recognised schools, including home schooling and independent schools. A further €2 million is being made available for increasing services in school retention and completion programmes and supports targeted at the most educationally disadvantaged children. Recent engagement between my officials and some principals of schools in areas of disadvantage will help to inform the targeting of these resources. I met many of these principals myself. The Department of Education now spends approximately €180 million annually, providing additional supports to approximately 1,200 schools in the DEIS programme. This includes an additional €32 million allocated following the announcement to extend the programme to an additional 322 schools last September. This now means that approximately 240,000 students, or one in four of all students, are now supported in the programme. Within the DEIS programme, the highest levels of resources are targeted at those primary schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage. Schools in this category are accorded DEIS urban band 1 status. There are currently 306 primary schools in DEIS urban band 1, including 79 primary schools that were included in the band for the first time last September as part of the extension of the programme.	spk_123
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_12	I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from. I have met with many of these principals and heard what they have to say. I acknowledge, as we all do, that DEIS has a very significant and positive impact on our schools. We see the benefit of it but we also know two things; there are children who are at risk of educational disadvantage who are attending schools that are not DEIS schools, and there are children attending DEIS schools that are looking for models, as outlined by the Deputy, such as DEIS plus. To support us in the work we are doing, there is an OECD review. It is a significant review where we have invited the OECD project, Strength through Diversity: Education for Inclusive Societies, to review the current provision, in both DEIS and non-DEIS schools, with a view to looking at spaces and opportunities to do more, to do extra, to continue what is going well and to provide the additionality in areas where it is required. I do not doubt the earnestness, truthfulness and lived experience of the principals who have brought this to my attention. We will work through it. The first step is to have a critical and impactful review, which is being conducted by the OECD.	spk_125
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_12	There is not much the Deputy is saying that I disagree with. I have acknowledged the need for it. I have met with many of the principals who have presented their experience to me. It is important if we are to make any changes, amendments or additions to DEIS, that we have an overall look at DEIS, how it is working, where it is working well and where there are opportunities to do things differently. If I did not do that, it would also be a dereliction. We have a scheme, at a cost of more than €180 million, that we know is working well in many instances but we also know there is scope to do things differently. Those compiling the OECD report were here for a considerable period throughout the summer. They engaged with a number of different schools, principals, and a number of different bodies, agencies and organisations on how we can do things differently. It will be an independent report that will be completed as quickly as possible.

It will recognise the costs that PME students incur when completing their initial teacher education, assist them with these costs and encourage suitable candidates to consider a career in teaching. Additionally, there will be an expansion in the number of upskilling programmes available. These programmes, which are free of charge to all teachers, increase the number of teachers who are qualified to teach in-demand subjects and reduce the level of out-of-field teaching. These new subjects in terms of upskilling include Irish, French, politics and society, and computer science and will be in addition to the existing upskilling programmes in maths, physics and Spanish. Also, an additional 1,000 posts of responsibility will be provided in the school system for the 2024-25 school year. This is in recognition of school leaders and of the role they play in improving educational outcomes by creating a positive school climate and environment, as well as motivating and empowering educators and learners within their school communities. These new measures are in addition to a range of targeted measures that I have already introduced in recent times, including at primary level my approval of 610 additional places on initial teacher education programmes for this and the next academic year. I recently met with the primary teacher initial education providers on continuing existing flexibilities that enable student teachers to support schools, either while on placement, or in a substitute capacity. In 2023, more than 2,700 student teachers registered with the Teaching Council and provided valuable support to schools as substitute teachers.	spk_143
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_14	I acknowledge the Deputy's proactive engagement in this space. We recognise that we are at near full employment and that there are challenges within the education sector, similar to challenges we have in the hospitality or business sector - you name the sector and there are challenges. I acknowledge that should not in any way diminish the particular challenges that a principal might have and face at a given time in terms of teacher availability. It is more acute in some areas than in others. Specifically regarding the PME and the two-year aspect, in the first instance I have visited an awful lot of schools and met an awful lot of student teachers and one of the key issues highlighted to me is the cost. Because of the cost we introduced this €2,000 support for PME graduates and that is a very positive step forward. We keep everything under review but I am conscious, and everybody in this House knows, that more and more is being asked now of teachers. They are asked to be qualified in so many different aspects: special education; relationship sexuality education, RSE; social, personal and health education, SPHE; the curricular subjects they teach, and so much more. It is a significant demand on them and it was for that reason it was extended in the first place to two years but we keep everything under review.	spk_145
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_14	There are a number of routes into teaching as the Deputy is aware. Recognising the issue around the PME route and the expense of it, I have already outlined the €2,000 support there. I want to acknowledge the 3,500 teachers graduating every year. It is very significant. I have also increased the number of places on the initial teacher education programmes by more than 600 over two years. There were 2,700 student teachers last year who registered with the Teaching Council. We have never had such a high level of registrations with the Teaching Council in terms of student teachers making themselves available. Restrictions across a whole variety of schemes, whether it is the job-sharing schemes, have been lifted. There is a waiver of abatement for retired teachers. We have looked at teachers at post-primary level who wish to teach additional hours and they can do so and be recompensed for it. We have looked at teacher sharing schemes and as I said we looked at posts of responsibility because again it is a pathway towards furthering oneself in one's career and 1,000 additional posts have been made available there. There are also the PME schemes and the upskilling programmes. I know these work. I attended a graduation in University of Limerick, UL, a couple of weeks ago where more than 100 teachers graduated in maths.	spk_148
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_15	The school transport scheme is a significant operation, as the Deputy is aware. It is managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the 2022-23 school year more than 149,000 children, including more than 18,000 children with special educational needs, were transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. In addition, school transport scheme services were provided in the 2022-23 school year for more than 5,400 children who arrived to Ireland from Ukraine.The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was in excess of €338.9 million. As part of the budget measures for 2024, the Government announced an additional €50 million for school transport which will allow continued investment for children to access the school transport scheme. The increased investment in the scheme is due in the main to the cost of contractors to cater for the increase in pupil numbers projected in 2024. In addition, the expected increase in the scheme for children with special educational needs will result in a subsequent increase in the number of school bus escorts required. This is factored into the additional costs for 2024. Alongside this €50 million in funding for investment in the overall scheme, a further €42 million was provided as part of the cost-of-living measures announced in budget 2024. This funding will be used to assist families with the costs of education. Reduced fees will continue to apply to school transport for the 2024-25 academic year. All funding for the school transport scheme for 2024 will be derived from core or current funding and not capital funding. There has been a significant overall increase year on year in school transport applications and tickets issued. In 2017, the number of children availing of primary, post-primary and special educational needs transport was 116,000. However, the number of children availing of school transport in the current year has increased to approximately 152,000, an increase of 31%. As with most, if not all, Government schemes, there are criteria governing the operation of the scheme. Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest primary school and, at post-primary level, not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school or education centre. Any pupils or students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible - otherwise known as concessionary applicants - and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.	spk_151
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_15	I and every Member of the House, particularly Deputies from rural constituencies, appreciate the importance of the school transport system. It is for this reason that the system is underpinned by significant funding, with almost €339 million expended last year. An additional €50 million has been provided this year to ensure greater access and to allow children to avail of school transport. This is increased investment is due in the main to the cost of contractors to cater for the increase in pupil numbers projected in 2024. We provided €42 million to keep the cost of school transport at a reduced rate, which is an important consideration for families. As with any scheme, there must be criteria and the criteria have not changed. Students who were eligible under these criteria received a seat on a school bus, while those who were not eligible under the criteria could, if fortunate, receive a not eligible or concessionary ticket. The criteria have been unchanged for the last number of years and they have been abundantly clear.	spk_153
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_15	To be clear, there are eligibility criteria. Pupils who live 3.2 km from their nearest primary school or 4.8 km from their nearest or next nearest post-primary school are eligible. In relation to one child getting a ticket and the other sibling not getting one, if both children are eligible, both will get a ticket. However, if they are not eligible, concessionary tickets are provided by lottery under the present system. A considerable body of work has been undertaken in relation to the review. This is a demand-led service, which is important. The review involved engagement with our European counterparts, bus providers, parents and guardians of children who are utilising the service and students, as well as with those who are not utilising the system but would like to do so. The work is drawing to a close and will be published shortly. It will give us a pathway forward. I want to be clear that this will demand considerable resources, bearing in mind that what the current system is resourced to the tune of €339 million.	spk_155
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	I confirm to the Deputy that an application for major capital funding has been received from the school in question. There are significant demand pressures on the school system at present arising from demographic growth, the need to align school place provision with housing developments, increased demand for special educational needs provision and the accommodation of children from Ukraine. Under Project Ireland 2040, in excess of €5 billion will be invested in school infrastructure during the period 2021 to 2025. The Deputy will appreciate the Department's priority in recent years has been providing additional capacity to ensure that every child has a school place, including children with special educational needs, and this continues to be the case.  The application from the school in question was assessed under the additional school accommodation, ASA, scheme. The purpose of the ASA scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom and special educational needs, SEN, accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school's existing accommodation. At primary level, this situation generally arises to cater for a school's accommodation requirements where an additional teaching post has been sanctioned by my Department, or a new special class has been sanctioned by the National Council for Special Education, and all available alternative accommodation within the school is already being used for classroom purposes. The Department has indicated to the school authority in question that it is willing to provide modular accommodation for a special education teaching room at the school. The Department awaits a reply from the school authorities in relation to this. It is also open to the school in question to apply for my Department's emergency works scheme, which will consider applications for funding to address any immediate health and safety issues. The main focus of my Department's capital allocation over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of critical additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics. The Department is required to manage the overall school building programme so that we target and prioritise areas that are under greatest pressure for additional school places. This reflects our fundamental objective of ensuring the availability of a school place for every child. The Department has a strong track record of project delivery. From 2018 to 2022, nearly 900 school building projects were completed under a variety of delivery mechanisms. Some 300 projects are under construction during 2023, of which 40 are new school buildings. The overall position with regard to potential modernisation and upgrade of existing infrastructure will be kept under review as capital funding allocations are clarified.	spk_157
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	I appreciate the Deputy’s advocacy for the school. The Department has made an offer to the school in respect of a special education teaching room. We await the school’s engagement on that. For any issues that might be regarded as an emergency and for some of the issues the Deputy mentioned, there is a very clear pathway to make emergency funding made readily available to schools if there is a need. I do not want there to be any doubt about that. As I said, we keep everything under review in the context of the capital envelope we have. More than 300 buildings are at various stages of construction, of which 40 are new school buildings. In the coming months, the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform will engage with other Departments, including my Department, on NDP allocations for the 2026-28 period, with allocation decisions expected during the first half of 2024. In the interim, my Department will continue to engage with the authorities of the school in question with respect to accommodation needs.	spk_159
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	The Deputy has highlighted a short-term and a long-term vision for the school. I restate that if there is any issue with safety that is causing difficulty in the school, the way forward is through the emergency works scheme, which will be made available to the school to meet its needs. Provision is being made for special education teaching, which is positive. We have an ambitious building programme, with over 300 school buildings at different stages of development. The programme is kept under constant review. I spoke of our engagement with Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform on the NDP and its allocations. We should have some word on that in early to mid-2024. In the interim, I am very happy for my Department to continue to engage with the school in question.	spk_161
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	I thank the Deputy for the question. I know it is an area on which he has advocated very strongly. I am very pleased that the counselling pilot has been well received. The Department of Education is committed to supporting the emotional well-being of our children and I am pleased to provide an update on the significant progress that has been made on strands 1 and 2 of the pilot in almost 650 primary schools across the country. I am also pleased to announce that the Department has secured additional funding in budget 2024 to continue the pilot for an additional year, until June 2025. The pilot includes two strands. Strand 1 will see the provision of one-to-one counselling to support a small number of children in all primary schools in counties Cavan, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Monaghan and Tipperary. Considerable work has been undertaken to identify suitably qualified, experienced and accredited counsellors. In the absence of a single recognised counselling qualification and a national regulatory body for counselling in Ireland at this time, the Department initially liaised with the three largest accrediting bodies for counsellors in Ireland, namely, the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, IACP, the Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI, and the Irish Association of Humanistic and Integrative Psychotherapists in Ireland, IAHIP. The Department has subsequently liaised with additional associations and is now also accepting applications from counsellors accredited with the Irish Association of Psychotherapy and Play Therapy, IAPPT, the Association of Child Art Psychotherapists, ACAP, and those registered with the Irish Council for Psychotherapy, ICP. Due to the highly sensitive nature of providing counselling for children, the application and vetting process for these counsellors requires significant time and attention in order to ensure the highest quality in this landmark pilot project. However, I am very pleased to advise that we will be in touch with schools in the coming weeks in relation to the initial allocation of counselling hours to schools. Schools, in consultation with a NEPS psychologist, and guided by the Department of Education’s continuum of support, will identify the children who may benefit most from this counselling service, which will be subject to parental or legal guardian informed consent. Strand 2 will see the establishment of a new type of support to schools from education well-being teams and the introduction of well-being practitioners to support clusters of schools in Cork, Carlow, Dublin 7 and Dublin 16.	spk_163
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	We are all aware that this initiative will be of enormous benefit and support to our primary schools and their staff who do tremendous work every day. We know there is a growing need in the area of well-being. I am pleased that we have secured additional funding in budget 2024 to ensure the scheme can run longer than was envisaged originally. Two different schemes will run. Counsellors will be available to schools, as I already outlined, and, in the second strand, education well-being teams and practitioners will be introduced. When we have an opportunity to analyse both schemes , we will learn a great deal about what we need to do in future and what the best approach will be, whether it is one or other strand or a combination of both. It is a significant departure and a landmark for the Department to do this and it is right that we do it.	spk_165
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	Regarding NEPS, I want to be 100% clear. There is no cut - absolutely none - in the NEPS funding made available this year. What has happened, which was clarified, is that the heading under which payments such as salaries, etc., for NEPS are made has been moved to a different subhead. There has been no cut whatsoever in NEPS funding. I welcome the very positive endorsement many Members have given to the roll-out of this programme. There has also been a very positive endorsement from schools. Reference was made to play therapists. The Department has liaised with additional associations and is now accepting applications from counsellors accredited by the IAPTP and the ACAP and those registered with the ICP. Any involvement of a young person in this scheme will have to be signed off by a parent or legal guardian, as would always be the case. On the different strands, strand 1 is counsellor-led and strand 2 involves well-being practitioners. Well-being practitioners in strand 2 have been interviewed and positions offered. We anticipate that these graduates in psychology, for example, or social care, will be employed in the four pilot areas in the coming weeks. They will initially receive additional training from NEPS psychologists.	spk_171
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	I am pleased the Deputy has brought this matter to my attention because there seems to be some confusion. In order to respond to the issue raised, it is important to clarify the distinction between a sensory room, which serves a whole school, and a calming space within a classroom, which may be used by students within a specific classroom. I say this only for the record because I know the Deputy is well aware of it. A sensory room in a school can enhance and promote the health and well-being of the whole school, with a focus on both the culture and environment. It is a designated area within a school which can support a student’s sensory preferences and needs and provide students with the individualised sensory input they need to self-regulate, so they can be better prepared for learning and interacting with others. Funding of €7,000 is made available by the Department's loose furniture and equipment section for the provision of the start-up of a sensory room within a school. In order to be eligible for the grant, the school must demonstrate that it has a National Council for Special Education, NCSE, approved autism spectrum disorder, ASD, class and that there is a suitable room to house the sensory room. The sensory room must be a separate room from that of the ASD class and must have its own separate entry and exit. Only one sensory room grant is funded by the Department per school. In addition to a sensory room, a school may have a calming space, the design of which is very different from a sensory room. The calming space should be located within or directly off the classroom base and is intended as a safe, quiet area that a pupil, under the supervision of a staff member, can access for a short period of time if they need some quiet time to themselves The design of the space must allow staff to observe pupils unobtrusively from the classroom. The calming space is designed to ensure that a student may choose to access it to take a break or to help with regulation. Calming activities are made available to the student depending on their individual needs and preferences and may include items such as stress balls, books, soft toys and-or noise-cancelling headphones. The calming space is to be designed as a quiet zone or alcove within the classroom without enclosing walls and not as a separate room. These spaces may involve an area of the classroom set up with cushions or a tent to limit sensory stimuli or a space with calming activities and materials which is visible to either a teacher or a special needs assistant.	spk_173
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	I want to be very clear that there is a distinction between the two. The sensory room is a room open to the entire school. The quiet space is contained within a given classroom at a given time. It is supervised by the existing teacher and-or an SNA. With regard to the specific case raised by the Deputy, I emphasise that the Department has not refused a grant to equip a sensory room. The school applied for funding in relation to a calming space - not a sensory room - within a classroom, which does not qualify for the sensory room start-up grant funding. It applied for funding for a calming space, not for a sensory room. A special educational needs classroom has also been approved for the school under the Department’s modular programme, which is currently in train. The Department provides start-up funding of €6,500 for each SEN classroom. This funding can be used by the school in question to purchase furniture and equipment for a calming space if it so wishes. In addition to this funding, the option remains open to the school to apply for a sensory room start-up grant if the school has not previously received such a grant and has a suitable space available. The application will need to include the drawings or whatever else is required. It is open to the school to make such an application.	spk_175
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	I will be very clear; my Department has engaged with the school and has communicated the information I imparted to the Deputy to the principal of the school in question. We would be more than pleased to engage with the principal on an ongoing basis to satisfy the needs presented. However, let me be very clear that there is no ambiguity. I visit schools all of the time and this has never been raised with me before. Schools are very clear on the distinction between calming spaces, which are located within classroom settings, and sensory rooms. Sensory rooms are open to the entire school and therefore must be independent and distinct. Calming spaces are within the students' classroom. I am at a loss to understand where the difficulty arose here. Be that as it may, difficulties and misunderstandings can arise. The Department has proactively reached out to the school. We are very happy to work with it in whatever respect is required.	spk_177

Tá céimeanna glactha ag mo Roinn chun an gealltanas atá i gclár an Rialtais maidir le polasaí agus straitéis don Ghaeilge sa chóras oideachais a chomhlíonadh le dúthracht. Tá an obair seo á cur chun cinn i gcomhthéacs chuspóirí na straitéise 20-bliain don Ghaeilge. Ó foilsíodh é, tá an polasaí don oideachas Gaeltachta tar éis oideachas trí mheán na Gaeilge a neartú i gceantair Ghaeltachta. Faoin bpolasaí sin, tá tacaíocht láidir tugtha ag mo Roinn do scoileanna Gaeltachta tríd an scéim aitheantais. Tá critéir theanga leagtha amach do na scoileanna chun a chinntiú go bhfuil oideachas den scoth á chur ar fáil acu trí mheán na Gaeilge. Chun tacú leis an obair seo: cuirtear deontas ar fáil dóibh chun ábhair a cheannach; faigheann siad uaireanta tacaíochta teanga don Ghaeilge bunaithe ar rollú na scoile; baineann siad leas as cuairteanna comhairleacha ón gcigireacht; agus tugann an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta, COGG, tacaíocht ghairmiúil dóibh chomh maith. Tríd an tionscadal e-hub do scoileanna Gaeltachta, tá scoláirí anois ag déanamh staidéir ar an fhisic agus ar an cheimic don ardteistiméireacht trí fhoghlaim ar líne. Ní raibh sé seo ar fáil dóibh roimhe seo. Chomh maith, tá infheistíocht déanta againn faoin bpolasaí chun soláthar na múinteoirí atá in ann oibriú go héifeachtach trí Ghaeilge a mhéadú. Is féidir tionchar dearfach an pholasaí a mhothú i scoileanna agus i bpobail ar fud na Gaeltachta. Tá obair faoi lán seoil i mo Roinn chun polasaí nua a fhorbairt don oideachas lán-Ghaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht freisin. Tógann an polasaí nua seo ar a bhfuil bainte amach ag an bpolasaí don oideachas Gaeltachta. Is céim thábhachtach eile i dtreo cuspóirí chlár an Rialtais a bhaint amach é seo. Bunaíodh coiste stiúrtha le hionadaithe ó na Ranna agus ó na gníomhaireachtaí Rialtais chun maoirseacht a dhéanamh ar fhorbairt an pholasaí.  A public consultation process has been conducted to gather the views of stakeholders, including young people, parents, educational professionals, education stakeholders and Irish language organisations. There were three phases in the consultation comprising an online questionnaire, a call for written submissions and a series of focus groups and bilateral meetings between the Department and stakeholders.	spk_179
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	To give some detail on what is happening in the process, which is quite involved, SEALBHÚ, the research centre in Dublin City University, DCU, is currently carrying out an analysis of all of the information that has been gathered throughout the process. The reports will be shared with the steering committee and with the interdepartmental working group in due course. A number of actions are being taken to ensure that the new policy will be informed by current research. A review of national and international literature has been commissioned through a public procurement process and is being carried out by SEALBHÚ at DCU. A report giving an overview of provision for Irish-medium education outside of Gaeltacht areas was compiled and published by the Department. Research on Irish-medium aonaid and sruthanna in English-medium schools is being carried out. Two composite reports on inspection findings on the quality of education provision in Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí were published in spring 2021. These reports provide a helpful insight into practice in schools. A report on inspection findings from visits to Irish-medium early learning and care settings is also being prepared. I am really pleased with the level of interest that has been demonstrated in the consultation to date and with the number of responses received. I look forward to progressing the important work of strengthening Irish-medium education provision and building on the positive outcomes already being achieved in the implementation of the policy on Gaeltacht education.	spk_181

As the Deputy will be aware, the validation process commenced in October 2022. Recognition as a Gaeltacht school will be awarded to a school when it is confirmed that the school's practice has been developed in accordance with the language-based criteria. As the Deputy has outlined, the process involves a visit from the inspectorate to schools participating in the scheme to assess their progress in implementing the criteria. The visit includes input from school staff, students and parents' representatives. Following the visit, the inspector writes a report on the detailed findings of the evaluation. The school is then given an opportunity to verify the facts in the report and to respond to it. It is therefore quite an involved process but it is important that, on foot of the inspectorate's visit, the school is given an opportunity to reply. It is expected that the inspectors' evaluations will be entirely completed by Easter 2024. Over half of the schools in the scheme have received an evaluation visit to date. Official recognition has not been awarded to any school yet as the process is ongoing. Schools will be contacted in due course as regards the outcome of the validation process. It is likely that the first batch of results under the validation process will be received by schools prior to Christmas.	spk_183
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	The school transport scheme is a significant operation and, as the Deputy will be aware, it is managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the 2022-23 school year, over 149,000 young people, including over 18,000 children with special educational needs, were transported to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country every day. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year for over 5,400 children who have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €338.9 million. There has been an overall increase in the numbers of both applications and tickets issued for the 2023-24 school year in comparison to the 2022-23 school year.Under the current terms of the scheme, pupils at primary level are eligible where they live not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post-primary level, students who live not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school are deemed eligible. Any pupils or students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for. Temporary alleviation measures, TAMs, at post-primary level are being continued for the current school year. Undoubtedly, the school transport scheme is of enormous importance in terms of encouraging the use of public transport and taking cars off the road. It also brings significant benefit in the area of congestion and traffic management in towns and villages. Considering how to best maximise these benefits now and into the future has been a significant factor in the ongoing review of the scheme. The review has been conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. This review has built upon the commitments within the programme for Government, as they relate to school transport, including examining options to reduce car journeys and assessing how the school transport scheme can work in liaison with the safe routes to schools programme. The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications was on the membership of the steering group for the review and its input and views on how the school transport scheme can support climate action targets have been included in the final report. It is also important to note that officials from my Department also engage regularly with their counterparts in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the development of the climate action plan, CAP, both the current CAP 23 and the forthcoming CAP 24.	spk_186
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	I know Deputy O'Rourke has an enormous interest in this area, both from the climate action point of view and from recognising the importance of the benefit of the school transport scheme. He is quite correct that there was an interim review and a final review. Phase 1 of the review was completed in June 2021 and examined the impact of eligibility criteria for the scheme on mainstream pupils who were eligible for transport to their nearest school but attending their next nearest school. The steering group presented me with that report and, following consideration of the report, the Deputy will be aware that we introduced the TAMs for students who are attending not just their nearest post-primary school but their next nearest. These measures have been continued for 2022 to 2023. There has been a significant body of work in terms of engagement with parents, students, providers, those who do not use the scheme, and looking at best practice with our European counterparts. It is my expectation that it will be published shortly, but prior to that it has to go to the Government, and then it will be published. That is quite imminent.	spk_188
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	A key aspect of the review is that we would be very much within our climate action targets. The climate action plan includes a specific target to increase the number of journeys being taken using sustainable travel, whether it is cycling, walking or sustainable public transport by an additional 125,000 journeys by 2025 and a 30% shift in escort-to-education car journeys to more sustainable modes of transport by 2030. By that I mean people driving children to school or whatever. The plan also requires Ireland to achieve a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions not later than 2050. Encouraging greater uptake of school transport scheme services can support the achievement of these targets. That involves looking at everything in the most holistic way, whether it is the fleet itself or encouraging more people to engage in it and meeting our climate action targets.	spk_190
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	Through Project Ireland 2040, over the period 2021-25, in excess of €5 billion will be invested in upgrading school facilities across the country for the almost 1 million students and more than 100,000 staff members who learn and work in our schools every day. The Department has approved a large-scale building project for the school to which the Deputy refers. He has advocated very strongly on an ongoing basis for this school. The project involves the provision of a new-build extension and alterations to the existing school buildings that will provide modern school facilities and cater for an enrolment of 300 students. The project has been devolved for delivery to Cork Education and Training Board, ETB, and has recently been approved to move to stage 2B of the architectural design process. In November 2022, officials from my Department met Cork ETB and its design team and a number of recommendations were made in relation to the design of the project. Cork ETB's design team incorporated these recommendations in its stage 2A addendum report, which was submitted to the Department of Education in August. This was reviewed by the Department's professional and technical team and approval to progress to stage 2B is now sanctioned. The next step for Cork ETB and its design team will be to obtain the requisite statutory planning approvals and incorporating same into the detailed design and tender documentation for the new school project. The Department will continue to work closely with Cork ETB to ensure support and to monitor progress on this project. Cork ETB will also engage with the school community to keep it updated on all significant developments. This project is part of the strong pipeline of projects being delivered under the Department's school building programme involving almost 300 projects at construction in 2023, which include more than 40 new school buildings. This is a very positive step forward for this school. I know it is a school that is very close to the Deputy's heart. It is a school that is richly deserving of advancement. It is a very positive news story that we can say that stage 2B has now been sanctioned and that the next step is to move towards the requisite statutory planning approvals.	spk_192

Tá dea-scéal againn ó thaobh Choláiste Ghobnatan inniu. Tá céimeanna eile ann anois. There are a number of next steps. The first and perhaps most important step has now been taken in that it has progressed to stage 2B, and that has been sanctioned. The next step will be for Cork ETB and its design team to obtain the requisite statutory planning approvals and to incorporate them into the detailed design and tender documentation for the new school project.The Department will be very happy to work and liaise with Cork ETB to support and monitor progress of the project. Cork ETB in turn will also engage with the school community to keep it updated on all significant developments. That is hugely important because there is extraordinary buy-in, in both the immediate school community and the wider community, when they see developments for schools going forward. This is a very positive, good news story for Coláiste Ghobnatan, and I look forward to it moving ahead from all these demands as quickly as possible.	spk_194
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	An application for provision of additional capacity at the school in question was given initial approval in 2019 for delivery on a devolved basis under the Department's additional school accommodation, ASA scheme. This approval included provision for mainstream, specialist rooms and two special educational needs classes. The main focus of the Department’s additional accommodation scheme is on provision of additional capacity to meet the requirement for school places, including for students with special educational needs. The accommodation needs of the school in question were assessed in that context and a requirement for additional classroom accommodation was identified. Having appraised the accommodation needs of the school based on the information that was available at the time, the project brief was agreed by the school authorities, with an agreed long-term expected enrolment of 650 pupils. Official approval issued to the school to proceed with this project and it is currently at stage 1 of the architectural planning process. However, the school has since submitted a further application for the ASA scheme and requested a full review of its entire accommodation. The needs of the school and the wider school planning area are currently being reviewed by my officials, to consider the scope of necessary provision in the school under reference. A key overarching priority is to ensure that existing school capacity is fully utilised across a local area before any additional capacity is considered. Officials have been in touch with the school authorities directly to seek information relating to a number of issues, in order to allow for a full review of the application as requested by the school. When this information is received, the assessment process will be concluded and a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities directly. In the interim, it is also open to the school in question to apply for the Department's emergency works scheme, which will consider applications for funding to address any immediate health and safety issues arising. The main focus of the Department’s resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on the provision of critical additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics. The Department is required to manage the overall school building programme in order that we target and prioritise areas that are under greatest pressure for additional school places. The overall position with regard to potential modernisation and replacement of existing infrastructure will be kept under review as capital funding allocations for future years are clarified.	spk_196
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	I would be delighted to, when I am in the Deputy's area. I will say that initial approval was granted but the school itself came back with a request for a full review of its application. The Department is working with the school in that regard. As I have said, the Department engaged directly with the school to seek information on a number of issues in order for it to make the fullest review of the application. When the Department is in full receipt of this information, the assessment process will be completed as quickly as we possibly can. I am very pleased to say that there is engagement between the school and the Department.	spk_198
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_16	I thank the Deputy and we look forward to receiving the information from the school and continuing to engage with it prior to the full review of the application.	spk_200
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_17	I confirm to the Deputy that an application for major capital funding has been received from the school in question. There are significant demand pressures on the school system at present arising from demographic growth, the need to align school place provision with housing developments, increased demand for special educational needs provision and the accommodation of children from Ukraine. Under Project Ireland 2040, in excess of €5 billion will be invested in school infrastructure during the period 2021 to 2025. The Deputy will appreciate the Department's priority in recent years has been providing additional capacity to ensure that every child has a school place, including children with special educational needs, and this continues to be the case.  The application from the school in question was assessed under the additional school accommodation, ASA, scheme. The purpose of the ASA scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom and special educational needs, SEN, accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school's existing accommodation. At primary level, this situation generally arises to cater for a school's accommodation requirements where an additional teaching post has been sanctioned by my Department, or a new special class has been sanctioned by the National Council for Special Education, and all available alternative accommodation within the school is already being used for classroom purposes. The Department has indicated to the school authority in question that it is willing to provide modular accommodation for a special education teaching room at the school. The Department awaits a reply from the school authorities in relation to this. It is also open to the school in question to apply for my Department's emergency works scheme, which will consider applications for funding to address any immediate health and safety issues. The main focus of my Department's capital allocation over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of critical additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics. The Department is required to manage the overall school building programme so that we target and prioritise areas that are under greatest pressure for additional school places. This reflects our fundamental objective of ensuring the availability of a school place for every child. The Department has a strong track record of project delivery. From 2018 to 2022, nearly 900 school building projects were completed under a variety of delivery mechanisms. Some 300 projects are under construction during 2023, of which 40 are new school buildings. The overall position with regard to potential modernisation and upgrade of existing infrastructure will be kept under review as capital funding allocations are clarified.	spk_157
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_17	I appreciate the Deputy’s advocacy for the school. The Department has made an offer to the school in respect of a special education teaching room. We await the school’s engagement on that. For any issues that might be regarded as an emergency and for some of the issues the Deputy mentioned, there is a very clear pathway to make emergency funding made readily available to schools if there is a need. I do not want there to be any doubt about that. As I said, we keep everything under review in the context of the capital envelope we have. More than 300 buildings are at various stages of construction, of which 40 are new school buildings. In the coming months, the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform will engage with other Departments, including my Department, on NDP allocations for the 2026-28 period, with allocation decisions expected during the first half of 2024. In the interim, my Department will continue to engage with the authorities of the school in question with respect to accommodation needs.	spk_159
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_17	The Deputy has highlighted a short-term and a long-term vision for the school. I restate that if there is any issue with safety that is causing difficulty in the school, the way forward is through the emergency works scheme, which will be made available to the school to meet its needs. Provision is being made for special education teaching, which is positive. We have an ambitious building programme, with over 300 school buildings at different stages of development. The programme is kept under constant review. I spoke of our engagement with Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform on the NDP and its allocations. We should have some word on that in early to mid-2024. In the interim, I am very happy for my Department to continue to engage with the school in question.	spk_161
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Curriculum	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy for the question. I know it is an area on which he has advocated very strongly. I am very pleased that the counselling pilot has been well received. The Department of Education is committed to supporting the emotional well-being of our children and I am pleased to provide an update on the significant progress that has been made on strands 1 and 2 of the pilot in almost 650 primary schools across the country. I am also pleased to announce that the Department has secured additional funding in budget 2024 to continue the pilot for an additional year, until June 2025. The pilot includes two strands. Strand 1 will see the provision of one-to-one counselling to support a small number of children in all primary schools in counties Cavan, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Monaghan and Tipperary. Considerable work has been undertaken to identify suitably qualified, experienced and accredited counsellors. In the absence of a single recognised counselling qualification and a national regulatory body for counselling in Ireland at this time, the Department initially liaised with the three largest accrediting bodies for counsellors in Ireland, namely, the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, IACP, the Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI, and the Irish Association of Humanistic and Integrative Psychotherapists in Ireland, IAHIP. The Department has subsequently liaised with additional associations and is now also accepting applications from counsellors accredited with the Irish Association of Psychotherapy and Play Therapy, IAPPT, the Association of Child Art Psychotherapists, ACAP, and those registered with the Irish Council for Psychotherapy, ICP. Due to the highly sensitive nature of providing counselling for children, the application and vetting process for these counsellors requires significant time and attention in order to ensure the highest quality in this landmark pilot project. However, I am very pleased to advise that we will be in touch with schools in the coming weeks in relation to the initial allocation of counselling hours to schools. Schools, in consultation with a NEPS psychologist, and guided by the Department of Education’s continuum of support, will identify the children who may benefit most from this counselling service, which will be subject to parental or legal guardian informed consent. Strand 2 will see the establishment of a new type of support to schools from education well-being teams and the introduction of well-being practitioners to support clusters of schools in Cork, Carlow, Dublin 7 and Dublin 16.	spk_163
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Curriculum	dbsect_18	We are all aware that this initiative will be of enormous benefit and support to our primary schools and their staff who do tremendous work every day. We know there is a growing need in the area of well-being. I am pleased that we have secured additional funding in budget 2024 to ensure the scheme can run longer than was envisaged originally. Two different schemes will run. Counsellors will be available to schools, as I already outlined, and, in the second strand, education well-being teams and practitioners will be introduced. When we have an opportunity to analyse both schemes , we will learn a great deal about what we need to do in future and what the best approach will be, whether it is one or other strand or a combination of both. It is a significant departure and a landmark for the Department to do this and it is right that we do it.	spk_165
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Curriculum	dbsect_18	Regarding NEPS, I want to be 100% clear. There is no cut - absolutely none - in the NEPS funding made available this year. What has happened, which was clarified, is that the heading under which payments such as salaries, etc., for NEPS are made has been moved to a different subhead. There has been no cut whatsoever in NEPS funding. I welcome the very positive endorsement many Members have given to the roll-out of this programme. There has also been a very positive endorsement from schools. Reference was made to play therapists. The Department has liaised with additional associations and is now accepting applications from counsellors accredited by the IAPTP and the ACAP and those registered with the ICP. Any involvement of a young person in this scheme will have to be signed off by a parent or legal guardian, as would always be the case. On the different strands, strand 1 is counsellor-led and strand 2 involves well-being practitioners. Well-being practitioners in strand 2 have been interviewed and positions offered. We anticipate that these graduates in psychology, for example, or social care, will be employed in the four pilot areas in the coming weeks. They will initially receive additional training from NEPS psychologists.	spk_171
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_19	I am pleased the Deputy has brought this matter to my attention because there seems to be some confusion. In order to respond to the issue raised, it is important to clarify the distinction between a sensory room, which serves a whole school, and a calming space within a classroom, which may be used by students within a specific classroom. I say this only for the record because I know the Deputy is well aware of it. A sensory room in a school can enhance and promote the health and well-being of the whole school, with a focus on both the culture and environment. It is a designated area within a school which can support a student’s sensory preferences and needs and provide students with the individualised sensory input they need to self-regulate, so they can be better prepared for learning and interacting with others. Funding of €7,000 is made available by the Department's loose furniture and equipment section for the provision of the start-up of a sensory room within a school. In order to be eligible for the grant, the school must demonstrate that it has a National Council for Special Education, NCSE, approved autism spectrum disorder, ASD, class and that there is a suitable room to house the sensory room. The sensory room must be a separate room from that of the ASD class and must have its own separate entry and exit. Only one sensory room grant is funded by the Department per school. In addition to a sensory room, a school may have a calming space, the design of which is very different from a sensory room. The calming space should be located within or directly off the classroom base and is intended as a safe, quiet area that a pupil, under the supervision of a staff member, can access for a short period of time if they need some quiet time to themselves The design of the space must allow staff to observe pupils unobtrusively from the classroom. The calming space is designed to ensure that a student may choose to access it to take a break or to help with regulation. Calming activities are made available to the student depending on their individual needs and preferences and may include items such as stress balls, books, soft toys and-or noise-cancelling headphones. The calming space is to be designed as a quiet zone or alcove within the classroom without enclosing walls and not as a separate room. These spaces may involve an area of the classroom set up with cushions or a tent to limit sensory stimuli or a space with calming activities and materials which is visible to either a teacher or a special needs assistant.	spk_173
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_19	I want to be very clear that there is a distinction between the two. The sensory room is a room open to the entire school. The quiet space is contained within a given classroom at a given time. It is supervised by the existing teacher and-or an SNA. With regard to the specific case raised by the Deputy, I emphasise that the Department has not refused a grant to equip a sensory room. The school applied for funding in relation to a calming space - not a sensory room - within a classroom, which does not qualify for the sensory room start-up grant funding. It applied for funding for a calming space, not for a sensory room. A special educational needs classroom has also been approved for the school under the Department’s modular programme, which is currently in train. The Department provides start-up funding of €6,500 for each SEN classroom. This funding can be used by the school in question to purchase furniture and equipment for a calming space if it so wishes. In addition to this funding, the option remains open to the school to apply for a sensory room start-up grant if the school has not previously received such a grant and has a suitable space available. The application will need to include the drawings or whatever else is required. It is open to the school to make such an application.	spk_175
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_19	I will be very clear; my Department has engaged with the school and has communicated the information I imparted to the Deputy to the principal of the school in question. We would be more than pleased to engage with the principal on an ongoing basis to satisfy the needs presented. However, let me be very clear that there is no ambiguity. I visit schools all of the time and this has never been raised with me before. Schools are very clear on the distinction between calming spaces, which are located within classroom settings, and sensory rooms. Sensory rooms are open to the entire school and therefore must be independent and distinct. Calming spaces are within the students' classroom. I am at a loss to understand where the difficulty arose here. Be that as it may, difficulties and misunderstandings can arise. The Department has proactively reached out to the school. We are very happy to work with it in whatever respect is required.	spk_177

Tá céimeanna glactha ag mo Roinn chun an gealltanas atá i gclár an Rialtais maidir le polasaí agus straitéis don Ghaeilge sa chóras oideachais a chomhlíonadh le dúthracht. Tá an obair seo á cur chun cinn i gcomhthéacs chuspóirí na straitéise 20-bliain don Ghaeilge. Ó foilsíodh é, tá an polasaí don oideachas Gaeltachta tar éis oideachas trí mheán na Gaeilge a neartú i gceantair Ghaeltachta. Faoin bpolasaí sin, tá tacaíocht láidir tugtha ag mo Roinn do scoileanna Gaeltachta tríd an scéim aitheantais. Tá critéir theanga leagtha amach do na scoileanna chun a chinntiú go bhfuil oideachas den scoth á chur ar fáil acu trí mheán na Gaeilge. Chun tacú leis an obair seo: cuirtear deontas ar fáil dóibh chun ábhair a cheannach; faigheann siad uaireanta tacaíochta teanga don Ghaeilge bunaithe ar rollú na scoile; baineann siad leas as cuairteanna comhairleacha ón gcigireacht; agus tugann an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta, COGG, tacaíocht ghairmiúil dóibh chomh maith. Tríd an tionscadal e-hub do scoileanna Gaeltachta, tá scoláirí anois ag déanamh staidéir ar an fhisic agus ar an cheimic don ardteistiméireacht trí fhoghlaim ar líne. Ní raibh sé seo ar fáil dóibh roimhe seo. Chomh maith, tá infheistíocht déanta againn faoin bpolasaí chun soláthar na múinteoirí atá in ann oibriú go héifeachtach trí Ghaeilge a mhéadú. Is féidir tionchar dearfach an pholasaí a mhothú i scoileanna agus i bpobail ar fud na Gaeltachta. Tá obair faoi lán seoil i mo Roinn chun polasaí nua a fhorbairt don oideachas lán-Ghaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht freisin. Tógann an polasaí nua seo ar a bhfuil bainte amach ag an bpolasaí don oideachas Gaeltachta. Is céim thábhachtach eile i dtreo cuspóirí chlár an Rialtais a bhaint amach é seo. Bunaíodh coiste stiúrtha le hionadaithe ó na Ranna agus ó na gníomhaireachtaí Rialtais chun maoirseacht a dhéanamh ar fhorbairt an pholasaí.  A public consultation process has been conducted to gather the views of stakeholders, including young people, parents, educational professionals, education stakeholders and Irish language organisations. There were three phases in the consultation comprising an online questionnaire, a call for written submissions and a series of focus groups and bilateral meetings between the Department and stakeholders.	spk_179
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Oideachas trí Ghaeilge	dbsect_20	To give some detail on what is happening in the process, which is quite involved, SEALBHÚ, the research centre in Dublin City University, DCU, is currently carrying out an analysis of all of the information that has been gathered throughout the process. The reports will be shared with the steering committee and with the interdepartmental working group in due course. A number of actions are being taken to ensure that the new policy will be informed by current research. A review of national and international literature has been commissioned through a public procurement process and is being carried out by SEALBHÚ at DCU. A report giving an overview of provision for Irish-medium education outside of Gaeltacht areas was compiled and published by the Department. Research on Irish-medium aonaid and sruthanna in English-medium schools is being carried out. Two composite reports on inspection findings on the quality of education provision in Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí were published in spring 2021. These reports provide a helpful insight into practice in schools. A report on inspection findings from visits to Irish-medium early learning and care settings is also being prepared. I am really pleased with the level of interest that has been demonstrated in the consultation to date and with the number of responses received. I look forward to progressing the important work of strengthening Irish-medium education provision and building on the positive outcomes already being achieved in the implementation of the policy on Gaeltacht education.	spk_181

As the Deputy will be aware, the validation process commenced in October 2022. Recognition as a Gaeltacht school will be awarded to a school when it is confirmed that the school's practice has been developed in accordance with the language-based criteria. As the Deputy has outlined, the process involves a visit from the inspectorate to schools participating in the scheme to assess their progress in implementing the criteria. The visit includes input from school staff, students and parents' representatives. Following the visit, the inspector writes a report on the detailed findings of the evaluation. The school is then given an opportunity to verify the facts in the report and to respond to it. It is therefore quite an involved process but it is important that, on foot of the inspectorate's visit, the school is given an opportunity to reply. It is expected that the inspectors' evaluations will be entirely completed by Easter 2024. Over half of the schools in the scheme have received an evaluation visit to date. Official recognition has not been awarded to any school yet as the process is ongoing. Schools will be contacted in due course as regards the outcome of the validation process. It is likely that the first batch of results under the validation process will be received by schools prior to Christmas.	spk_183
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_21	The school transport scheme is a significant operation and, as the Deputy will be aware, it is managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the 2022-23 school year, over 149,000 young people, including over 18,000 children with special educational needs, were transported to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country every day. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year for over 5,400 children who have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €338.9 million. There has been an overall increase in the numbers of both applications and tickets issued for the 2023-24 school year in comparison to the 2022-23 school year.Under the current terms of the scheme, pupils at primary level are eligible where they live not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post-primary level, students who live not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school are deemed eligible. Any pupils or students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for. Temporary alleviation measures, TAMs, at post-primary level are being continued for the current school year. Undoubtedly, the school transport scheme is of enormous importance in terms of encouraging the use of public transport and taking cars off the road. It also brings significant benefit in the area of congestion and traffic management in towns and villages. Considering how to best maximise these benefits now and into the future has been a significant factor in the ongoing review of the scheme. The review has been conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. This review has built upon the commitments within the programme for Government, as they relate to school transport, including examining options to reduce car journeys and assessing how the school transport scheme can work in liaison with the safe routes to schools programme. The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications was on the membership of the steering group for the review and its input and views on how the school transport scheme can support climate action targets have been included in the final report. It is also important to note that officials from my Department also engage regularly with their counterparts in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the development of the climate action plan, CAP, both the current CAP 23 and the forthcoming CAP 24.	spk_186
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_21	I know Deputy O'Rourke has an enormous interest in this area, both from the climate action point of view and from recognising the importance of the benefit of the school transport scheme. He is quite correct that there was an interim review and a final review. Phase 1 of the review was completed in June 2021 and examined the impact of eligibility criteria for the scheme on mainstream pupils who were eligible for transport to their nearest school but attending their next nearest school. The steering group presented me with that report and, following consideration of the report, the Deputy will be aware that we introduced the TAMs for students who are attending not just their nearest post-primary school but their next nearest. These measures have been continued for 2022 to 2023. There has been a significant body of work in terms of engagement with parents, students, providers, those who do not use the scheme, and looking at best practice with our European counterparts. It is my expectation that it will be published shortly, but prior to that it has to go to the Government, and then it will be published. That is quite imminent.	spk_188
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_21	A key aspect of the review is that we would be very much within our climate action targets. The climate action plan includes a specific target to increase the number of journeys being taken using sustainable travel, whether it is cycling, walking or sustainable public transport by an additional 125,000 journeys by 2025 and a 30% shift in escort-to-education car journeys to more sustainable modes of transport by 2030. By that I mean people driving children to school or whatever. The plan also requires Ireland to achieve a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions not later than 2050. Encouraging greater uptake of school transport scheme services can support the achievement of these targets. That involves looking at everything in the most holistic way, whether it is the fleet itself or encouraging more people to engage in it and meeting our climate action targets.	spk_190
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_22	Through Project Ireland 2040, over the period 2021-25, in excess of €5 billion will be invested in upgrading school facilities across the country for the almost 1 million students and more than 100,000 staff members who learn and work in our schools every day. The Department has approved a large-scale building project for the school to which the Deputy refers. He has advocated very strongly on an ongoing basis for this school. The project involves the provision of a new-build extension and alterations to the existing school buildings that will provide modern school facilities and cater for an enrolment of 300 students. The project has been devolved for delivery to Cork Education and Training Board, ETB, and has recently been approved to move to stage 2B of the architectural design process. In November 2022, officials from my Department met Cork ETB and its design team and a number of recommendations were made in relation to the design of the project. Cork ETB's design team incorporated these recommendations in its stage 2A addendum report, which was submitted to the Department of Education in August. This was reviewed by the Department's professional and technical team and approval to progress to stage 2B is now sanctioned. The next step for Cork ETB and its design team will be to obtain the requisite statutory planning approvals and incorporating same into the detailed design and tender documentation for the new school project. The Department will continue to work closely with Cork ETB to ensure support and to monitor progress on this project. Cork ETB will also engage with the school community to keep it updated on all significant developments. This project is part of the strong pipeline of projects being delivered under the Department's school building programme involving almost 300 projects at construction in 2023, which include more than 40 new school buildings. This is a very positive step forward for this school. I know it is a school that is very close to the Deputy's heart. It is a school that is richly deserving of advancement. It is a very positive news story that we can say that stage 2B has now been sanctioned and that the next step is to move towards the requisite statutory planning approvals.	spk_192

Tá dea-scéal againn ó thaobh Choláiste Ghobnatan inniu. Tá céimeanna eile ann anois. There are a number of next steps. The first and perhaps most important step has now been taken in that it has progressed to stage 2B, and that has been sanctioned. The next step will be for Cork ETB and its design team to obtain the requisite statutory planning approvals and to incorporate them into the detailed design and tender documentation for the new school project.The Department will be very happy to work and liaise with Cork ETB to support and monitor progress of the project. Cork ETB in turn will also engage with the school community to keep it updated on all significant developments. That is hugely important because there is extraordinary buy-in, in both the immediate school community and the wider community, when they see developments for schools going forward. This is a very positive, good news story for Coláiste Ghobnatan, and I look forward to it moving ahead from all these demands as quickly as possible.	spk_194
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-17	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	An application for provision of additional capacity at the school in question was given initial approval in 2019 for delivery on a devolved basis under the Department's additional school accommodation, ASA scheme. This approval included provision for mainstream, specialist rooms and two special educational needs classes. The main focus of the Department’s additional accommodation scheme is on provision of additional capacity to meet the requirement for school places, including for students with special educational needs. The accommodation needs of the school in question were assessed in that context and a requirement for additional classroom accommodation was identified. Having appraised the accommodation needs of the school based on the information that was available at the time, the project brief was agreed by the school authorities, with an agreed long-term expected enrolment of 650 pupils. Official approval issued to the school to proceed with this project and it is currently at stage 1 of the architectural planning process. However, the school has since submitted a further application for the ASA scheme and requested a full review of its entire accommodation. The needs of the school and the wider school planning area are currently being reviewed by my officials, to consider the scope of necessary provision in the school under reference. A key overarching priority is to ensure that existing school capacity is fully utilised across a local area before any additional capacity is considered. Officials have been in touch with the school authorities directly to seek information relating to a number of issues, in order to allow for a full review of the application as requested by the school. When this information is received, the assessment process will be concluded and a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities directly. In the interim, it is also open to the school in question to apply for the Department's emergency works scheme, which will consider applications for funding to address any immediate health and safety issues arising. The main focus of the Department’s resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on the provision of critical additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics. The Department is required to manage the overall school building programme in order that we target and prioritise areas that are under greatest pressure for additional school places. The overall position with regard to potential modernisation and replacement of existing infrastructure will be kept under review as capital funding allocations for future years are clarified.	spk_196

I will say that initial approval was granted but the school itself came back with a request for a full review of its application. The Department is working with the school in that regard. As I have said, the Department engaged directly with the school to seek information on a number of issues in order for it to make the fullest review of the application. When the Department is in full receipt of this information, the assessment process will be completed as quickly as we possibly can.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-11	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 4: General (Resumed)	dbsect_18	I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House this evening on budget 2024, and in particular to highlight some of its key features for children, young people and their families. This is a hugely progressive budget, which has its heart supporting individuals, families, communities and all sectors of society. In the short time I have, I will speak in particular to the budget benefits for children, young people and their families. Investment in our youngest generation begins with more than €1 billion investment in early years and childcare. This Government has halved the cost of childcare in the past two budgets, ensuring that families receiving even the minimum level of subsidy under the national childcare scheme will receive up to €5,000. Once a child enrols in primary school, they will benefit from the care and expertise of our excellent staff, now employed in their highest numbers ever. A capital budget of almost €1 billion is intended to ensure that every child has access to an appropriate school place, and that schools can benefit from building upgrades and modernisation. As of this school year, all children enrolling in primary school receive all books and classroom resources free of charge. This has reduced costs for families significantly, and ensures every child can enter the classroom on a level footing. I am pleased to have secured additional funding under budget 2024 to roll this scheme out for all junior cycle students. Funding of €67 million will be made available to underpin this measure, which will deliver an average saving for families of almost €1,000 over the course of their junior cycle career. Combined with 568,000 students benefiting at primary level, this will bring to almost 800,000 the number of students in receipt of free books and classroom resources. The Department of Education's €10.5 billion budget also provides for an additional 1,200 special needs assistants, SNAs, and 744 special education teachers, ensuring that children who need additional care and support can access this, whether in a special school, class or mainstream setting. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will give further details of the initiatives within special education. An additional €5 million is also provided under budget 2024 to continue our provision of mental health supports within primary schools, charting new territory and ensuring students are adequately supported to meet their fullest potential. Exam fees are also waived for junior cycle and senior cycle pupils. Funding has also been secured to help to defray school transport costs for families. Of course, I am more than conscious that our ambitious agenda and the dreams we have for Irish children and young people cannot be fulfilled without the hard work, dedication and sheer talent of our staff. That is why I have secured more than €81 million in additional grant funding for schools, which will be paid on a  In recognition of the challenges facing us in teacher supply, I have secured additional funding for new upskilling programmes and to provide a €2,000 grant to professional masters in education students on completion of their training. Access to free hot school meals has also been extended thanks to further investment under budget 2024, which sees the scheme expanded to include 900 additional primary schools. Families will receive a double child benefit payment of €280 before Christmas, and 18-year-olds will now be eligible to receive this payment if they are still in full-time education. Significant funding has also been provided to broaden access to further and higher education, and to reduce fees for families. These are just some of the measures which give a sense of the Government's investment and commitment to children, young people and their families.	spk_164
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-10-03	dail	33	School Transport 2023-2024: Statements	dbsect_14	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to make a statement to update the House on school transport provision for the current school year. Coming from a rural background, I know, understand, and appreciate the importance of school transport to parents and families around the country. I know there are lot of moms, dads, and guardians relying on the scheme to bring their children to and from school. To give a sense of the scale of the scheme, in the 2022-23 school year, more than 154,000 young people, including more than 18,000 children with special educational needs, SEN, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €338.9 million. This includes direct transport services, and grant payments. It also includes funding to schools for the employment of escorts to accompany children with special educational needs whose care and safety needs require this particular type of support. The scheme is managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. For the 2023-24 school year, reduced charges of €50 per pupil at primary level and €75 per student at post-primary level apply, with a cap per family of €125. This means that ticket holders will save up to €50 at primary and €275 at post-primary, with an overall reduction in the family maximum contribution of €525 compared to the fees for the 2021-22 school year. There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023-24 school year in comparison to the 2022-23 school year. With regard to SEN transport services, to date, more than 5,000 new applications have been received for SEN transport for the 2023-24 school year, with 1,400 of these being received since July alone. This compares to 3,670 new applications received at this time last year. To date, transport has been provided for more than 3,000 new applicants for the 2023-24 school year, with transport being provided for in excess of 19,000 pupils in the current school year. The Department continues to receive applications all year round for the SEN transport service. As with most, if not all, Government schemes, there are criteria governing the operation of the scheme. Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post-primary level, students who live not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school or education centre are deemed eligible. Any pupils or students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for. In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the school transport scheme, temporary alleviation measures at post-primary level will be continued for the current school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will be provided where it is in operation and where capacity exists for concessionary post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied and paid on time. I now want to address specific issues that have arisen this year where a small number of contractors handed back contracts at the last minute or continue to do so. Consequently, there are a small number of families who have been issued with tickets in good faith and who do not yet have transport in place. These families are being regularly updated by Bus Éireann as to the current status of their service. Bus Éireann has confirmed that no service has been cancelled but, as I said, there are particular issues with resource availability in terms of drivers or contractors, a number of contractors continuing to hand back contracts or zero bids for contracts in certain areas. This is against a backdrop of significant shortages of drivers in the labour market overall and competing demands for drivers to deliver additional public transport initiatives such as Connecting Ireland, and Bus Connects and Local Link services. Bus Éireann is continuing to prioritise sourcing vehicles and drivers. While I understand the significant difficulty that even a single disruption to service can cause for families, I note that Bus Éireann has confirmed that services are in operation for 99% of pupils on a daily basis. I reiterate that where the service is not operating for a single parent or guardian and children, I understand the difficulties that can cause. Bus Éireann continues to engage directly with families affected with regular communications updating them on the position with their transport service. The Department has established an exceptional no service interim grant to assist with the cost of the private transport arrangements families may have to put in place until their service begins. The Department has contacted families directly regarding this payment.  In regard to transport for children with special educational needs, the Department and Bus Éireann are very conscious of the challenges faced by parents awaiting transport for students with special educational needs. Families of children who are eligible for these services but who experience a delay with accessing them may, therefore, apply for the special transport grant. This is a once off payment, paid retrospectively to families, to assist with the cost of the private transport arrangements the family had to put in place until services are finalised.  Where a new service is sanctioned, this means a procurement or vetting process is required while, in many instances, the school is also sanctioned to employ a transport escort and this necessarily takes time to put in place. It is necessary that these measures are put in place. By accepting applications year-round, the Department can ensure that children with special educational needs receive the transport they require. To ensure the efficient delivery of services for children on special educations needs school transport, Bus Éireann assesses each application to assess the options available. Where children can be facilitated on an existing service, applications are processed immediately and arrangements put in place with families involved.  The Department is engaging with the NTA on areas where transport is not yet in place. The authority has also indicated there are challenges sourcing contractors and drivers for Local Link services, for example. Bus Éireann has put in place a dedicated customer care call centre to assist families specifically with school transport queries during the busy summer period. Families that have queries can contact the call centre between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday to Thursday, with extended opening hours currently on Friday when the helpline stays open until 8 p.m. Families can also contact Bus Éireann by submitting a query via a link on its website. These queries are monitored and responded to on a daily basis.  As Members will all be aware, a review of the school transport scheme is nearing completion. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. This review is much-awaited, and I know that many are eager to hear its outcome. I too am eager to advance the review, because I recognise that improvements need to be made to the scheme and I know the importance of doing so. I expect to be in a position shortly to bring the review to Government, which will be the first step and, further to Government approval, the review will be published.  The school transport scheme has been in operation for more than 55 years, since its establishment in 1967, and this review is one of the most extensive investigations that has been carried out into the scheme since its inception. Fundamentally, I want to ensure that the school transport scheme is updated to reflect the modern realities facing it and that it can continue to benefit children and families for decades to come. Among other elements, the review has analysed the evolution of the objectives of the scheme; the rationale for the scheme with reference to the public spending code; how the scheme fits with school planning policy; how the scheme fits with broader Government policy and programme for Government commitments; the value for money of the scheme to the Exchequer and parents and guardians; transport schemes in other jurisdictions and the learnings that can be gleaned from best practice and experiences from those jurisdictions; the stakeholder engagement process, where the opinions, views and experiences of those who are experts in the field are shared; and the fiscal sustainability of the scheme.  As part of the review, between February 2021 and June 2023, a total of 16 meetings were held with the technical working group and eight meetings were held with the steering group. Towards the end of phases 2 and 3 of the review, a series of meetings were also held with individual members of the technical working group and the steering group.  There has been extensive consultation with parents, students, providers and other key stakeholders as part of this engagement and we consulted with families who use the scheme and would like to use the scheme, and also with young people with special educational needs and mainstream students. It is very important that we have engaged with those who are not currently using the scheme but would like to use it. As I outlined, we heard from a broad range of people, including parents, guardians, young people, transport providers and other key stakeholders. The results from the stakeholder engagement with parents and children illustrated the importance of school transport to families, with most indicating it is a safe and reliable service that helps families to live and work, in particular in rural Ireland. Another important finding of the stakeholder engagement process was that the special educational needs transport scheme supports many young people in attending specialist school placements which they otherwise may not be able to attend.  An analysis of school transport schemes in other jurisdictions was also conducted as part of this stakeholder engagement and review process, including the EU, UK, US and Australia. A wide breadth of expertise was leaned upon and gleaned during the review. This research and analysis outlined the evidence in terms of the need for a school transport service in an Irish context compared to some comparative countries, as well as an analysis of the costs to users of school transport services in some other jurisdictions.  The Department developed a strategy for collaboration and communication with stakeholders. Overall, there were five separate stakeholder groups. Letters were issued to a number of stakeholders, including school management bodies, parent representative organisations, special education interest groups, EU member states and school principals, to seek their views on the school transport scheme. Parents, guardians and post primary students were invited to complete online surveys, more than 10,000 of which were done. A series of bilateral engagements were completed with relevant Departments, agencies, bodies and organisations to discuss the review and seek views. Meetings have been held with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, Transport, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Rural and Community Development and Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, NTA, Ombudsman for Children, National Council for Special Education, school transport appeals board, National Council for Special Education, TUSLA, Bus Éireann and the Road Safety Authority.  As I said, more than 10,000 online surveys were completed by parents and students, which was phenomenal engagement, and more than 245 additional submissions were received from other stakeholders such as relevant Departments, interest groups and school principals. In analysing the information gathered in the survey and the submissions, it is clear that school transport is vital for families.  In undertaking this review, a number of member states were invited to complete a survey to assist with the analysis of transport schemes in other jurisdictions. A total of 12 complete or partially complete surveys were returned. In addition, a meeting was held with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland to discuss how the school transport scheme operates in that jurisdiction.  Ultimately, the review will make a series of recommendations on the future operations of the scheme. Additional staffing personnel have been put in place to facilitate this. The timeframe for completion of the review was first challenged by the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, which demanded significant additional work to ensure that transport services could operate fully and safely throughout the pandemic. Furthermore, as Deputies will be aware, the arrival of significant numbers of children from Ukraine has required additional resources to ensure that transport services are up and running for them to access, often under tight timeframes and with changing circumstances.  It is clear that a significant body of work has been undertaken by the Department, in terms of a wide-ranging, comprehensive and inclusive review. I once again thank the House for the invitation to join Members today and provide an update on the work under way to operationalise the existing scheme and review its operation. We review it with the intention of ensuring that it is fit for purpose now and in the future and will meet the needs of students and families for many years to come. An enormous and worthy body of work has been undertaken. I thank Members for their engagement on the review and all of those who participated so positively and proactively with the review. I again thank them for the invitation to be here today. 	spk_102
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	Pupil-Teacher Ratio	dbsect_15	As the Deputy has articulated, the SEC has specific responsibility for the operation, delivery and development of the State examinations. As part of its remit, the SEC provides the scheme of reasonable accommodations, which is known as the RACE scheme. This scheme facilitates access to the State exams by candidates who would have difficulty in accessing the exams or communicating what they know because of a physical difficulty, visual or hearing impairments or a learning difficulty. A physical difficulty could include medical, sensory, behavioural or mental health difficulties. The SEC advises that the focus of the RACE scheme is on the need to remove barriers to accessing the examinations while retaining the need to assess the same underlying skills and competencies as are assessed for all other candidates and applying the same standards of achievement as apply to all other candidates. A central tenet of the RACE scheme is to ensure equitable treatment for all candidates. The range of accommodations provided under the scheme has been designed to ensure fairness for all when facilitating candidates in demonstrating their level of achievement. The RACE scheme is operated by the SEC within the context of the annually issued RACE Instructions for Schools, which is the handbook on RACE. All applications for reasonable accommodations are considered within a published framework of principles. The SEC has advised that, in 2022, almost 25,000 candidates, or 19% of the total candidates, were provided with 30,000 individual accommodations under the RACE scheme. This is an increase over 2019, when 20,000 candidates, or 17% of the total, were provided with accommodation. From the 2016 to 2017 school year, the RACE scheme underwent fundamental reform. The reform focused on a number of areas and intended to ensure greater integration of the RACE scheme with overall Department of Education special educational needs policy, to enable greater access to the scheme, and to allow greater autonomy to schools and certainty to students about the examination supports available to them. These candidate-centred changes were informed by engagement with stakeholders. This included representatives of students, including those with special educational needs, such as the Dyslexia Association of Ireland, the Special Needs Parents Association, school management and leadership bodies, Government agencies, including the National Council for Special Education and the National Disability Authority, and statutory bodies. The RACE scheme continues to be subject to a process of ongoing review and improvement by the SEC. For example, recent enhancements to the scheme include the introduction of deferred examinations, within the policy context of the scheme, for leaving certificate candidates who miss their examinations in the main sitting due to close family bereavement, serious accident, illness or injury. A number of specific initiatives were introduced in 2023 for candidates with visual impairments. In addition to the fundamental reform for the 2016 to 2017 school year, and the ongoing process of review and improvement, the scheme will be subject to further review by the SEC in the context of reform of the senior cycle. One of the key priorities will be increasing the use of assistive technology to enhance access and integrity and to further support independent learning. In this regard, I am assured the SEC intends that there will be extensive consultation and engagement with all relevant stakeholders.	spk_83
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	Pupil-Teacher Ratio	dbsect_15	I thank the Deputy. She is correct. I agree there is enormous importance attached to the RACE scheme. I understand the most recent full review was carried out in 2016-2017. In the interim, there have also been amendments, particularly for candidates who present as visually impaired. Also, schools have devolved authority to recommend to the SEC the supports available within the RACE scheme that should be put in place in the junior cycle and at leaving certificate level. The SEC, in general, accepts the recommendation of the school. Accommodations granted at junior cycle can also be reactivated at leaving certificate level. If RACE accommodation has not been granted, there is an opportunity for an independent appeal to that decision. The Deputy referred to those presenting with a visual impairment. A number of amendments have been made to provide, for example, for enlarged versions of the standard and modified examination papers. There is a Braille version of the standard and modified examination papers. Reading accommodations include the provision of an individual reader, reading assistant or exam reading pen. Writing accommodations include a word processor or recording device to record the candidate's responses and access to a scribe. The Deputy also specifically referred to dyslexia. The SEC has in place a spelling and grammar waiver. I also know there is an ongoing request for further review in that regard. It is my understanding the SEC has met representatives of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland. Everything is kept under constant review.	spk_85
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	Pupil-Teacher Ratio	dbsect_15	I believe in this scheme. I believe fundamentally that we must do all we can to ensure students get the opportunity at whatever level to showcase themselves at their best. Specifically, in terms of dyslexia, the State Examinations Commission has met with the national organisation. Everything is kept under review. They would point to the fact that, almost uniquely in the world, there is the spelling and grammar waiver, which is not in existence in other jurisdictions to the best of my knowledge. However, they have listened to and are hearing what is being said by the dyslexia association from a national point of view and they will keep it under review. It is important we would point to the accommodations that are currently in existence. If there is scope to do more going forward, there is scope to do more. It also includes the individual reader, the reading assistant, the word processor, a waiver from spelling and grammar, etc. Additional time for any candidate who is using a scribe is also provided for the time overhead in dictating answers. This is at a rate of ten minutes per scheduled hour or part thereof. That is not applicable, however, at leaving certificate level, particularly in English and Irish, given that there was a 20-minute addition of time given across the board in those subject areas. I am conscious of the importance of this scheme. We are aware of how it has opened up so many opportunities for young people. The State Examinations Commission has informed me it is keeping it under consistent review. It has shown that with its willingness to meet with organisations. The commission meets regularly with organisations which feel they have additional points to make. In this instance, the commission will keep it under review, specifically in relation to dyslexia, as the Deputy has referenced.	spk_87
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	Pupil-Teacher Ratio	dbsect_15	"As the Deputy will be aware, the school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the 2022-23 school year, in excess of 149,000 young people, including more than 18,000 children with special educational needs, were transported daily. In addition, school transport scheme services have been provided in the 2022-23 school year to almost 5,500 children who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €338.9 million. I appreciate that the school transport scheme is an important service for families and young people. For the 2023-24 school year, it remains that children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post-primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school or education centre as determined by the Department. Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Young people who are not eligible for school transport but who completed the application process on time are considered for spare seats that may exist after those who fall within the criteria have been facilitated. In addition, pending completion of the review of the school transport scheme, temporary alleviation measures at post-primary will be continued for the 2023-24 school year. Under these measures, transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school, who are attending their second nearest school, and who applied by 28 April and paid and entered their medical card details, or whatever the case might be, by 9 June. Officials in the Department meet with Bus Éireann regularly to discuss these matters. To plan for services for the 2023-24 school year, officials in the Department and Bus Éireann began the planning process in late 2022 and held numerous meetings to discuss the upcoming school transport requirements. I have also met with Bus Éireann on a number of occasions, most recently in the past number of weeks, on these matters. For the first time, the payment closing dates were brought forward to allow more time for Bus Éireann to source capacity for the upcoming school year.
              An extensive media campaign, which included advertisements in local and national media, was run by my Department in tandem with Bus Éireann's reminders to families and social media messaging to encourage families to apply and pay or enter medical card details on time. Both my Department and Bus Éireann will continue to engage throughout the summer months. The Bus Éireann family portal has closed for all applications and payments and will reopen on 30 June 2023. This closure is necessary to ensure Bus Éireann can process applications, arrange transport, assess all applications, determine whether they are eligible or concessionary, and cater for temporary alleviation measures, TAMS, as soon as possible for the 2023-24 school year. Any application made after 28 April 2023 or any payment or medical card details submitted after 9 June 2023 are late applications. Where a late application is made, a ticket is not guaranteed. Bus Éireann plans to issue tickets to eligible students who have applied and paid or entered medical card details on time in July. After this allocation is complete, where seats are available, concessionary tickets will be issued. Pending completion of the school transport review, there will be no removal or downsizing of buses or routes for the 2023-24 school year."	spk_90
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	Pupil-Teacher Ratio	dbsect_15	I acknowledge the importance of the scheme. I know it myself as I come from a rural constituency. Very specific measures were taken to ensure there would be earlier allocation of tickets. For the first time, the payment closing dates were brought forward. The family portal to process applications is closed and it will reopen on 30 June 2023, which is imminent. This closure is necessary to ensure Bus Éireann can process applications, arrange transport, assess all applications, etc. Any applications made after 28 April 2023 or any payments made after 9 June 2023 are considered late applications. Specifically, in terms of the number, Bus Éireann is currently doing a body of work where we have found, for example, some applicants might have applied twice.

This reflects an increase of €443 million in core funding as well as more than €145 million in non-core expenditure. This builds on significant increases in recent budgets and reflects the Government’s commitment to a quality, inclusive school system. As part of the cost-of-living measures to be enacted this year, €90 million was provided in one-off additional funding to schools to support increased running costs for primary and post-primary schools in the free education system. This was paid at a rate of 40% of schools’ basic and enhanced rates of capitation. The minor works grants, ancillary grants and ICT grants form part of the overall range of grants, which were specifically referred to by the Deputy. The minor works grant is provided to all primary schools to enable them to undertake small-scale minor maintenance and improvement works. It can also be used for the purchase of equipment, including supporting ICT provision. Funding of minor works grants to the value of €309 million has been issued since 2018. This includes a €30 million grant which was paid to all primary schools in April this year. Ancillary grant funding for primary and post-primary schools facilitates the provision of caretaker and secretarial services in schools. It is paid over a number of instalments, depending on the particular sector. In 2022, the Department provided €170 million ancillary grant funding, which included €98.6 million at primary level and €72 million at post-primary level. This grant funding to schools was increased in recent years to facilitate salary increases for secretaries and caretakers. All ancillary grant funding for the current school year has been paid in full. That includes all minor works and ancillary grants. The ICT grant funding is part of the overall digital strategy for schools and has involved an investment of €260 million since 2016, including the issue of €100 million in 2020 to enable schools to support the continuity of teaching and learning during the pandemic. This grant funding was last paid to primary and post-primary schools in December 2021 and involved an investment of €50 million at that stage. A further €50 million in grant funding for ICT infrastructure to address learners impacted by the digital divide also issued in late 2021 under Ireland’s national recovery and resilience plan through the NextGenerationEU facility.

I confirmed to the Deputy that all moneys in respect of the minor works payment have been paid. It is important to say that, over the past three years, not only have minor works grants been paid, but we have also on occasion seen double the money for minor works being paid to schools. Equally, throughout the Covid period in 2020, we saw a doubling of the money, or €100 million, being paid and, in the following year, we also saw €100 million, which was also a doubling of the money being paid, for ICT grants. It is not just that the money is being paid; in some instances it is being paid on the double. That is quite a significant investment from the Department. The Deputy referred specifically to school secretaries. She will be well aware, as will the House, of the change in circumstances relating to school secretaries and their wish to be paid distinct from the block grant that went to schools. A considerable body of work was undertaken by the Department on this matter, and I acknowledge the unanimity of everyone in the House on wanting to progress and do that work, which is well under way and has been greeted very positively by all within that sector.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	Pupil-Teacher Ratio	dbsect_15	Under the programme for Government, there is a commitment to make further progress in reducing the pupil-teacher ratios, PTRs, in primary schools. I am very pleased to have been able to introduce three successive PTR reductions in each of the past three budgets. I know the significance of this and that the Deputy is very conscious of it. Indeed, it is a measure that has been welcomed right across the board. Budget 2023 provided an additional €588 million in funding for education. This significant increase built on recent budgets and further enhanced the investment in primary and post-primary education. The significant increased investment reflects the Government’s commitment to a quality, inclusive, school system.For the current school year, the staffing schedule operates on a general average of 24 pupils to every one teacher, which is historically low. More favourable ratios are implemented for DEIS urban band 1 schools. Budget 2023 has implemented a further one-point reduction for the coming 2023-24 school year. That will operate on a ratio of 1:23 pupils in September 2023. In budget 2021, I also introduced a three-point reduction in the retention schedule, which assists schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts. The recent announcement in budget 2023 will further reduce this retention schedule by virtue of the one-point improvement to the staffing schedule that helps to ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that fewer pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher. The numbers employed in our schools have now reached the highest ever. Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by more than 5,000 compared to the 2017-18 school year. This has led to a steady improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio and average class size statistics during this period. The latest figures in relation to pupil-teacher ratios show an improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 15.3:1 to 13.7:1 at primary level when comparing the 2017-18 school year to the 2021-22 school year. This compares favourably with the OECD pupil-teacher ratio, which is 1:15. In the same period, the primary staffing schedule improved from 27:1 to 24:1 for the current school year and will be 23:1 for the 2023-24 school year. Average class sizes in primary schools improved from 24.5 to 22.8 in the same period. The 2023 budget announcements will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes for the current school year and statistics on this will be published in the next few weeks. I am conscious of the staffing schedule and the need to prioritise teacher allocations in primary schools, given their vital role. I am looking at how best to make further progress in reducing the primary teacher ratio in the context of the overall programme for Government and the budget.	spk_102
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	Pupil-Teacher Ratio	dbsect_15	I want to be very clear that there have been significant advancements and improvements. The Deputy referred specifically to primary school education in the context of the current Government. Specifically in terms of capitation, I want to acknowledge that the demands at primary level are very different from the demands at post-primary level. The demands at post-primary level are very different from the demands at primary level. Notwithstanding that, I want to point to some of the advances in primary education. As I have already mentioned - historically this has never happened before - in three successive budgets we have seen the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools being reduced. In September of this year it will be at a historic low of 23:1. No other Government has ever made an advancement of that nature over three years of Government. Second, free schoolbooks will be in operation in our primary schools from September of this year. This is a landmark move in education and it has never happened before. In terms of counselling services, which is an area that has never been provided for in primary school education, for the first time we are running a pilot across the country to make provision of that nature available. Hot school meals are being made available in our primary schools. This will be for the DEIS primary schools initially and will be in all our primary schools over time. There are significant advancements in the area of education for primary schools.	spk_104

The Deputy will be aware that the curricula are developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, which is constituted of all within the education sector. That includes all the voices in the education sector. The Deputy will be aware that the SPHE and relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programmes were done as a consequence of the work of the NCCA and were also borne of widespread consultation.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_16	As the Deputy has articulated, the SEC has specific responsibility for the operation, delivery and development of the State examinations. As part of its remit, the SEC provides the scheme of reasonable accommodations, which is known as the RACE scheme. This scheme facilitates access to the State exams by candidates who would have difficulty in accessing the exams or communicating what they know because of a physical difficulty, visual or hearing impairments or a learning difficulty. A physical difficulty could include medical, sensory, behavioural or mental health difficulties. The SEC advises that the focus of the RACE scheme is on the need to remove barriers to accessing the examinations while retaining the need to assess the same underlying skills and competencies as are assessed for all other candidates and applying the same standards of achievement as apply to all other candidates. A central tenet of the RACE scheme is to ensure equitable treatment for all candidates. The range of accommodations provided under the scheme has been designed to ensure fairness for all when facilitating candidates in demonstrating their level of achievement. The RACE scheme is operated by the SEC within the context of the annually issued RACE Instructions for Schools, which is the handbook on RACE. All applications for reasonable accommodations are considered within a published framework of principles. The SEC has advised that, in 2022, almost 25,000 candidates, or 19% of the total candidates, were provided with 30,000 individual accommodations under the RACE scheme. This is an increase over 2019, when 20,000 candidates, or 17% of the total, were provided with accommodation. From the 2016 to 2017 school year, the RACE scheme underwent fundamental reform. The reform focused on a number of areas and intended to ensure greater integration of the RACE scheme with overall Department of Education special educational needs policy, to enable greater access to the scheme, and to allow greater autonomy to schools and certainty to students about the examination supports available to them. These candidate-centred changes were informed by engagement with stakeholders. This included representatives of students, including those with special educational needs, such as the Dyslexia Association of Ireland, the Special Needs Parents Association, school management and leadership bodies, Government agencies, including the National Council for Special Education and the National Disability Authority, and statutory bodies. The RACE scheme continues to be subject to a process of ongoing review and improvement by the SEC. For example, recent enhancements to the scheme include the introduction of deferred examinations, within the policy context of the scheme, for leaving certificate candidates who miss their examinations in the main sitting due to close family bereavement, serious accident, illness or injury. A number of specific initiatives were introduced in 2023 for candidates with visual impairments. In addition to the fundamental reform for the 2016 to 2017 school year, and the ongoing process of review and improvement, the scheme will be subject to further review by the SEC in the context of reform of the senior cycle. One of the key priorities will be increasing the use of assistive technology to enhance access and integrity and to further support independent learning. In this regard, I am assured the SEC intends that there will be extensive consultation and engagement with all relevant stakeholders.	spk_83
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_16	I thank the Deputy. She is correct. I agree there is enormous importance attached to the RACE scheme. I understand the most recent full review was carried out in 2016-2017. In the interim, there have also been amendments, particularly for candidates who present as visually impaired. Also, schools have devolved authority to recommend to the SEC the supports available within the RACE scheme that should be put in place in the junior cycle and at leaving certificate level. The SEC, in general, accepts the recommendation of the school. Accommodations granted at junior cycle can also be reactivated at leaving certificate level. If RACE accommodation has not been granted, there is an opportunity for an independent appeal to that decision. The Deputy referred to those presenting with a visual impairment. A number of amendments have been made to provide, for example, for enlarged versions of the standard and modified examination papers. There is a Braille version of the standard and modified examination papers. Reading accommodations include the provision of an individual reader, reading assistant or exam reading pen. Writing accommodations include a word processor or recording device to record the candidate's responses and access to a scribe. The Deputy also specifically referred to dyslexia. The SEC has in place a spelling and grammar waiver. I also know there is an ongoing request for further review in that regard. It is my understanding the SEC has met representatives of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland. Everything is kept under constant review.	spk_85
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_16	I believe in this scheme. I believe fundamentally that we must do all we can to ensure students get the opportunity at whatever level to showcase themselves at their best. Specifically, in terms of dyslexia, the State Examinations Commission has met with the national organisation. Everything is kept under review. They would point to the fact that, almost uniquely in the world, there is the spelling and grammar waiver, which is not in existence in other jurisdictions to the best of my knowledge. However, they have listened to and are hearing what is being said by the dyslexia association from a national point of view and they will keep it under review. It is important we would point to the accommodations that are currently in existence. If there is scope to do more going forward, there is scope to do more. It also includes the individual reader, the reading assistant, the word processor, a waiver from spelling and grammar, etc. Additional time for any candidate who is using a scribe is also provided for the time overhead in dictating answers. This is at a rate of ten minutes per scheduled hour or part thereof. That is not applicable, however, at leaving certificate level, particularly in English and Irish, given that there was a 20-minute addition of time given across the board in those subject areas. I am conscious of the importance of this scheme. We are aware of how it has opened up so many opportunities for young people. The State Examinations Commission has informed me it is keeping it under consistent review. It has shown that with its willingness to meet with organisations. The commission meets regularly with organisations which feel they have additional points to make. In this instance, the commission will keep it under review, specifically in relation to dyslexia, as the Deputy has referenced.	spk_87
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_17	"As the Deputy will be aware, the school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the 2022-23 school year, in excess of 149,000 young people, including more than 18,000 children with special educational needs, were transported daily. In addition, school transport scheme services have been provided in the 2022-23 school year to almost 5,500 children who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €338.9 million. I appreciate that the school transport scheme is an important service for families and young people. For the 2023-24 school year, it remains that children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post-primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school or education centre as determined by the Department. Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Young people who are not eligible for school transport but who completed the application process on time are considered for spare seats that may exist after those who fall within the criteria have been facilitated. In addition, pending completion of the review of the school transport scheme, temporary alleviation measures at post-primary will be continued for the 2023-24 school year. Under these measures, transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school, who are attending their second nearest school, and who applied by 28 April and paid and entered their medical card details, or whatever the case might be, by 9 June. Officials in the Department meet with Bus Éireann regularly to discuss these matters. To plan for services for the 2023-24 school year, officials in the Department and Bus Éireann began the planning process in late 2022 and held numerous meetings to discuss the upcoming school transport requirements. I have also met with Bus Éireann on a number of occasions, most recently in the past number of weeks, on these matters. For the first time, the payment closing dates were brought forward to allow more time for Bus Éireann to source capacity for the upcoming school year.
              An extensive media campaign, which included advertisements in local and national media, was run by my Department in tandem with Bus Éireann's reminders to families and social media messaging to encourage families to apply and pay or enter medical card details on time. Both my Department and Bus Éireann will continue to engage throughout the summer months. The Bus Éireann family portal has closed for all applications and payments and will reopen on 30 June 2023. This closure is necessary to ensure Bus Éireann can process applications, arrange transport, assess all applications, determine whether they are eligible or concessionary, and cater for temporary alleviation measures, TAMS, as soon as possible for the 2023-24 school year. Any application made after 28 April 2023 or any payment or medical card details submitted after 9 June 2023 are late applications. Where a late application is made, a ticket is not guaranteed. Bus Éireann plans to issue tickets to eligible students who have applied and paid or entered medical card details on time in July. After this allocation is complete, where seats are available, concessionary tickets will be issued. Pending completion of the school transport review, there will be no removal or downsizing of buses or routes for the 2023-24 school year."	spk_90

The numbers employed in our schools have now reached the highest ever. Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by more than 5,000 compared to the 2017-18 school year. This has led to a steady improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio and average class size statistics during this period. The latest figures in relation to pupil-teacher ratios show an improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 15.3:1 to 13.7:1 at primary level when comparing the 2017-18 school year to the 2021-22 school year. This compares favourably with the OECD pupil-teacher ratio, which is 1:15. In the same period, the primary staffing schedule improved from 27:1 to 24:1 for the current school year and will be 23:1 for the 2023-24 school year. Average class sizes in primary schools improved from 24.5 to 22.8 in the same period. The 2023 budget announcements will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes for the current school year and statistics on this will be published in the next few weeks. I am conscious of the staffing schedule and the need to prioritise teacher allocations in primary schools, given their vital role. I am looking at how best to make further progress in reducing the primary teacher ratio in the context of the overall programme for Government and the budget.	spk_102
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	Pupil-Teacher Ratio	dbsect_19	I want to be very clear that there have been significant advancements and improvements. The Deputy referred specifically to primary school education in the context of the current Government. Specifically in terms of capitation, I want to acknowledge that the demands at primary level are very different from the demands at post-primary level. The demands at post-primary level are very different from the demands at primary level. Notwithstanding that, I want to point to some of the advances in primary education. As I have already mentioned - historically this has never happened before - in three successive budgets we have seen the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools being reduced. In September of this year it will be at a historic low of 23:1. No other Government has ever made an advancement of that nature over three years of Government. Second, free schoolbooks will be in operation in our primary schools from September of this year. This is a landmark move in education and it has never happened before. In terms of counselling services, which is an area that has never been provided for in primary school education, for the first time we are running a pilot across the country to make provision of that nature available. Hot school meals are being made available in our primary schools. This will be for the DEIS primary schools initially and will be in all our primary schools over time. There are significant advancements in the area of education for primary schools.	spk_104

Among the commitments are: to achieve the target of at least 400 multidenominational primary schools by 2030 in order to improve parental choice; to expand and prioritise the transfer of viable schools to community national schools; and to work with communities to ensure the provision of clear, non-partisan information on the preparation for, and consequences of, the divestment process and to respond to queries raised. In recent years, there has been considerable progress towards increasing the number of multidenominational schools, with 52 of the 53 new primary schools and 44 of the 50 new post-primary schools established since 2011 having a multidenominational ethos. A number of patronage transfers have taken place in recent years, resulting in the provision of an additional 12 multidenominational community national schools. In addition, a Gaelscoil in Dublin transferred patronage from its Catholic patron to An Foras Pátrúnachta in 2021. This school offers parents of junior infants the choice of undertaking an ethics and morality programme or a Catholic programme. Separately, a Gaelscoil in Gorey under the patronage of An Foras Pátrúnachta changed to a multidenominational ethos on a phased basis from September 2022. Twelve primary schools have been established under the patronage divesting process, all of which have a multidenominational ethos. In two of the patronage divesting areas, the demographics increased sufficiently to warrant the establishment of new schools outside of the divesting process and new multidenominational schools have been established. While the focus of the Department is on progressing the schools reconfiguration process, the Department is continuing its efforts to identify suitable solutions in the remaining patronage divesting areas. In 2022, there were 166 primary schools with a multidenominational or interdenominational ethos. In March 2022, I announced that arrangements were being put in place in a number of towns and areas of cities that had no multidenominational primary schools to identify potential schools and engage with their school managements, staff and school communities with a view to identifying demand for a transfer of patronage. The pilot areas were across the cities of Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick and also Arklow, Athlone, Dundalk and Youghal. The council for education of the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference and the relevant bishops confirmed their willingness to engage and co-operate with the Department. The engagement at local level across the seven pilot areas was largely concluded at the end of quarter 1 of 2023. Two schools - one in Athlone and another in Dublin - will be transferring from Catholic patronage to the local education and training boards, ETBs, becoming multidenominational community national schools for the 2023-24 school year.
              The Department is hopeful that there will be a number of other transfers of patronage and changes of ethos to multidenominational in the short term. My Department is reviewing the pilot and considering the lessons and the process for providing multidenominational options for parents in other areas of the country. It is envisaged that the review will be undertaken over the course of the summer and, following consultation with relevant stakeholders, will be finalised and published in the autumn. The review will include any lessons from the process and outline a strategy and framework for delivering on the Government commitment to increase multidenominational provision."	spk_120
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_20	Deputies Troy and Ó Ríordáin referred to divestment. I absolutely appreciate their bona fides in relation to advancing this programme as quickly as possible. I acknowledge that there is a Government commitment to do that and that there has been co-operation from various partners, in the first instance, in respect of the pilot programme. Somewhere along the line it gets lost that 52 of the 53 new primary schools are multidenominational, and 44 of the 50 new post-primary schools are multidenominational. I hear the frustrations of Deputies Troy and Ó Ríordáin, and we have discussed the matter previously. Putting that to one side, significant learning will come from the pilot scheme. There is no doubt that it worked in some areas, but it did not work at all in other areas. That is being reviewed. Out of that there will be an action plan to do things differently and more proactively where we feel it did not work, and also to take the learnings from where it worked well. This is just one step in a longer process. We have the vision and the determination to advance it as quickly as possible. I do not know how DEIS found its way into this discussion.	spk_124

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_20	The DEIS programme is extremely important. It speaks to educational disadvantage. We have the single greatest number of schools now involved in the DEIS programme. There was a very clear and transparent process for schools that did not meet the criteria. There was an appeals process and significant resources were put in place. I acknowledge that there will be children who are attending schools that are not DEIS schools, and they are also at risk of educational disadvantage, so we have universal targets on free books, as I mentioned earlier, and we are running pilots. One of the pilot projects to provide counselling services in primary school is being run in the Deputy's area.	spk_128

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_20	I want to be very clear at the outset. There is to be no bullying or coercion here. The pilot that has concluded was purposefully set out to gather the thoughts and the views. I acknowledge that in some instances there was no desire for change, and in others, there was huge desire for change. I absolutely accept that there must be a balanced approach. I also accept what Deputy Ó Ríordáin has said in terms of the validity of those who are being consulted and delivering the widest type of consultation. I do not wish to keep repeating myself, but it is important that we can make an informed decision. Therefore, the pilot has been important so that we can see what worked, what did not work and, indeed, what might have worked if it had been done differently. That is the purpose of having the pilot. That is the purpose the current review of the pilot. We will then formulate an action plan going forward to fulfil the commitment that has been made.	spk_133

Mar Aire Oideachais, teastaíonn uaimse a chinntiú go ndéanfar soláthar cuí do dhaoine óga ar mian leo a gcuid oideachais a fháil trí mheán na Gaeilge. Mar chuid den Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge, tá mo Roinn tiomanta do dheiseanna a chruthú chun oideachas lán-Ghaeilge a leathnú lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá sé seo ag dul ar aghaidh i gcomhthéacs na bhfógraí maidir le bunú daichead is a seacht scoil nua ón bhliain 2019. Tugann an próiseas atá ann chun pátrúnacht na scoileanna nua seo a shocrú aird ar leith do bhunú Ghaelscoileanna, Gaelcholáistí agus aonaid lán-Ghaeilge. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. Where demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools, or the provision of a new school or schools. A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences, as well as other considerations such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area, are key to the decision-making process. Such analysis impacts whether, at post-primary level, a school will take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelcholáiste or whether, if English-medium, the school will include an Irish-medium unit. Where there is demand for an Irish-medium school, but not at the 600 to 1,000 pupil level, a lower threshold of 400 students may apply to Gaelcholáistí. Alternatively, an Irish-medium aonad may be established in an English-medium school. In 2019, measures were announced to increase access to Irish-medium education as part of the patronage process for primary schools, including that five new primary schools being established from 2020 have been designated for Irish-medium education. Outside of the patronage process for new schools, it is also possible for any post-primary school patron to contact my Department with a view to establishing an aonad. As regards the new policy for Irish-medium education outside of the Gaeltacht, public consultation concluded on 30 June. 	spk_135
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_20	The Deputy is correct. Where there is a desire to set up a school, the normal criteria is that it should have between a 600 and 1,000 pupil level available to it within the community. However, for the Gaelcholáistí, 400 is required. The aonaid are open to any school. They are entitled to approach the Department with the request to establish an aonad within the existing school. I know and accept that it is not everybody's preference in terms of the aonaid, and we had this discussion previously at committee, but there are opportunities maybe for us to look at how the aonaid could be supported in schools and how the differentiation between the main school and the aonad could work. The strategy is currently being worked on for oideachas Gaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. A singular key focus of that is how best to support the growth of the Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí.	spk_137
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_20	I will take the last question first. The Department has a huge openness to working with anybody. Where there would be seen to be an interest and enthusiasm to establish an aonad, in the first instance, obviously, the school itself can approach the Department. If a need is identified in an area not associated with the school, however, I would like to think there would be an openness in terms of collaboration for all of us to work together to maybe source an appropriate school or whatever the case might be. We want this to work. We will, therefore, take a very open and flexible approach but, obviously, we will need the co-operation of everybody in the education sector in an immediate area to support it. We will take a very proactive and definite approach in which we include as many people as possible. In terms of the aonaid, from my own experience, I am aware that even within my constituency, schools started out as aonaid and then developed into Gaelcholáistí. Indeed, we have seen that across the country. I will come back to the Deputy on the study. For example, part of the strategy is looking very specifically at ways of maybe supporting the aonaid, Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí. That is very much intrinsic in the strategy. I am happy to do any body of work that might be required. I will come back to the Deputy on the figure of 47 because I do not want to set him astray.	spk_139
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_20	Through Project Ireland 2040, we are investing €4.4 billion over the period 2021 to 2025 to add capacity and develop and upgrade school facilities across the country for the almost 1 million students and more than 100,000 staff involved in the education sector. The Department has a proven track record of delivery. During the period 2018 to 2022, just under 900 school buildings were completed. This includes nearly 100 building projects across County Cork and a total investment of more than €433 million in schools in the county. The key drivers of capital investment in the schools sector are demographic change, including keeping pace with delivery of necessary special educational needs accommodation and accommodation for Ukrainian pupils, particularly at post-primary level, alignment with housing provision, obviously, and climate action objectives. The Department completed more than 180 projects last year, including 20 in County Cork, within a challenging construction sector environment of high inflation, labour shortages and supply chain issues. This year alone, in excess of 300 school building projects are currently under construction, including 40 new school buildings and 260 projects at existing schools across the country. Some 25 school building projects are under construction in County Cork. There are a further 1,000 school building projects in the pipeline at various stages of planning and design and tender, of which 165 are projects in County Cork. Where accelerated delivery of accommodation is required, the Department utilises its modular accommodation framework to provide critical mainstream school places and places for students with special educational needs. There are currently 33 projects in this area under way in County Cork. In order to plan for school provision, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas. A geographical information system is used to analyse data from a range of sources, including Central Statistics Office, CSO, census data and child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. Requirements for additional school places, including in County Cork, are kept under ongoing review. The Department will continue to work with patrons and school authorities to support the operation of the school system in Cork and across the country, adding necessary capacity to cater for special educational needs provision, mainstream classroom requirements and accommodation for students from Ukraine and other countries under the international protection system.	spk_142
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_20	I thank all Deputies. I reiterate that more than 300 building projects are under way, including 40 new school buildings and 260 projects at existing schools across the country. Twenty-five of those school buildings are based in County Cork. That is almost 9%. A further 1,000 school building projects are in the pipeline at various stages, of which 165 are in Cork, which is almost 17% of all the building projects that are happening. Equally, in the modular accommodation framework, 33 projects are under way in County Cork. County Cork is being significantly catered for with ambitious projects. The Deputies raised specific issues on school places in the east Cork area. I acknowledge that there are difficulties with school of choice and availability of places in other schools too. That must be taken into consideration. In many instances, there is a preferred school but there are also other schools in the area that have availability. Notwithstanding that, we keep everything under review. I point to a particular example in the east Cork area, of Carrigtwohill Community College, CCC. The single biggest project of delivery of school buildings is happening in the three-school campus in Carrigtwohill. It is significant. I know my time is up and I will come back in.	spk_147

I am saying there is considerable work and all of the schools that have been referenced have made considerable accommodation and additionality with regard to places. The Deputy referred to a specific number. It may well be the case going forward and I accept that there may be a requirement for an additional school in the area. That is kept under constant review by the Department. It is very much to the fore of my mind. Specifically on places, the Department is doing analysis of whether there are issues with school of choice or availability of places in other schools in the east Cork area the Deputy referred to.	spk_151
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_20	I think they will be getting worried to hear Deputy O'Sullivan is crossing into a different constituency. As Minister, I believe it is crucially important that children and young people are actively supported to access education in its fullest forms. The Government recognises that the cost of preparing children for school each September can be a cause of financial difficulty and worry for many families. Earlier this year I announced the establishment of Ireland's first national primary schoolbook scheme. More than 558,000 pupils, enrolled in approximately 3,230 primary schools, including more than 130 special schools, will benefit from this new measure. This includes some 37,345 pupils enrolled in 248 primary and special schools in counties Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and Longford. In March, the Department issued extensive guidance to schools on the operation of the scheme. This is a landmark moment in Irish education and one that furthers our goal to provide free education for all and ensure that every child can benefit from free education. At a minimum, the scheme will provide free schoolbooks, workbooks and copybooks for all children and young people in recognised primary schools and special schools and will eliminate the cost of schoolbooks, workbooks and copybooks for parents of children and young people enrolled in the schools. Parents should not be asked to purchase, or to make a contribution to the school towards the cost of schoolbooks, workbooks or copybooks. The €53 million investment into schools is specifically for the cost of textbooks, workbooks and copybooks. Additional funding has been made available to schools to administer the programme. Depending on the size of the school, a certain number of days have been allocated to the school to ensure that the burden is not placed, for example, on the principal. Schools are free to employ anyone, whether a member of staff, somebody from outside the school or somebody on the board of management. It makes no difference. Those days are made available for them. The free schoolbooks measure builds on previous schemes like the book rental scheme, which was significant. More than 96% of primary schools engaged in that. Therefore, there is considerable experience in schools already. I acknowledge the work that is done every single day by schools on school book rental and now in this new sphere too.	spk_154
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_20	I thank the Deputy. I want to confirm that the provision is for all of our primary schools and special schools. There is no question. They are all included in it. Where there might be a need for additional resources or if the school finds it has additional students, or whatever the case might be, then as we have said in the guidelines that went out to the schools, direct contact has been made by the Department and provision has been made for that. I want to be clear that not a single penny is to be provided by parents or guardians for the schoolbooks. Specifically, this covers textbooks, workbooks and copybooks. That is meant to lift the burden from parents and guardians of costs of going back to school. It is an acknowledgement by Government of the need to support parents as they send their children to school. No moneys are to be paid for the books by parents or guardians.Any queries from individual schools should be directed to the Department.	spk_156
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_20	I agree; this is a landmark moment in education. It is the right thing to do. A huge financial investment is involved, but we had to take the first step and the Department deemed it appropriate that that would relate to primary education. I am conscious of the benefit the scheme provides for parents and guardians because I meet them frequently and visit schools throughout the country. It has been universally welcomed as a positive step forward. I acknowledge that when there has been a first step, one would hope there will be a second step. I have never made any apology in that regard, but I am conscious everything has to fit within a budgetary consideration. There are many competing demands across government and equally within my Department and, therefore, while it will be a matter for consideration, I cannot say when that will be or when we can achieve it. It is certainly an ambition, but I cannot give any commitment or guarantee as to when we will achieve it.	spk_158
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_20	"As the Deputy may be aware, for school planning purposes, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity, is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department’s projections of school place requirements. Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, including north Kildare, the Department makes an assessment of the existing capacity and identifies any requirement for additional provision. Where enrolment pressures arise, it may not always be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by factors such as a duplication of applications, where pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area; the school of choice, where pupils cannot get a place in their preferred school while places in other schools in the town or area are available; some towns or areas having single-sex schools that do not have places available to all pupils; and external draw, where pupils come from outside the local area. Through engagement with school authorities and patrons and having accounted for factors such as the duplication of applications, the Department has established a requirement exists for increased provision at schools in north Kildare. Officials are leading engagement with the relevant school patrons and authorities to put the necessary solutions in place for the 2023-24 and future school years. These include the use of existing spare capacity, the sanctioning of works for existing accommodation and the accelerated provision of modular accommodation. The close working between officials and schools and patrons in north Kildare has resulted in a significant number of additional places being made available. It is expected these will meet requirements, but the Department is continuing to monitor the situation. In addition to these immediate measures, the Department has been progressing a number of significant building projects in north Kildare.These projects include recently completed new school buildings in Maynooth and Naas. Additionally, a number of further new school buildings and extensions are at construction or planned, including in Prosperous, Kilcock, Maynooth, Celbridge, Leixlip, Naas and Clane. I assure the Deputy that the Department will continue to work with schools and patrons to ensure there is appropriate provision for all students in north Kildare and throughout the county for the 2023-24 school year and into the future.
               Teacher supply is a priority area of action for the Department given the importance of ensuring every child's experience in school is positive and he or she has available to him or her qualified, engaged and supportive teachers to support that child in his or her learning. The Department is undertaking a comprehensive programme to support the supply of teachers, including the provision of additional places in primary initial teacher education, ITE, programmes and additional places on post-primary teacher upskilling programmes in maths, physics and Spanish. The Teaching Transforms campaign continues to promote the teaching profession and encourage students to follow a career in teaching. It should be noted that at this point CAO first preference choices for post-primary teaching have increased this year by 11%. The Department meets regularly with the school management bodies and the teacher unions on this very important issue, and we will continue to work intensively with all stakeholders to develop and implement creative solutions to address the teacher supply challenges facing schools."	spk_166

Two schools - one in Athlone and another in Dublin - will be transferring from Catholic patronage to the local education and training boards, ETBs, becoming multidenominational community national schools for the 2023-24 school year.
              The Department is hopeful that there will be a number of other transfers of patronage and changes of ethos to multidenominational in the short term. My Department is reviewing the pilot and considering the lessons and the process for providing multidenominational options for parents in other areas of the country. It is envisaged that the review will be undertaken over the course of the summer and, following consultation with relevant stakeholders, will be finalised and published in the autumn. The review will include any lessons from the process and outline a strategy and framework for delivering on the Government commitment to increase multidenominational provision."	spk_120

I absolutely appreciate their bona fides in relation to advancing this programme as quickly as possible. I acknowledge that there is a Government commitment to do that and that there has been co-operation from various partners, in the first instance, in respect of the pilot programme. Somewhere along the line it gets lost that 52 of the 53 new primary schools are multidenominational, and 44 of the 50 new post-primary schools are multidenominational. I hear the frustrations of Deputies Troy and Ó Ríordáin, and we have discussed the matter previously. Putting that to one side, significant learning will come from the pilot scheme. There is no doubt that it worked in some areas, but it did not work at all in other areas. That is being reviewed. Out of that there will be an action plan to do things differently and more proactively where we feel it did not work, and also to take the learnings from where it worked well. This is just one step in a longer process. We have the vision and the determination to advance it as quickly as possible. I do not know how DEIS found its way into this discussion.	spk_124

We have the single greatest number of schools now involved in the DEIS programme. There was a very clear and transparent process for schools that did not meet the criteria. There was an appeals process and significant resources were put in place. I acknowledge that there will be children who are attending schools that are not DEIS schools, and they are also at risk of educational disadvantage, so we have universal targets on free books, as I mentioned earlier, and we are running pilots. One of the pilot projects to provide counselling services in primary school is being run in the Deputy's area.	spk_128

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Patronage	dbsect_22	I want to be very clear at the outset. There is to be no bullying or coercion here. The pilot that has concluded was purposefully set out to gather the thoughts and the views. I acknowledge that in some instances there was no desire for change, and in others, there was huge desire for change. I absolutely accept that there must be a balanced approach. I also accept what Deputy Ó Ríordáin has said in terms of the validity of those who are being consulted and delivering the widest type of consultation. I do not wish to keep repeating myself, but it is important that we can make an informed decision. Therefore, the pilot has been important so that we can see what worked, what did not work and, indeed, what might have worked if it had been done differently. That is the purpose of having the pilot. That is the purpose the current review of the pilot. We will then formulate an action plan going forward to fulfil the commitment that has been made.	spk_133

Mar Aire Oideachais, teastaíonn uaimse a chinntiú go ndéanfar soláthar cuí do dhaoine óga ar mian leo a gcuid oideachais a fháil trí mheán na Gaeilge. Mar chuid den Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge, tá mo Roinn tiomanta do dheiseanna a chruthú chun oideachas lán-Ghaeilge a leathnú lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá sé seo ag dul ar aghaidh i gcomhthéacs na bhfógraí maidir le bunú daichead is a seacht scoil nua ón bhliain 2019. Tugann an próiseas atá ann chun pátrúnacht na scoileanna nua seo a shocrú aird ar leith do bhunú Ghaelscoileanna, Gaelcholáistí agus aonaid lán-Ghaeilge. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. Where demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools, or the provision of a new school or schools. A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences, as well as other considerations such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area, are key to the decision-making process. Such analysis impacts whether, at post-primary level, a school will take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelcholáiste or whether, if English-medium, the school will include an Irish-medium unit. Where there is demand for an Irish-medium school, but not at the 600 to 1,000 pupil level, a lower threshold of 400 students may apply to Gaelcholáistí. Alternatively, an Irish-medium aonad may be established in an English-medium school. In 2019, measures were announced to increase access to Irish-medium education as part of the patronage process for primary schools, including that five new primary schools being established from 2020 have been designated for Irish-medium education. Outside of the patronage process for new schools, it is also possible for any post-primary school patron to contact my Department with a view to establishing an aonad. As regards the new policy for Irish-medium education outside of the Gaeltacht, public consultation concluded on 30 June. 	spk_135
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	Scoileanna Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta	dbsect_23	The Deputy is correct. Where there is a desire to set up a school, the normal criteria is that it should have between a 600 and 1,000 pupil level available to it within the community. However, for the Gaelcholáistí, 400 is required. The aonaid are open to any school. They are entitled to approach the Department with the request to establish an aonad within the existing school. I know and accept that it is not everybody's preference in terms of the aonaid, and we had this discussion previously at committee, but there are opportunities maybe for us to look at how the aonaid could be supported in schools and how the differentiation between the main school and the aonad could work. The strategy is currently being worked on for oideachas Gaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. A singular key focus of that is how best to support the growth of the Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí.	spk_137
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	Scoileanna Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta	dbsect_23	I will take the last question first. The Department has a huge openness to working with anybody. Where there would be seen to be an interest and enthusiasm to establish an aonad, in the first instance, obviously, the school itself can approach the Department. If a need is identified in an area not associated with the school, however, I would like to think there would be an openness in terms of collaboration for all of us to work together to maybe source an appropriate school or whatever the case might be. We want this to work. We will, therefore, take a very open and flexible approach but, obviously, we will need the co-operation of everybody in the education sector in an immediate area to support it. We will take a very proactive and definite approach in which we include as many people as possible. In terms of the aonaid, from my own experience, I am aware that even within my constituency, schools started out as aonaid and then developed into Gaelcholáistí. Indeed, we have seen that across the country. I will come back to the Deputy on the study. For example, part of the strategy is looking very specifically at ways of maybe supporting the aonaid, Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí. That is very much intrinsic in the strategy. I am happy to do any body of work that might be required. I will come back to the Deputy on the figure of 47 because I do not want to set him astray.	spk_139
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	Through Project Ireland 2040, we are investing €4.4 billion over the period 2021 to 2025 to add capacity and develop and upgrade school facilities across the country for the almost 1 million students and more than 100,000 staff involved in the education sector. The Department has a proven track record of delivery. During the period 2018 to 2022, just under 900 school buildings were completed. This includes nearly 100 building projects across County Cork and a total investment of more than €433 million in schools in the county. The key drivers of capital investment in the schools sector are demographic change, including keeping pace with delivery of necessary special educational needs accommodation and accommodation for Ukrainian pupils, particularly at post-primary level, alignment with housing provision, obviously, and climate action objectives. The Department completed more than 180 projects last year, including 20 in County Cork, within a challenging construction sector environment of high inflation, labour shortages and supply chain issues. This year alone, in excess of 300 school building projects are currently under construction, including 40 new school buildings and 260 projects at existing schools across the country. Some 25 school building projects are under construction in County Cork. There are a further 1,000 school building projects in the pipeline at various stages of planning and design and tender, of which 165 are projects in County Cork. Where accelerated delivery of accommodation is required, the Department utilises its modular accommodation framework to provide critical mainstream school places and places for students with special educational needs. There are currently 33 projects in this area under way in County Cork. In order to plan for school provision, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas. A geographical information system is used to analyse data from a range of sources, including Central Statistics Office, CSO, census data and child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. Requirements for additional school places, including in County Cork, are kept under ongoing review. The Department will continue to work with patrons and school authorities to support the operation of the school system in Cork and across the country, adding necessary capacity to cater for special educational needs provision, mainstream classroom requirements and accommodation for students from Ukraine and other countries under the international protection system.	spk_142
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I thank all Deputies. I reiterate that more than 300 building projects are under way, including 40 new school buildings and 260 projects at existing schools across the country. Twenty-five of those school buildings are based in County Cork. That is almost 9%. A further 1,000 school building projects are in the pipeline at various stages, of which 165 are in Cork, which is almost 17% of all the building projects that are happening. Equally, in the modular accommodation framework, 33 projects are under way in County Cork. County Cork is being significantly catered for with ambitious projects. The Deputies raised specific issues on school places in the east Cork area. I acknowledge that there are difficulties with school of choice and availability of places in other schools too. That must be taken into consideration. In many instances, there is a preferred school but there are also other schools in the area that have availability. Notwithstanding that, we keep everything under review. I point to a particular example in the east Cork area, of Carrigtwohill Community College, CCC. The single biggest project of delivery of school buildings is happening in the three-school campus in Carrigtwohill. It is significant. I know my time is up and I will come back in.	spk_147

I did not mention the Patrician Academy in Mallow. Scoil An Athar Tadhg in Carrignavar and Ringaskiddy Lower Harbour National School are part of the programme. I am saying there is considerable work and all of the schools that have been referenced have made considerable accommodation and additionality with regard to places. The Deputy referred to a specific number. It may well be the case going forward and I accept that there may be a requirement for an additional school in the area. That is kept under constant review by the Department. It is very much to the fore of my mind. Specifically on places, the Department is doing analysis of whether there are issues with school of choice or availability of places in other schools in the east Cork area the Deputy referred to.	spk_151
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Textbooks	dbsect_25	I think they will be getting worried to hear Deputy O'Sullivan is crossing into a different constituency. As Minister, I believe it is crucially important that children and young people are actively supported to access education in its fullest forms. The Government recognises that the cost of preparing children for school each September can be a cause of financial difficulty and worry for many families. Earlier this year I announced the establishment of Ireland's first national primary schoolbook scheme. More than 558,000 pupils, enrolled in approximately 3,230 primary schools, including more than 130 special schools, will benefit from this new measure. This includes some 37,345 pupils enrolled in 248 primary and special schools in counties Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and Longford. In March, the Department issued extensive guidance to schools on the operation of the scheme. This is a landmark moment in Irish education and one that furthers our goal to provide free education for all and ensure that every child can benefit from free education. At a minimum, the scheme will provide free schoolbooks, workbooks and copybooks for all children and young people in recognised primary schools and special schools and will eliminate the cost of schoolbooks, workbooks and copybooks for parents of children and young people enrolled in the schools. Parents should not be asked to purchase, or to make a contribution to the school towards the cost of schoolbooks, workbooks or copybooks. The €53 million investment into schools is specifically for the cost of textbooks, workbooks and copybooks. Additional funding has been made available to schools to administer the programme. Depending on the size of the school, a certain number of days have been allocated to the school to ensure that the burden is not placed, for example, on the principal. Schools are free to employ anyone, whether a member of staff, somebody from outside the school or somebody on the board of management. It makes no difference. Those days are made available for them. The free schoolbooks measure builds on previous schemes like the book rental scheme, which was significant. More than 96% of primary schools engaged in that. Therefore, there is considerable experience in schools already. I acknowledge the work that is done every single day by schools on school book rental and now in this new sphere too.	spk_154
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Textbooks	dbsect_25	I thank the Deputy. I want to confirm that the provision is for all of our primary schools and special schools. There is no question. They are all included in it. Where there might be a need for additional resources or if the school finds it has additional students, or whatever the case might be, then as we have said in the guidelines that went out to the schools, direct contact has been made by the Department and provision has been made for that. I want to be clear that not a single penny is to be provided by parents or guardians for the schoolbooks. Specifically, this covers textbooks, workbooks and copybooks. That is meant to lift the burden from parents and guardians of costs of going back to school. It is an acknowledgement by Government of the need to support parents as they send their children to school. No moneys are to be paid for the books by parents or guardians.Any queries from individual schools should be directed to the Department.	spk_156
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Textbooks	dbsect_25	I agree; this is a landmark moment in education. It is the right thing to do. A huge financial investment is involved, but we had to take the first step and the Department deemed it appropriate that that would relate to primary education. I am conscious of the benefit the scheme provides for parents and guardians because I meet them frequently and visit schools throughout the country. It has been universally welcomed as a positive step forward. I acknowledge that when there has been a first step, one would hope there will be a second step. I have never made any apology in that regard, but I am conscious everything has to fit within a budgetary consideration. There are many competing demands across government and equally within my Department and, therefore, while it will be a matter for consideration, I cannot say when that will be or when we can achieve it. It is certainly an ambition, but I cannot give any commitment or guarantee as to when we will achieve it.	spk_158
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-29	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_27	"As the Deputy may be aware, for school planning purposes, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity, is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department’s projections of school place requirements. Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, including north Kildare, the Department makes an assessment of the existing capacity and identifies any requirement for additional provision. Where enrolment pressures arise, it may not always be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by factors such as a duplication of applications, where pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area; the school of choice, where pupils cannot get a place in their preferred school while places in other schools in the town or area are available; some towns or areas having single-sex schools that do not have places available to all pupils; and external draw, where pupils come from outside the local area. Through engagement with school authorities and patrons and having accounted for factors such as the duplication of applications, the Department has established a requirement exists for increased provision at schools in north Kildare. Officials are leading engagement with the relevant school patrons and authorities to put the necessary solutions in place for the 2023-24 and future school years. These include the use of existing spare capacity, the sanctioning of works for existing accommodation and the accelerated provision of modular accommodation. The close working between officials and schools and patrons in north Kildare has resulted in a significant number of additional places being made available. It is expected these will meet requirements, but the Department is continuing to monitor the situation. In addition to these immediate measures, the Department has been progressing a number of significant building projects in north Kildare.These projects include recently completed new school buildings in Maynooth and Naas. Additionally, a number of further new school buildings and extensions are at construction or planned, including in Prosperous, Kilcock, Maynooth, Celbridge, Leixlip, Naas and Clane. I assure the Deputy that the Department will continue to work with schools and patrons to ensure there is appropriate provision for all students in north Kildare and throughout the county for the 2023-24 school year and into the future.
               Teacher supply is a priority area of action for the Department given the importance of ensuring every child's experience in school is positive and he or she has available to him or her qualified, engaged and supportive teachers to support that child in his or her learning. The Department is undertaking a comprehensive programme to support the supply of teachers, including the provision of additional places in primary initial teacher education, ITE, programmes and additional places on post-primary teacher upskilling programmes in maths, physics and Spanish. The Teaching Transforms campaign continues to promote the teaching profession and encourage students to follow a career in teaching. It should be noted that at this point CAO first preference choices for post-primary teaching have increased this year by 11%. The Department meets regularly with the school management bodies and the teacher unions on this very important issue, and we will continue to work intensively with all stakeholders to develop and implement creative solutions to address the teacher supply challenges facing schools."	spk_166
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-06-20	dail	33	Education Costs: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_18	I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the issue of back-to-school costs. The Government will not oppose the motion. In a short while, I will attend the graduation ceremony for 100 migrant teachers who are graduating from the bridging programme in Marino Institute of Education. I express my gratitude to the speakers here who have facilitated my attendance at what is a great occasion of celebration for those graduates.I express my gratitude for their graciousness. I am conscious of the significant pressures that can face families and their budgets. From speaking with parents in schools around the country and in my home constituency, I know the return to school in September can bring particular pressure, especially, as many parents and guardians highlight to me, when a family is preparing to send more than one child back to school or college. Parents and guardians will always want to do the very best for their children and young people, especially when it comes to their children accessing education and the opportunity it offers. I am conscious that, as a Government, we must do everything possible to support them. It is for this reason I have introduced both universal and targeted measures to help parents and families with the cost of education, including the introduction of a landmark free schoolbook scheme for all primary school children, the reduction of school transport fees and increased capitation payments. It is our ambition in government to support a child through every milestone and to support families as they journey together. I will reflect on all that has been achieved in this regard. When a child enrols in a primary school, they will now be provided with all the books and other resources they need to learn and thrive free of charge. Aside from cost, it is one less headache for parents and guardians. They can expect to go into a colourful and exciting classroom in which the pupil-teacher ratio is the lowest it has ever been, meaning they can benefit from the best possible experience with their teacher. In the case of over 200,000 children, they can expect a free school meal and we have ambitions to expand this programme even further. If they are among the tens of thousands of children who use the school transport service, their ticket costs far less than it did before this Government came into being. We have ambitions to do more in coming years and budgets but this is a remarkable change to have made in little over three years. One of the most important measures in this regard has been the establishment of a free schoolbook scheme in all primary schools across the country. This new scheme will benefit over 588,000 pupils in 3,230 primary schools, including over 130 special schools. This is an historic moment and one which helps us to live up to the promise of free education. The scheme is supported by Government funding of over €53 million, which has been issued to all schools to purchase all schoolbooks, workbooks and copybooks for their students. Together with other Government measures, the scheme will make a huge difference to parents’ wallets and stress levels. It is an initiative I look forward to seeing advance in the coming years. The scheme adds to the measures which the Government has progressed in the area of social protection, including a bonus payment of €100 for all recipients of child benefit payments, an enhanced payment of the clothing and footwear allowance and the significantly expanded provision of free school meals from September 2023. I know from speaking with families that requests for voluntary contributions can place an additional burden. I want to be clear: where a voluntary contribution is requested, it must be made clear that there is no obligation on parents to pay it under section 64 of the Education Act, added to by the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. I know that most schools take this very seriously. I also know that schools must be funded to meet their running costs. This year alone, schools have received an additional payment of €90 million to meet any cost-of-living pressures. This is in addition to standard capitation funding and ancillary payments. These payments have been increased in recent budgets and it is our intention to seek further increases in future budgets as resources allow. For the September 2023-2024 school year, the Government has reduced the charge payable to access the school transport scheme. The charge will be €50 per pupil at primary school and €75 per pupil at post-primary, with a family cap of €125. This is a significant reduction relative to the previous family cap of €525. Eligible children holding valid medical cards or with special educational needs will remain exempt from paying the annual charge. I know from my engagement with families that the value of the school transport scheme cannot be overstated. In addition to helping parents to manage the myriad of pick-ups and drop-offs that are part of any family, the scheme provides great value for money and has positive impacts for the environment. Last year, more than 131,000 tickets were issued for mainstream services under the scheme and we look forward to an equally successful scheme in the coming school year. I restate my complete commitment to supporting parents and guardians and minimising costs for families. Significant progress has been made under this Government and I look forward to continuing the work with all Government colleagues to achieve this further.	spk_170
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	During my time as Minister for Education I have shown a strong commitment to addressing educational disadvantage. The Department’s statement of strategy sets out the vision and mission of the Department for an educational system where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach his or her fullest potential. It sets equity of opportunity in education as a goal and equality and inclusivity as fundamental principles. Successful delivery of this goal means that our school system will be open and welcoming for all students and that learners at risk of educational disadvantage in particular will be supported to achieve their fullest potential. As recently as January of this year, the Department published the latest in a series of reports on retention to leaving certificate level. The latest report measures the percentage of pupils who entered the first year of post-primary school in 2015 and who sat the leaving certificate examination in 2020 or 2021. Some of these were provided with calculated grades in 2020 due to Covid, as the Deputy will appreciate. The latest report is the 14th publication in a series of reports which cover a total of 24 years, beginning with the 1991 post-primary entry cohort of students. These reports build a continuous time series recording retention rate trends in post-primary schools over the last two to three decades. All the reports containing the information requested by the Deputy are available on the Department’s website. The latest report shows that 92.1% of the students who entered first year in 2015 received either a calculated grade in 2020 or sat the leaving certificate examination in 2020 or 2021. The report shows that 97.5% sat the junior certificate examination in 2018 or 2019. This latest retention rate of 92.1% to leaving certificate represents an increase of 0.6% on the retention rate for the 2014 post-primary entry cohort. A key action of my Department is continuing to address the retention gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools through the DEIS programme. The current reports provide further evidence of progress in this area. The retention rate for schools participating in the DEIS programme increased to 86.1%, a 1.3% increase on the DEIS retention rate in the 2014 entry cohort report. The gap in retention rates between DEIS and non-DEIS schools is currently 7.6%. That is an improvement on the 2014 cohort, where the gap stood at 8.6%.	spk_294
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	I appreciate the positive comment the Deputy made across a variety of different levels. It is important to note the school completion rate of in excess of 96% compared with an EU average of 84%, which speaks to the considerable achievement in this country on retention rates within schools. That is largely due to the considerable investment that has gone in. He referred to DEIS supports for our schools, with investment of more than €180 million last March, which was the single largest expansion of DEIS supports for our schools. We have specifically looked at initiatives like the provision of home school liaison officers, the school completion programmes, enhanced staffing through DEIS and all of that. The summer provision programme specifically looks at supporting children at risk of educational disadvantage and children with additional needs. Regarding children with additional needs, we are running a number of pilots to support students who want to transition from a post-primary school into further education opportunities. They are specifically for those with additional needs and considerable work is ongoing in that respect.	spk_296
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	We have more than 1,200 schools now in DEIS. One in four of all our students now benefit from DEIS supports. That is significant and we see its benefit. Keeping young people in school at a rate of 96%, compared with the EU, is quite an achievement. The Minister of State and I are very conscious about children and young people with additional needs. For that reason, we have a number of concentrated pilots. The Deputy is quite correct that when the right supports are put in place, children and young people have an opportunity to thrive. We see that in our own system. The Minister of State has articulated the variety of different special classes, special schools and additional supports that we are putting in place. We are also now putting in supports to transition from mainstream or special schools into further and higher education. I want to be clear that considerable supports have been put into schools to support Ukrainian students or new students arriving.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	The Government believes and is clear that a rise in the cost of living should never be a barrier to education. The Deputy will be aware that as part of the cost-of-living measures announced in budget 2023, the Government provided an additional €90 million to schools as once-off additional capitation funding. This investment, in addition to a range of other funds being made available to schools, sought to ensure that any increased operational costs for schools were not passed on to parents. In the context of the current cost-of-living crisis and the additional funding being made available to schools, I firmly believe that schools should not seek additional voluntary contributions from parents. All recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme benefited from this additional capitation funding in December 2022, which represents an increase of circa 40% of current capitation rates. The programme for Government contains a number of measures to help families address the cost of education. The standard rates of the capitation grant have increased by 7.5% in recent years. The standard rate of capitation for primary schools is now €183 per pupil and it is €316 per pupil in post primary schools. The Government has introduced a new scheme to provide free schoolbooks to children and young people enrolled in recognised primary schools, including special schools, which will greatly reduce the burden on these families and reflects the importance that the Government places on education. This scheme will ensure that parents and guardians of children in primary schools will not be asked to buy or rent any schoolbooks, workbooks or copy books in autumn 2023. In excess of 558,000 pupils enrolled in approximately 3,230 primary schools, including more than 130 special schools, will benefit from the scheme. This funding will also provide schools with an administrative support grant to assist with the roll-out of the programme. The programme for Government also contains a commitment to enable the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019. The overall aim of the Bill is to improve the level of engagement in the school community by inviting feedback, comment and observation from students and parents and by further developing a listening culture in our schools. One of the key concepts of the Bill is the need for a school to consult students and parents on individual school plans, policies and activities. This approach will help ensure that the various views of students and parents are heard in schools. The Bill also provides for schools to provide information to students and parents regarding voluntary contributions and how they are spent. While voluntary contributions can be requested by schools, it must be made absolutely clear to parents that there is no requirement to pay, and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own choice. There is no compulsion to pay.	spk_300
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	I want to be clear that section 64 of the Education Act, added to by the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, explicitly prohibits the charging of admission and enrolment fees in our schools. No fee can be charged for instruction in any subject that is on the school curriculum. There is absolutely no charge for education from that point of view. The Deputy referred to schools that might face challenges. I want to be clear, as I articulated earlier, that significant funding is available to schools. We have seen increases in student capitation of more than 7.5% in the last couple of years. We have seen €90 million extra being made available, with a 40% uplift in the capitation fees being paid to schools. Regarding voluntary contributions, I want to be clear that there is absolutely no compulsion on parents and guardians to provide any type of contribution to the school. It is explicitly underlined in section 64 of the Education Act that education in its purest sense is free of charge.	spk_302
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	I want to be very clear. The Government has been very cognisant of the demands placed on parents. The Deputy will be aware that this September the free schoolbooks programme will be rolled out in all our primary schools. We have had an expansion of DEIS with additional supports going into schools, and the hot school meals programme is being rolled out to our schools. School transport is another cost for parents. The Deputy will be very familiar with the fact that we have sought a considerable reduction at a cost of €50 at primary school level and €75 at post-primary level, with a maximum payment of €125 per family. Considerable efforts have been made by the Government to support families who are facing difficulties and that is across the board. I want to be very clear about voluntary contributions. I was very clear when the €90 million in additional supports to schools was being made available. It is not at all preferable. I do not in any instance see why any parent should be asked to support a school with a voluntary contribution. The Deputy raised the point about schools finding it difficult to manage. If an individual school has an issue to manage, it is entitled to contact the financial support services unit, and schools do so. I visit schools the length and breadth of the country. The issue was acknowledged in the €90 million additional money made available to schools this year with regard to energy costs and the increase of 7.5% in capitation.	spk_304
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	The Department has a considerable record in the delivery of schools buildings. More than 180 projects were completed last year to the highest standards. This year alone 300 school building projects are on hand, including 40 new school buildings and 260 projects of additional accommodation of various types. Under Project Ireland 2040, we are investing €4.4 billion between now and 2025 to add capacity and develop and upgrade school facilities throughout the country for the almost 1 million students and 100,000 staff who attend our schools. Key priorities for the Department are supporting the operation of the school system and adding necessary capacity to cater for special education needs provision, mainstream demographics and catering for students from Ukraine and other countries under the international protection system. As the Deputy will be aware, an agreement was secured with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform in recent weeks to guarantee and support the roll-out and continuation of the Department’s ambitious school building programme. The agreement reached on 5 April is facilitating the continued roll-out of urgently required school building projects in mainstream and special education settings, including projects that were temporarily paused. Officials from the Department have updated each of these schools on the formal arrangements and the next steps in respect of the delivery of their individual projects. The current status of all projects is listed on a county-by-county basis on  I wish to clarify that the school project to which the Deputy refers was not one of the projects temporarily paused due to capital funding pressures. The Department approved funding for the school under the additional school accommodation scheme. The project will provide two en suite mainstream classrooms and the responsibility for delivery of the project is devolved to the school itself. The project is at the design stage of the architectural planning process. The professional and technical officials in the Department have reviewed the school's design team submission and their recommendations have been shared with the school authority. Officials are engaging directly with the school to assist it in this regard to ensure this important project is progressed to the next stage of architectural planning and delivered as quickly as possible.	spk_306
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	As I have outlined, the school accommodation project was approved in 2020 and it has devolved to the school authority. The project is at stage 1. I understand there site-specific challenges for the delivery of the school building project. However, following a review of the project's design team submission by the Department's professional and technical officials the project proposal was deemed viable subject to two technical recommendations on site services and other engineering-related issues. The school authority was advised of these comments and the Department is awaiting the design team's response. To expedite this response officials from the Department have engaged directly with the school authority to clarify the issues, following which the project is expected to progress to the next stage of design. Ultimately, as the Deputy will appreciate, it will progress to tender and construction thereafter as quickly as possible.	spk_308
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	I accept and the Department accepts the need for the building to progress. I want to be clear that it has devolved to the school authority. It appears there are site-specific challenges. It appears there were two outstanding technical recommendations for the site. They have been communicated to the school authority. We await what further progress the school authority can make. It has been advised of the two challenges that have been raised. The Department is awaiting the design team's response. The Deputy will appreciate there are a number of stages that must be gone through to ensure that everything is as it should be and all of the demands and whatever the challenges might be can be overcome. Two specific challenges have been identified and the Department is awaiting the response of the design team on these.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	I assure the Deputy that the provision of school places to meet the needs of children and young people at primary and post-primary level, including children and young people with special educational needs, is an absolute priority for the Department. To plan for school place needs, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and utilises a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity, is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department's projections of school place requirements.	spk_312
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	I am. I know they have a joint system. Where forecasts indicate growing enrolments, the Department first considers available capacity within the existing schools. Where additional provision is needed, the options considered are the expansion of existing schools or the establishment of one or more new schools. In response to the projections of school place needs in Limerick city, the Department is providing significant additional post-primary capacity, including new 1,000-pupil school buildings for two recently established schools, Mungret Community College and Limerick ETSS, new school buildings for Laurel Hill Secondary School FCJ, Laurel Hill Coláiste FCJ, Ardscoil Mhuire and Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, as well as extensions at Castletroy College, Thomond Community College and Coláiste Mhichíl. These projects are providing state-of-the-art, modern accommodation to meet the needs of the growing number of post-primary students across Limerick city, including specifically designed provision to meet the needs of students with special educational needs. As the Deputy will be aware, a common applications system operates to manage the admissions process for post-primary schools in Limerick city. This system has worked very effectively to meet post-primary school place needs and is successfully administered by the Limerick Education Centre, which I acknowledge. The Department has been in close engagement with the centre and school patrons regarding the admissions process for the 2023-24 school year and is aware of the current situation with respect to first-year places in Limerick. The Department is also aware that a number of students did not initially receive an offer of a first-year place in a post-primary school in Limerick and identified a requirement for further increased provision at schools to meet this need. Following consultation, and arising in the first instance from the excellent co-operative approach taken by post-primary schools in the city, available capacity in Limerick city has risen significantly, with 11 of the schools having increased their available first-year places earlier this year, giving an additional capacity of more than 160 places.	spk_314
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	I acknowledge again that the common application system that operates in Limerick is a superb system and is one born of co-operation between all of the schools on the sharing of information. There is often a challenge where there are multiple applications across a number of systems. I want to acknowledge that in the first instance. I also want to acknowledge that, because of that system, issues were flagged in terms of the need for additional places. In that respect, there have been achievements, with 11 schools across Limerick city having agreed to increase their availability of first-year places to give an additional capacity of more than 160 places. In addition, both Thomond Community College and Limerick Educate Together Secondary School have recently agreed to take an additional class group each. This will increase available capacity by more than 50 first-year places. The 20 or more students to whom the Deputy is referring can be accommodated within this group and, in fact, it will mean there is additional free capacity of at least 20 places. It is considerable progress but, again, it has been helped by the common applications system.	spk_316
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_26	To be fair, we have seen considerable progress in Limerick and we are also seeing very considerable investment by the Department in either new school buildings or additional accommodation. I have listed them for the Deputy, whether it is the 1,000-pupil school buildings for two recently established schools, Mungret Community College and Limerick ETSS, the new school buildings for Laurel Hill, including the Gaelcholáiste aspect of Laurel Hill, Ardscoil Mhuire and Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, as well as extensions at Castletroy College, Thomond Community College and Coláiste Mhichíl. Specifically in terms of the additional places that have been made available, it is important to note that it would appear at this point that there will be additional capacity, rather than required capacity. I acknowledge both Thomond Community College and Limerick Educate Together secondary school in this regard and their agreement to add the additional classes. I also point out that schools are required under the Education Act to offer places in line with their admissions policy and to work through their waiting lists accordingly. Where a student accepts one of the newly-created places but already has a place in a different school, that original place will become available. Overall, the additional capacity being provided in Limerick city is expected to meet the need for first year places. Nevertheless, the Department will continue to monitor the situation to ensure there are sufficient places available to meet the overall requirements.	spk_318
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_28	During my time as Minister for Education I have shown a strong commitment to addressing educational disadvantage. The Department’s statement of strategy sets out the vision and mission of the Department for an educational system where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach his or her fullest potential. It sets equity of opportunity in education as a goal and equality and inclusivity as fundamental principles. Successful delivery of this goal means that our school system will be open and welcoming for all students and that learners at risk of educational disadvantage in particular will be supported to achieve their fullest potential. As recently as January of this year, the Department published the latest in a series of reports on retention to leaving certificate level. The latest report measures the percentage of pupils who entered the first year of post-primary school in 2015 and who sat the leaving certificate examination in 2020 or 2021. Some of these were provided with calculated grades in 2020 due to Covid, as the Deputy will appreciate. The latest report is the 14th publication in a series of reports which cover a total of 24 years, beginning with the 1991 post-primary entry cohort of students. These reports build a continuous time series recording retention rate trends in post-primary schools over the last two to three decades. All the reports containing the information requested by the Deputy are available on the Department’s website. The latest report shows that 92.1% of the students who entered first year in 2015 received either a calculated grade in 2020 or sat the leaving certificate examination in 2020 or 2021. The report shows that 97.5% sat the junior certificate examination in 2018 or 2019. This latest retention rate of 92.1% to leaving certificate represents an increase of 0.6% on the retention rate for the 2014 post-primary entry cohort. A key action of my Department is continuing to address the retention gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools through the DEIS programme. The current reports provide further evidence of progress in this area. The retention rate for schools participating in the DEIS programme increased to 86.1%, a 1.3% increase on the DEIS retention rate in the 2014 entry cohort report. The gap in retention rates between DEIS and non-DEIS schools is currently 7.6%. That is an improvement on the 2014 cohort, where the gap stood at 8.6%.	spk_294
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_28	I appreciate the positive comment the Deputy made across a variety of different levels. It is important to note the school completion rate of in excess of 96% compared with an EU average of 84%, which speaks to the considerable achievement in this country on retention rates within schools. That is largely due to the considerable investment that has gone in. He referred to DEIS supports for our schools, with investment of more than €180 million last March, which was the single largest expansion of DEIS supports for our schools. We have specifically looked at initiatives like the provision of home school liaison officers, the school completion programmes, enhanced staffing through DEIS and all of that. The summer provision programme specifically looks at supporting children at risk of educational disadvantage and children with additional needs. Regarding children with additional needs, we are running a number of pilots to support students who want to transition from a post-primary school into further education opportunities. They are specifically for those with additional needs and considerable work is ongoing in that respect.	spk_296
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_28	We have more than 1,200 schools now in DEIS. One in four of all our students now benefit from DEIS supports. That is significant and we see its benefit. Keeping young people in school at a rate of 96%, compared with the EU, is quite an achievement. The Minister of State and I are very conscious about children and young people with additional needs. For that reason, we have a number of concentrated pilots. The Deputy is quite correct that when the right supports are put in place, children and young people have an opportunity to thrive. We see that in our own system. The Minister of State has articulated the variety of different special classes, special schools and additional supports that we are putting in place. We are also now putting in supports to transition from mainstream or special schools into further and higher education. I want to be clear that considerable supports have been put into schools to support Ukrainian students or new students arriving. There are additional English as an additional language, EAL, hours and additional teachers coming into the system. It has been well resourced by the Department.	spk_298

I have listed them for the Deputy, whether it is the 1,000-pupil school buildings for two recently established schools, Mungret Community College and Limerick ETSS, the new school buildings for Laurel Hill, including the Gaelcholáiste aspect of Laurel Hill, Ardscoil Mhuire and Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, as well as extensions at Castletroy College, Thomond Community College and Coláiste Mhichíl. Specifically in terms of the additional places that have been made available, it is important to note that it would appear at this point that there will be additional capacity, rather than required capacity. I acknowledge both Thomond Community College and Limerick Educate Together secondary school in this regard and their agreement to add the additional classes. I also point out that schools are required under the Education Act to offer places in line with their admissions policy and to work through their waiting lists accordingly. Where a student accepts one of the newly-created places but already has a place in a different school, that original place will become available. Overall, the additional capacity being provided in Limerick city is expected to meet the need for first year places. Nevertheless, the Department will continue to monitor the situation to ensure there are sufficient places available to meet the overall requirements.	spk_318
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Textbooks	dbsect_32	I believe it is crucial that all children and young people are actively supported to access education in its fullest forms and I know that I am supported by the Government in this belief. Since June 2020, and over the past three budgets, I have secured funding to support measures aimed at achieving that goal. One of the most important policies in this regard has been the establishment of Ireland’s first free primary schoolbook scheme, which has been fully funded to provide free schoolbooks, workbooks and copybooks in primary schools and special schools. In excess of 558,000 pupils enrolled in approximately 3,230 primary schools, including more than 130 special schools, will benefit from this measure. This is a landmark moment in Irish education and one which furthers our goal to provide education for all and ensure that every child can benefit from free education. I know that getting young people back to school in September can be a struggle. The free schoolbooks scheme will eliminate the cost to families for schoolbooks at primary school, including workbooks and copybooks. In excess of €53 million has been issued to schools around the country and extensive guidance has issued to schools on the operation of the scheme. As the Deputy said, schools have received €96 per pupil, which is based on pupil enrolment figures. The cost of €96 per pupil was arrived at following extensive analysis of a range of data sources. This included analysis of over three years of data from schools involved in the pilot free books scheme, direct engagement with a sample of different types and sizes of schools and detailed analysis by the Department of a range of school book lists, as well as engagement with other previous external independent surveys. The implementation of the measure builds on the experience of schoolbook rental schemes currently in place for a number of years in some 96% of primary schools, and on the learning from the free schoolbooks pilot provided for the past three school years in more than 100 DEIS primary schools. Primary schools and special schools will continue to have the autonomy to choose books that meet their curricular requirements. The scheme will seek to ensure that value for money is achieved and that primary schools and special schools will be supported to implement the scheme in a way that best meets the learning outcomes for pupils.The Department engaged with all relevant stakeholders as to how the scheme will operate, including primary school management bodies, unions, the National Parents Council Primary, representatives of booksellers, schoolbook publishers, IBEC, Retail Ireland, the Small Firms Association, Barnardos and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. It also engaged with a number of schools directly, including some of the primary schools participating in the pilot DEIS free book scheme.	spk_320

I also outlined the process that was employed. Whether she accepts it or not, the process was borne of experience. As I said, we had three years of data, which is considerable, from the 100 primary schools that ran the pilot free schoolbook scheme. That was a considerable source of data. The process involved direct engagement with a sample of school types and sizes and detailed analysis of schoolbook lists by the Department. We also looked at the book rental scheme. This was a source of considerable expertise within our schools as 96% of schools avail of this scheme and manage it at a particular cost. All of that was included in the process. We also engaged with primary school management bodies, the National Parents Council Primary, the INTO, booksellers, book publishers and so on. To be very clear, the money covers textbooks, workbooks and copybooks. If there is a shortfall in schools, and this has been outlined to them, they have every opportunity to convey this to the Department and we will look at it on a case-by-case basis. We are confident of the figures and that confidence is based on the research that was available to the Department.	spk_322

A full evaluation of the first year of implementation of the scheme will be undertaken in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform in order to inform the guidance, implementation, cost efficiency and effectiveness of the scheme for future years. The sum of €96 was chosen as a consequence of how a pilot scheme was run for three years. It is quite significant to have a scheme, under the direction of the Department, run for three years. There was incredible learning from that as well as from the 96% of schools that participated in the book rental scheme.	spk_324

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, over 149,000 children, including over 18,000 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. There has been an increase of 21% in tickets issued to eligible students and 38% tickets issued on a concessionary basis in the current school year compared with the 2021-22 school year. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year for over 5,200 children who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €338.9 million. The school transport scheme is an important service for families and children. The purpose of the scheme, having regard to available resources, is to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. A review of the school transport scheme is under way. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. Significant consultation has been undertaken as part of this review. A public survey was administered for parents, guardians and students who use the service. A broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments were all consulted as part of this review. Phase one of the review examined the impact of eligibility criteria on mainstream pupils who were eligible for transport to their nearest school but attending their next nearest school. This report was completed in June 2021. For the 2023-24 school year, it remains the case that children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post-primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school or education centre. Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. In addition, temporary alleviation measures have been continued for the 2023-24 school year, pending completion of the review. Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated. Such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.	spk_327
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	I thank the Deputy and I appreciate the point she makes. I absolutely appreciate the importance of the school transport system for a whole variety of reasons for different people at different times, as the Deputy articulated. Specifically in respect of the topic, Bus Éireann will be reviewing applications and planning routes during the summer months for the upcoming year. It is important to acknowledge that the system is presently in train. The closing date for new applications for the 2023-24 school year was Friday, 28 April. The closing date for payment or entering medical details for tickets for the 2023-24 school year is Friday, 9 June. All detail will be in by Friday, 9 June. It is only after this time that Bus Éireann will know how many applications have been received and paid for, what bus size and how many bus places are required. At that point, services will be planned for the upcoming school year. I also want to say that pending completion of the review, there will be no removal or downsizing of buses or routes for the 2023-24 school year.	spk_329
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	On the cut-off point of 70 years of age, that is an operational matter for Bus Éireann. It is my understanding that Bus Éireann says it keeps it consistently under review. Specifically in terms of the wider appreciation of school transport and its importance, we have been very cognisant of that. Where we had the capacity last year there were no fees being requested. Now the fees have been reduced to €50 for primary and €75 for post-primary for the year's travel with a cap of €125 for the family. Specifically in respect of what Deputy Harkin raised, I want to be clear that in terms of having the fullest data available, the application was 28 April and all data in terms of medical details for tickets or whether people are in a position to pay will not be available to Bus Éireann until Friday, 9 June. I am going to be clear to the Deputy. We have given a commitment that until the review is completed, there will be no removal or downsizing of buses or routes for the 2023-24 school year. What happens afterwards, pending the review, happens after.	spk_332
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	I wish to advise the Deputy again, in the interests of context, that in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system using data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data to identify where the pressure for school places across the country, including Dundalk, will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at either primary or post-primary level. Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. We are conscious of that. In that regard, as part of the annual demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area. The most recent analysis undertaken by the Department indicates that 85% of the 314 school planning areas at primary level show static or decreasing enrolments for the period to 2026 compared with 2021. At post-primary level, 74% of school planning areas are anticipated to have increased enrolments for the period to 2029, with most expected to reach a peak within the next two or three years. Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through utilising existing capacity, extending capacity, or through the provision of a new school or schools. The expansion of existing schools is typically delivered by means of my Department's additional school accommodation, ASA, scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom accommodation and accommodation for pupils with special education needs is provided. It is open to all school authorities to make an application for additional accommodation through the ASA scheme. Based on analysis of school place requirements, in recent years my Department approved ASA scheme applications by St. Vincent's Secondary School and De La Salle College in Dundalk to provide additional mainstream capacity as well as increased provision for students with special educational needs. That has been provided for and the projects are under way. I wish to advise the Deputy that there is no current record of an application for additional accommodation from Ó Fiaich College. The Department will continue to work to advance current projects and to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements in Dundalk, both for the coming academic year and into the future.	spk_334
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	I thank the Deputy and appreciate how positively he speaks of the school. I salute and acknowledge the excellent work that takes place in the school every single day to deliver education and cater to students. I want to make clear that there is not an application with the Department. It is open to the school to make an application and it will be evaluated at that time. I especially acknowledge the work on inclusive education and providing for children and young people with additional needs. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, wishes to do similarly. There is not currently a specific application but if that were to change, we would analyse it.	spk_336
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	I appreciate this matter crosses two different briefs as there is a further education element to it as well. I also appreciate that the Deputy may well have had conversations about what the college is intending to do and what its vision is. All I can say is we have a considerable record in delivery of new builds and additional accommodation. There were 180 builds last year and there are 300 on hand at this time, 40 of which are brand-new school builds with the remaining 260 additional accommodation. We have a budget of €4.4 billion between now and 2025 for the delivery of the school building programme, so we have an ambitious programme. We recognise that everything in education is in a constant state of flux and the needs of schools change from time to time. I appreciate, therefore, that this may be a pre-emptive strike by the Deputy in terms of the needs of the school in question. We will see what is forthcoming from the school itself.	spk_338
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	The Deputy will recall that in May 2021 I launched Say Yes to Languages, a language sampler module for pupils from third to sixth class in all primary and special schools. The module aims to generate awareness among pupils of the range of languages used by their peers, support greater inclusion and appreciation of diversity in society and encourage uptake of languages at post-primary level. It runs for eight hours over a period of eight weeks. Participating schools are eligible for a grant from the Department of €400 per classroom, up to a maximum of €1,600 per school towards paying for visiting teachers and other resources or events that support the aims of the module. The module is administered by Post-Primary Languages Ireland, PPLI, on behalf of the Department. Say Yes to Languages has proven hugely popular with 430 schools with approximately 30,000 pupils participating in the first year and just under 700 schools with approximately 50,000 pupils participating in year 2. I understand PPLI has received very positive feedback from pupils expressing pleasure in learning to speak the language of friends and learning how other people live and about their cultures. Teachers have noticed the pupils are making connections between English, Gaeilge and their new languages as a result of the module. This has complemented and reinforced the emphasis on their oral language development and the transfer of language skills between languages, both of which are pivotal in our new primary language curriculum. Participation in the module has increased the enthusiasm of children about language learning. I am pleased with how schools have responded to the module for the benefit of their students. It is heartening to see so many schools signing up to participate and the wide range of languages they have chosen. The closing date for expressions of interest from all recognised primary and special schools to participate in the module in the 2023-24 school year call was last week, on 12 May. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the strong interest in this offering is continuing. I understand 1,168 schools, which is 36% of our primary schools, registered interest. This represents a significant increase on last year, so we are seeing an increase year on year. This initiative is reflective of the Government’s strong commitment to promote the learning and use of modern foreign languages. Languages Connect: Ireland’s Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education 2017–2026 aims to create a more engaging learning environment, improve attitudes of students towards foreign language learning and improve the quality of foreign language teaching.	spk_342
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	We have seen an incredible diversity of languages being chosen by schools. Some of them very much reflect the children and young people in the schools. Schools have autonomy to choose and decide on the language. We are fortunate to have teachers in place in our schools who are of Ukrainian background and have registered with the Teaching Council. We have seen considerable uptake, as I articulated, in the number of pupils. It has risen from 30,000 to 50,000, with projected figures for year 3 being even higher again. Schools will be confirmed, in terms of their application, on 16 June. It is hugely positive that we have seen more than 1,168 schools, or 36% of primary schools, express an interest. It is also work on the back of the new primary curriculum framework in which we are also bringing in the teaching of modern foreign languages. This scheme is a pre-emptive step in that regard. Great credit is due to all the schools for their enthusiasm.	spk_344
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	I will give him the data at the start, lest I forget. The proposed date is 16 June, at this point at any rate. We are possibly on target for that. There are criteria in place. The Deputy referenced geographic spread, which is hugely important and is one of the criteria. There is a range of school contexts, types of schools and so on. Diversity in the target languages applied for is also an element, so we have a great spread of languages.Many schools also have an internal capacity among their staff. The school must provide details of how it will engage in promotion and dissemination - in other words, the programme that the school initiates - and how it will encourage teachers and tutors to participate in training. It must commit to delivering modules within specified timeframes. It must commit to engage and communicate with PPLI. These criteria are the basis and priority will be given to those schools that feel they can meet them.	spk_346
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	"While the State Examinations Commission, SEC, is responsible for the operation, delivery and development of State examinations, I am very much aware of the importance for students, parents and education stakeholders of ensuring that the results of the 2023 leaving certificate are delivered in as timely a manner as possible. While it is not yet in a position to confirm the date of those results, I have informed the SEC that my wish and expectation is to see them being issued in August. I engage on an ongoing basis with the SEC - indeed, I will meet it again this week - and it is clear on this point. Last year was the first time since 2019 that written State examinations were undertaken by all students and the date for the issuing of results was influenced by a number of factors. I acknowledge the additional burdens that were placed on the SEC. These included a challenge in recruiting sufficient examiners, the welcome provision of a set of deferred examinations for candidates who experienced illness or bereavement, and the implementation of a post-marking adjustment, which gave effect to the commitment that results in 2022 would be no lower in the aggregate than in the previous year. Regarding examiners specifically, it is of note that examination candidate numbers are 12% higher than they were ten years ago while examiner numbers are close to 20% lower over the same period. While this is not a new issue, it has been exacerbated over the course of the Covid pandemic. The SEC has undertaken a comprehensive review of the issue of contract staff recruitment, which includes extensive engagement with stakeholders. The core objective of the review process is to increase substantially the number of teachers involved in examination work so that the experience is a positive one that enhances teachers' professional competence as well as their earning power. The SEC has established a working group, which includes representatives of the management bodies and teacher unions, to consider measures to ensure the availability of teachers in the required numbers for this critical work into the future. The cornerstone of the 2023 recruitment campaign is a new website where teachers can find all relevant information. Oral and practical examinations for the 2023 leaving certificate took place in March, April and May. I welcome that the SEC was able to recruit the required complement of examiners for these oral and practical components and that there was no issue with either. Applications for positions as written examiners continue to be accepted and we encourage as many as possible to apply. In recent years, there have been significant increases in the rates paid to examiners. Funding has again been provided for these rates in 2023.
               The typical earning range for a junior cycle examiner is between €4,858 and €5,010, while for leaving certificate examiners, it is between €7,721 and €10,844. These rates depend on the subject and the number of scripts marked. The SEC and my Department are appreciative of the co-operation of schools and teachers in the successful administration and assessment of the State certificate examinations each year. The SEC advises that the multifaceted recruitment efforts for the 2023 examinations are having a positive impact on the level of interest in examining positions for the written examinations, but the process is ongoing and examiners are still needed."	spk_348
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	Not for one minute do I underestimate the importance of the results coming out as early as possible. I acknowledge the work of the SEC, which stands over the integrity of the exams. The Deputy referenced the issue of examiners, but the SEC has additional responsibilities in terms of the provision of a deferred exam sitting. That deferral is right and proper. Everyone would agree that if, for an unfortunate reason, a student was not in a position to take the exams the first time around, he or she should have a second opportunity as long as particular criteria are met. Equally, a commitment was given that there would be no cliff edge, as it were, in terms of what was achieved for students during Covid. The post-marking element is another issue for the SEC. The SEC is working through applications. I am confident it will be in a position to make an announcement about the date before the 2023 leaving certificate, and I have made it clear that that should happen in the coming weeks. The oral exams and practicals are a positive indication that there was a sufficiency of examiners this year.	spk_350
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	The SEC is charged with overall responsibility for running this process and it has confirmed that it is still in the process. It has received a number of applications. We have seen a concerted effort from the SEC in terms of a significant increase in the rates being paid to examiners. This year, the typical earning range for a junior cycle examiner is between €4,858 and €5,010, while for leaving certificate examiners, it is between €7,721 and €10,844. These rates depend on the subject and the number of scripts marked. This is a significant uplift in the funding made available to correctors. The SEC has successfully overseen the orals and practicals this year with a sufficiency of examiners. The data on how many are available will have to come from the SEC. The Ukrainian politics subject is only starting in fifth year this year, so will not be examined now. It will also be a non-curricular subject. When the SEC has the data available to it, it will make a public announcement on these matters.	spk_352
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, more than 149,000 children, including more than 18,000 children and young people with special educational needs, are transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. There has been an increase of 21% in tickets issued to eligible students and 38% in tickets issued on a concessionary basis in the 2022-23 school year compared to the 2021-22 school year. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year for more than 5,200 children who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €338.9 million. The Department's school transport scheme is an important service. Its purpose, having regard to available resources, is to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remotely from their nearest schools.As the Deputy indicated, a review of the scheme is under way.  The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and its broader effectiveness and sustainability and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. Significant consultation has been undertaken as part of the review.  A public survey was administered for parents and guardians, for students who use the service and, probably more importantly, for those who do not use the service but who would like to.  A broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments were consulted. Phase 1 of the review examined the impact of eligibility criteria.  That report was completed in 2021.  Following consideration of this phase 1 report, the provision of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021-22 school year was approved for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but who were attending their second nearest school.  These measures have been continued for the 2022-23 school year and will continue for the 2023-24 school year. These measures mean that transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and who are attending their second nearest school, who applied for school transport by 28 April 2023 and who pay for a ticket or enter medical card details by 9 June 2023, which is the cut-off date. Phase 2 of the review was completed late last year. Phase 3 will be completed imminently.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_35	I thank the Deputy very much. I appreciate her personal interest in this. I am a rural Deputy. I very much understand the importance of the school transport scheme. I will be clear that, as I have said, the geographical criteria currently require a student to live within 3.2 km of their nearest national school and to attend that school. At post-primary level, students must live within 4.8 km of their nearest school and attend that school or the next nearest. That was a concession that we gave. However, I appreciate the point the Deputy is making. The objective is for the maximum number of young people to avail of the school transport scheme where possible. I assure the Deputy that the geographical issue is very much part of the review base. I also acknowledge that the scheme is important insofar as almost 150,000 young people currently avail of it. We have seen a considerable increase in the number availing of the scheme even in the last year. There was a 21% increase in the number of eligible students availing of it and a 38% increase in the number of concessionary places. We are also transporting 5,200 Ukrainian students. As a result of its importance, we have reduced the payment required to €50 for a primary school student, €75 for a post-primary student and €125 for a family ticket.	spk_356

It is important to again raise the point that, at post-primary level, students had to live within 4.8 km of and attend their nearest school, but we have extended provision to the next nearest school. If the next nearest school happens to be full, students will be accommodated to reach the next nearest school again. That is a point that is often lost. If your first nearest or second nearest school is full, that is, if you have applied to the school and there is no place available to you, you are eligible for transport to the third nearest or the fourth nearest school. That is an important consideration. We are showing as much flexibility as we possibly can. I will have to look at the specific case the Deputy raised with me earlier.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_36	The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, over 149,000 children, including over 18,000 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. There has been an increase of 21% in tickets issued to eligible students and 38% tickets issued on a concessionary basis in the current school year compared with the 2021-22 school year. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year for over 5,200 children who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €338.9 million. The school transport scheme is an important service for families and children. The purpose of the scheme, having regard to available resources, is to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. A review of the school transport scheme is under way. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. Significant consultation has been undertaken as part of this review. A public survey was administered for parents, guardians and students who use the service. A broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments were all consulted as part of this review. Phase one of the review examined the impact of eligibility criteria on mainstream pupils who were eligible for transport to their nearest school but attending their next nearest school. This report was completed in June 2021. For the 2023-24 school year, it remains the case that children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post-primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school or education centre. Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. In addition, temporary alleviation measures have been continued for the 2023-24 school year, pending completion of the review. Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated. Such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.	spk_327
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_36	I thank the Deputy and I appreciate the point she makes. I absolutely appreciate the importance of the school transport system for a whole variety of reasons for different people at different times, as the Deputy articulated. Specifically in respect of the topic, Bus Éireann will be reviewing applications and planning routes during the summer months for the upcoming year. It is important to acknowledge that the system is presently in train. The closing date for new applications for the 2023-24 school year was Friday, 28 April. The closing date for payment or entering medical details for tickets for the 2023-24 school year is Friday, 9 June. All detail will be in by Friday, 9 June. It is only after this time that Bus Éireann will know how many applications have been received and paid for, what bus size and how many bus places are required. At that point, services will be planned for the upcoming school year. I also want to say that pending completion of the review, there will be no removal or downsizing of buses or routes for the 2023-24 school year.	spk_329
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_36	On the cut-off point of 70 years of age, that is an operational matter for Bus Éireann. It is my understanding that Bus Éireann says it keeps it consistently under review. Specifically in terms of the wider appreciation of school transport and its importance, we have been very cognisant of that. Where we had the capacity last year there were no fees being requested. Now the fees have been reduced to €50 for primary and €75 for post-primary for the year's travel with a cap of €125 for the family. Specifically in respect of what Deputy Harkin raised, I want to be clear that in terms of having the fullest data available, the application was 28 April and all data in terms of medical details for tickets or whether people are in a position to pay will not be available to Bus Éireann until Friday, 9 June. I am going to be clear to the Deputy. We have given a commitment that until the review is completed, there will be no removal or downsizing of buses or routes for the 2023-24 school year. What happens afterwards, pending the review, happens after.	spk_332
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_37	I wish to advise the Deputy again, in the interests of context, that in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system using data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data to identify where the pressure for school places across the country, including Dundalk, will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at either primary or post-primary level. Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. We are conscious of that. In that regard, as part of the annual demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area. The most recent analysis undertaken by the Department indicates that 85% of the 314 school planning areas at primary level show static or decreasing enrolments for the period to 2026 compared with 2021. At post-primary level, 74% of school planning areas are anticipated to have increased enrolments for the period to 2029, with most expected to reach a peak within the next two or three years. Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through utilising existing capacity, extending capacity, or through the provision of a new school or schools. The expansion of existing schools is typically delivered by means of my Department's additional school accommodation, ASA, scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom accommodation and accommodation for pupils with special education needs is provided. It is open to all school authorities to make an application for additional accommodation through the ASA scheme. Based on analysis of school place requirements, in recent years my Department approved ASA scheme applications by St. Vincent's Secondary School and De La Salle College in Dundalk to provide additional mainstream capacity as well as increased provision for students with special educational needs. That has been provided for and the projects are under way. I wish to advise the Deputy that there is no current record of an application for additional accommodation from Ó Fiaich College. The Department will continue to work to advance current projects and to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements in Dundalk, both for the coming academic year and into the future.	spk_334
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_37	I thank the Deputy and appreciate how positively he speaks of the school. I salute and acknowledge the excellent work that takes place in the school every single day to deliver education and cater to students. I want to make clear that there is not an application with the Department. It is open to the school to make an application and it will be evaluated at that time. I especially acknowledge the work on inclusive education and providing for children and young people with additional needs. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, wishes to do similarly. There is not currently a specific application but if that were to change, we would analyse it.	spk_336
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_37	I appreciate this matter crosses two different briefs as there is a further education element to it as well. I also appreciate that the Deputy may well have had conversations about what the college is intending to do and what its vision is. All I can say is we have a considerable record in delivery of new builds and additional accommodation. There were 180 builds last year and there are 300 on hand at this time, 40 of which are brand-new school builds with the remaining 260 additional accommodation. We have a budget of €4.4 billion between now and 2025 for the delivery of the school building programme, so we have an ambitious programme. We recognise that everything in education is in a constant state of flux and the needs of schools change from time to time. I appreciate, therefore, that this may be a pre-emptive strike by the Deputy in terms of the needs of the school in question. We will see what is forthcoming from the school itself.	spk_338
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Departmental Programmes	dbsect_38	The Deputy will recall that in May 2021 I launched Say Yes to Languages, a language sampler module for pupils from third to sixth class in all primary and special schools. The module aims to generate awareness among pupils of the range of languages used by their peers, support greater inclusion and appreciation of diversity in society and encourage uptake of languages at post-primary level. It runs for eight hours over a period of eight weeks. Participating schools are eligible for a grant from the Department of €400 per classroom, up to a maximum of €1,600 per school towards paying for visiting teachers and other resources or events that support the aims of the module. The module is administered by Post-Primary Languages Ireland, PPLI, on behalf of the Department. Say Yes to Languages has proven hugely popular with 430 schools with approximately 30,000 pupils participating in the first year and just under 700 schools with approximately 50,000 pupils participating in year 2. I understand PPLI has received very positive feedback from pupils expressing pleasure in learning to speak the language of friends and learning how other people live and about their cultures. Teachers have noticed the pupils are making connections between English, Gaeilge and their new languages as a result of the module. This has complemented and reinforced the emphasis on their oral language development and the transfer of language skills between languages, both of which are pivotal in our new primary language curriculum. Participation in the module has increased the enthusiasm of children about language learning. I am pleased with how schools have responded to the module for the benefit of their students. It is heartening to see so many schools signing up to participate and the wide range of languages they have chosen. The closing date for expressions of interest from all recognised primary and special schools to participate in the module in the 2023-24 school year call was last week, on 12 May. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the strong interest in this offering is continuing. I understand 1,168 schools, which is 36% of our primary schools, registered interest. This represents a significant increase on last year, so we are seeing an increase year on year. This initiative is reflective of the Government’s strong commitment to promote the learning and use of modern foreign languages. Languages Connect: Ireland’s Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education 2017–2026 aims to create a more engaging learning environment, improve attitudes of students towards foreign language learning and improve the quality of foreign language teaching.	spk_342
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Departmental Programmes	dbsect_38	We have seen an incredible diversity of languages being chosen by schools. Some of them very much reflect the children and young people in the schools. Schools have autonomy to choose and decide on the language. We are fortunate to have teachers in place in our schools who are of Ukrainian background and have registered with the Teaching Council. We have seen considerable uptake, as I articulated, in the number of pupils. It has risen from 30,000 to 50,000, with projected figures for year 3 being even higher again. Schools will be confirmed, in terms of their application, on 16 June. It is hugely positive that we have seen more than 1,168 schools, or 36% of primary schools, express an interest. It is also work on the back of the new primary curriculum framework in which we are also bringing in the teaching of modern foreign languages. This scheme is a pre-emptive step in that regard. Great credit is due to all the schools for their enthusiasm.	spk_344
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Departmental Programmes	dbsect_38	I will give him the data at the start, lest I forget. The proposed date is 16 June, at this point at any rate. We are possibly on target for that. There are criteria in place. The Deputy referenced geographic spread, which is hugely important and is one of the criteria. There is a range of school contexts, types of schools and so on. Diversity in the target languages applied for is also an element, so we have a great spread of languages.Many schools also have an internal capacity among their staff. The school must provide details of how it will engage in promotion and dissemination - in other words, the programme that the school initiates - and how it will encourage teachers and tutors to participate in training. It must commit to delivering modules within specified timeframes. It must commit to engage and communicate with PPLI. These criteria are the basis and priority will be given to those schools that feel they can meet them.	spk_346
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_39	"While the State Examinations Commission, SEC, is responsible for the operation, delivery and development of State examinations, I am very much aware of the importance for students, parents and education stakeholders of ensuring that the results of the 2023 leaving certificate are delivered in as timely a manner as possible. While it is not yet in a position to confirm the date of those results, I have informed the SEC that my wish and expectation is to see them being issued in August. I engage on an ongoing basis with the SEC - indeed, I will meet it again this week - and it is clear on this point. Last year was the first time since 2019 that written State examinations were undertaken by all students and the date for the issuing of results was influenced by a number of factors. I acknowledge the additional burdens that were placed on the SEC. These included a challenge in recruiting sufficient examiners, the welcome provision of a set of deferred examinations for candidates who experienced illness or bereavement, and the implementation of a post-marking adjustment, which gave effect to the commitment that results in 2022 would be no lower in the aggregate than in the previous year. Regarding examiners specifically, it is of note that examination candidate numbers are 12% higher than they were ten years ago while examiner numbers are close to 20% lower over the same period. While this is not a new issue, it has been exacerbated over the course of the Covid pandemic. The SEC has undertaken a comprehensive review of the issue of contract staff recruitment, which includes extensive engagement with stakeholders. The core objective of the review process is to increase substantially the number of teachers involved in examination work so that the experience is a positive one that enhances teachers' professional competence as well as their earning power. The SEC has established a working group, which includes representatives of the management bodies and teacher unions, to consider measures to ensure the availability of teachers in the required numbers for this critical work into the future. The cornerstone of the 2023 recruitment campaign is a new website where teachers can find all relevant information. Oral and practical examinations for the 2023 leaving certificate took place in March, April and May. I welcome that the SEC was able to recruit the required complement of examiners for these oral and practical components and that there was no issue with either. Applications for positions as written examiners continue to be accepted and we encourage as many as possible to apply. In recent years, there have been significant increases in the rates paid to examiners. Funding has again been provided for these rates in 2023.
               The typical earning range for a junior cycle examiner is between €4,858 and €5,010, while for leaving certificate examiners, it is between €7,721 and €10,844. These rates depend on the subject and the number of scripts marked. The SEC and my Department are appreciative of the co-operation of schools and teachers in the successful administration and assessment of the State certificate examinations each year. The SEC advises that the multifaceted recruitment efforts for the 2023 examinations are having a positive impact on the level of interest in examining positions for the written examinations, but the process is ongoing and examiners are still needed."	spk_348

I acknowledge the work of the SEC, which stands over the integrity of the exams. The Deputy referenced the issue of examiners, but the SEC has additional responsibilities in terms of the provision of a deferred exam sitting. That deferral is right and proper. Everyone would agree that if, for an unfortunate reason, a student was not in a position to take the exams the first time around, he or she should have a second opportunity as long as particular criteria are met. Equally, a commitment was given that there would be no cliff edge, as it were, in terms of what was achieved for students during Covid. The post-marking element is another issue for the SEC. The SEC is working through applications. I am confident it will be in a position to make an announcement about the date before the 2023 leaving certificate, and I have made it clear that that should happen in the coming weeks. The oral exams and practicals are a positive indication that there was a sufficiency of examiners this year.	spk_350
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_39	The SEC is charged with overall responsibility for running this process and it has confirmed that it is still in the process.

These rates depend on the subject and the number of scripts marked. This is a significant uplift in the funding made available to correctors. The SEC has successfully overseen the orals and practicals this year with a sufficiency of examiners. The data on how many are available will have to come from the SEC. The Ukrainian politics subject is only starting in fifth year this year, so will not be examined now. It will also be a non-curricular subject.

Before I address the specific issues raised, it is important to provide an outline of the extent of the school transport scheme. It is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, over 149,000 young people, including 18,000 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools. There has been a significant increase in the number of those availing of the system, including a 21% increase in those deemed eligible and a 38% increase in those in receipt of concessionary tickets.

It is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and ensuring it serves students and their families adequately. Significant consultation is taking place as a consequence of the review.Also as a consequence of the review, a public survey was carried out in respect of parents, guardians and students who use the service and those who do not. A broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments, were consulted as part of the review. Phase 1 of the review has been completed. On foot of the results, we introduced a scheme whereby post-primary students who were attending their nearest or next nearest school would be eligible. Phase 2 has been completed. Phase 3 will be completed imminently. On the topic raised by the Deputy, Bus Éireann will review applications and plan routes during the summer months for the upcoming school year. However, it is important to note that there are two specific dates with regard to facilitating Bus Éireann to do its work. First, the application date for those who were interested in applying to the school transport system was 28 April. Second, the closing date for payment or providing medical details for tickets for the 2023-24 school year is Friday, 9 June. In fairness to Bus Éireann, it is only after this date that appropriate and complete knowledge will be available on the applications, having not just been received, but paid for. At that point, services will be planned for the upcoming school year. Pending completion of the review, there will be no removal or downsizing of buses or routes for the 2023-24 school year. However, if families have applied to attend their nearest school, with regard to ethos and language, and have been advised by the school authorities that it is full, the Department of Education will consider if students can be deemed eligible for transport to their next-nearest school. These families can submit details to the school transport section in the Department of Education, where their request can be assessed. The Deputy has referenced that, in his view, more than 50 young people would be making an application and asked what the provision might be by Bus Éireann. To be fair, the date for receipt of applications has passed. The Deputy has acknowledged there has been a reduction in terms of the moneys required, in that it costs €75 at post-primary level and €50 at primary level. These moneys are to be paid or details with regard to medical card are to be made available only by Friday, 9 June. A more complete judgment of the requirement will be made at that point.	spk_379
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	Rural Schemes	dbsect_42	I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to update him on school transport. I reiterate that all eligible pupils who have applied on time this year have been facilitated for the 2023-24 school year. In addition, there has been a 40% increase in the number of concessionary tickets issued to the relevant pupils for the current school year in comparison with the number issued for the 2021-22 school year. There are criteria, that is, the student is living 4.8 km from his or her nearest or next nearest school, but there is a review under way. We must allow the review to be completed. It would not be fair to make a unilateral decision on one specific school. It is important that we allow the review to run its course. We have made concessions, as an interim measure, while the review is up and running, with regard to eligibility for the student to attend his or her second nearest school. If it is a case that the student's first or second school is full and he or she can produce confirmation of such from the school, the student will be eligible for transport to the third-nearest school.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_45	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Before I address the specific issues raised, it is important to provide an outline of the extent of the school transport scheme. It is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, over 149,000 young people, including 18,000 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools. There has been a significant increase in the number of those availing of the system, including a 21% increase in those deemed eligible and a 38% increase in those in receipt of concessionary tickets. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year for over 5,200 children and young people from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €338.9 million. The school transport scheme is an important service for families and children and the Deputy has outlined that very well. The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of young people who reside remote from their nearest school. A review of the school transport scheme is under way. It is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and ensuring it serves students and their families adequately. Significant consultation is taking place as a consequence of the review.Also as a consequence of the review, a public survey was carried out in respect of parents, guardians and students who use the service and those who do not. A broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments, were consulted as part of the review. Phase 1 of the review has been completed. On foot of the results, we introduced a scheme whereby post-primary students who were attending their nearest or next nearest school would be eligible. Phase 2 has been completed. Phase 3 will be completed imminently. On the topic raised by the Deputy, Bus Éireann will review applications and plan routes during the summer months for the upcoming school year. However, it is important to note that there are two specific dates with regard to facilitating Bus Éireann to do its work. First, the application date for those who were interested in applying to the school transport system was 28 April. Second, the closing date for payment or providing medical details for tickets for the 2023-24 school year is Friday, 9 June. In fairness to Bus Éireann, it is only after this date that appropriate and complete knowledge will be available on the applications, having not just been received, but paid for. At that point, services will be planned for the upcoming school year. Pending completion of the review, there will be no removal or downsizing of buses or routes for the 2023-24 school year. However, if families have applied to attend their nearest school, with regard to ethos and language, and have been advised by the school authorities that it is full, the Department of Education will consider if students can be deemed eligible for transport to their next-nearest school. These families can submit details to the school transport section in the Department of Education, where their request can be assessed. The Deputy has referenced that, in his view, more than 50 young people would be making an application and asked what the provision might be by Bus Éireann. To be fair, the date for receipt of applications has passed. The Deputy has acknowledged there has been a reduction in terms of the moneys required, in that it costs €75 at post-primary level and €50 at primary level. These moneys are to be paid or details with regard to medical card are to be made available only by Friday, 9 June. A more complete judgment of the requirement will be made at that point.	spk_379
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-05-16	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_45	I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to update him on school transport. I reiterate that all eligible pupils who have applied on time this year have been facilitated for the 2023-24 school year. In addition, there has been a 40% increase in the number of concessionary tickets issued to the relevant pupils for the current school year in comparison with the number issued for the 2021-22 school year. There are criteria, that is, the student is living 4.8 km from his or her nearest or next nearest school, but there is a review under way. We must allow the review to be completed.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-29	dail	33	Confidence in Government: Motion	dbsect_2	There are myriad reasons I am proud to vote confidence in the Government. I will use my speaking time to outline briefly some of those reasons in my area of education. Simply put, the Government has progressed landmark reforms and investment in the education sector. All of them have been chosen to create the best possible opportunities and experiences for our children and young people, as well as to support the excellent staff working in the sector. Budget 2023 provided for an unprecedented investment in education of almost €10 billion. This funding has enabled the largest ever investment in special education, an area that now has 40,000 dedicated professionals working in it, supporting students across more than 2,500 special classes in the mainstream system and in 128 special schools. A new free schoolbook scheme for all primary and special schools has been initiated by the Government. This is truly a landmark moment in Irish education and one that will provide significant relief to working families across the country. Overall, this initiative alone will benefit more than 540,000 students and their families. In three successive budgets, the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level has been reduced, bringing it to an historic low of 23:1. As a teacher, I know the value of smaller classes and have been committed to making this happen. In every year in which I have presided as Minister, our primary students have benefited from smaller classes and more individualised access to their teachers. A further reduction of the ratio has also been achieved in DEIS urban band one schools, thereby ensuring schools with the greatest concentration of disadvantage have been able to access additional teaching resources. The DEIS initiative is a flagship programme to tackle educational disadvantage. The Government has provided for the largest ever expansion of the programme, which means one in four of our students now benefit from DEIS supports. In terms of wider student supports, it is important to note that a pilot programme for the delivery of counselling provision to primary school students is being rolled out this year. What of curricular advancements? There is no doubt that the Irish education system is one of world-class learners, thinkers and doers. That has been key to Ireland's development as a society and an economy.Of course, the Ireland of today looks significantly different from that of 100 years ago. We must move with these changes. It is for this reason that we have invested in curricular redevelopment in order to ensure that Irish schoolchildren and young people continue to develop the skills knowledge and attitudes they need to thrive in the 21st century. In recent weeks, the first ever primary curriculum framework was launched. Senior cycle review and reform was also launched. The past two years alone have seen positive, purposeful and proactive developments and initiatives in education. I assure the House that much more is to come.	spk_212
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-29	dail	33	Education and the School Building Programme: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	At the outset, I would like to be associated with Deputy Ó Ríordáin's words on the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach. I remember her with great fondness and have had the opportunity to say so in this House. She was truly a visionary woman who made an extraordinary contribution to the world of education. We are certainly the lesser for her passing. I acknowledge that in the context of what the Labour Party is doing here today. I am very appreciative of the opportunity to acknowledge very sincerely all that occurs and all that happens in our schools every single day along with all the staff do to best support children and young people in the education sector. It is important to note that, since its formation two and a half years ago, this Government has made truly record levels of investment available to our education system. Funding of almost €10 billion supports a myriad of actions and initiatives to ensure that every child and young person is supported to reach his or her full potential. This investment has occurred across every area of the Department’s activity, from school buildings to special education and curricular reform. I will use my time to update the House on just some of these initiatives.  Reference has been made to a school being so much more than a building, something of which I am very conscious. However, at the same time, I also recognise the need for, and benefit of, investment in our physical infrastructure. Under Project Ireland 2040, we are investing €4.4 billion over the period 2021 to 2025 to add capacity and develop and upgrade school facilities across the country for the almost 1 million students and more than 100,000 staff who learn and work in our schools every day. More than 180 school building projects were delivered during 2022. This included the accelerated delivery of modular accommodation to facilitate additional capacity in special classes and special schools to cater for more than 900 children in response to the increasing prevalence of special education needs. This ambitious programme was delivered notwithstanding the significant challenges arising from building cost inflation. Approximately 300 school building projects continued in construction at the start of 2023, the majority of which will be completed in 2023 or early 2024. This includes 40 new school buildings and more than 260 projects in existing schools. This is a very strong level of delivery of school building projects and reflects the Government’s priority for investment in education. Other key achievements under the school building programme in 2022 include: successfully supporting and facilitating the enrolment of 15,000 children from Ukraine in our primary and post-primary schools since March 2022; progressing 16 deep energy retrofit pathfinder projects in partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; enhancing the State’s strategic planning for school place delivery through geographic information systems; and establishing 16 regional education and language teams, REALTs, to facilitate enrolment of children from Ukraine.  However, these are challenging times across all areas of construction with high levels of construction inflation. In addition to the normal pressures on the school building budget, there are also additional pressures in the context of the requirement to accelerate delivery of accommodation for children with special education needs and also in respect of capacity for the continued inflow of Ukrainian and other international protection students, particularly at post-primary level where accommodation pressures are more acute.  I am very appreciative of the strong support provided by Government for our education budget. The Department's published national development plan allocation for 2023 is €860 million. Some 73% of this allocation is needed to cover expenditure on contractual commitments on the approximately 300 existing projects at construction carried forward from 2022 that I have mentioned. The Department's planning and building unit is currently assessing its work programme and priorities for 2023 in the context of its available funding. We are currently engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform in respect of these funding arrangements. I am appreciative of the support which has been offered by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in this regard. The Department has sought to reassure relevant school communities that school building projects that are currently on hold due to capital funding pressures will be progressed and delivered.At this point it is simply a question of the timing of that. The Department is well aware of the urgency of getting these projects delivered as quickly as possible. Regarding the Deputy's request to publish a list of delayed projects, it is best and appropriate for communications to be done at individual school level and that is the approach that has been taken. The Department has prioritised engagement with boards of management and principals before publishing wider information and will be providing a further update to individual schools when engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform concludes. In tandem with this, the Department’s planning and building unit will also be updating patron bodies and school management bodies at that stage.	spk_624
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-29	dail	33	Education and the School Building Programme: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	I will text for it. I apologise. That is my mistake. I will ensure it is included. The forthcoming NDP review to be undertaken later in 2023 will be key to dealing with the type of issues referenced in the motion regarding project roll-out in future years and addressing any capacity constraints at primary and post-primary level. I will turn now to other areas raised in the Private Members' motion. The provision of education for children with special needs is an ongoing priority for me as Minister for Education, for Deputy Madigan as Minister of State and for wider Government. This year’s budget for special education stands at more than €2 billion, the largest ever budget to be devoted to special education. This budget supports students across mainstream and more than 2,500 special classes and 128 special schools. Where possible, all students are supported in mainstream education, with additional supports such as support from SNAs and special education teachers as appropriate. At the same time, we recognise the specific role for specialist provision such as special classes and schools. For this reason, we have pursued dedicated measures to support new special classes and schools. These initiatives are bearing fruit with more than 600 new special classes sanctioned at primary level, almost 300 new special classes sanctioned at post-primary level and five new special schools established over the last three years. I reassure the House that both my Department and the NCSE remain committed to working to ensure that every child who requires a special class or special school place for the coming school year can access one. There are now approximately 20,000 special needs assistants making a valuable contribution to our school communities, through the provision of adult support to enable students with additional care needs to attend school. On average more than 1,000 additional SNAs have been allocated to schools over the last three years. This is in addition to the more than 19,000 special education teachers working across the education system. The Department is continuing to work on a number of strategies, in consultation with the education partners, particularly Fórsa, to support the work of SNAs in our schools. The SNA allocations for the 2023-2024 school year are being developed by my Department and it is intended this will be advised to schools as soon as possible in April, which is earlier than last year. Regarding leaving certificate reform, the Government is committed to ensuring that the leaving certificate meets the needs of Irish students and broader Irish society. As the House will be aware, together with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, we have launched a significant reform of the senior cycle, covering the leaving certificate established, the leaving certificate applied, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the transition year programme. At its core, this reform seeks to empower students, enrich the student experience and embed well-being into the curriculum. We have already progressed key measures under this plan, such as removing barriers between the three different leaving certificate programmes, appointing a programme delivery board and partners forum and commencing subject development work for new curriculums. The Government’s objective is to have at least 400 multidenominational schools in the primary system by 2030 to improve parental choice. In March 2022, pilot arrangements were put in place in a number of areas to identify potential schools and to engage with school authorities, school staff and the school communities with a view to agreeing on a transfer of patronage and change of ethos where there was sufficient demand for this. As the House can appreciate, this pilot has been put in place in order to facilitate reconfiguration within schools and to develop a better understanding of the issues that arise for schools that undertake this process. We are fully committed to learning from this process. It is worth noting that 52 of the 53 new primary schools established to cater for demographic demand since 2011 are multidenominational and 44 of the 50 new post-primary schools are also multidenominational. The establishment of a citizens’ assembly on the future of education will be the subject of a Government decision and resolutions of the Dáil and Seanad at the appropriate time. The question of when the assembly might commence depends in large part on how soon the current assembly concludes its work and submits its reports. My officials are looking at how best to appropriately input to the pre-assembly process, including through liaison with the Department of the Taoiseach and key stakeholders across school communities. The school transport scheme is a very significant scheme and is critically important to many ordinary families around the country. In the current school year, more than 149,000 children, including over 18,000 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. Bus Éireann is communicating with parents and schools directly regarding the scheme for the 2023-2024 school year, in addition to extensive media and social media campaigns, which I am sure the Deputies opposite will have heard. The programme for Government commits to reviewing the school transport scheme and a major review is currently under way. It is anticipated that the final phases of the review will be completed shortly. Regarding admissions, I have previously signalled my intention to review the provision that allows schools, if they so desire, to take into account a student’s connection to a school by virtue of a parent or grandparent having previously attended the school when deciding on an application for admission to that school. An important feature of the admission process is that all schools that are not oversubscribed must accept all applications. This is crucial in ensuring a fair, equitable and transparent process. As part of budget 2023, the Department is allocating more than €50 million to provide free books to primary school children and young people within the free education scheme. Regarding class sizes, I remind the House that in each of the past three years we have had a one-point reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level bringing it to an historical low of 23:1. This is just a flavour of the proactive progress the Department has made with more to be done.	spk_626
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	Oideachas trí Ghaeilge	dbsect_14	"As the Deputy will be aware, investment and expenditure on physical education, PE, halls is an element of the overall expenditure and investment in the school building programme. The provision of general purpose, GP, rooms and PE halls at primary and post-primary level, respectively, as well as outdoor hard play areas forms part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school. My Department provides different sized PE halls and GP rooms depending on the size of the post-primary or primary school. I stress that there has been no reduction in the size of GP rooms or PE halls provided for primary and post-primary schools, respectively, in new school buildings. At primary level, a 195 sq. m GP room is provided as standard as part of new eight to 16 classroom school buildings, with larger primary schools with 24 or more mainstream classes being provided with twice this size. At post-primary level, smaller, new post-primary school buildings are provided with a 406 sq. m PE hall, with schools designed for 450 or more students provided with a larger 594 sq. m hall. Again, there has been no reduction in the size of school halls in new school buildings and this policy has been in place for a significant number of years. GP rooms and PE halls form part of a suite of ancillary facilities provided as part of new school buildings. At primary level, new school buildings additionally include a library, a multi-purpose room, special education tuition rooms and offices. The accommodation provided for new primary schools to support children with special educational needs also includes a central activities space, a multi-activity room, a daily living skills facility and quiet spaces. At post-primary level, new school buildings include a GP room as well as a PE hall, social areas, pastoral offices, special education tuition rooms and a fitness suite. As at primary level, accommodation provided in new post-primary school buildings for students with special educational needs also includes significant ancillary facilities.  In addition, my Department’s design guidelines for all new schools provide for outdoor multi-use games areas. The level of play space provided varies with the size of school. For example, a new 24-classroom primary school with special education needs classes is provided with three ball courts and two junior play areas as well as a secure hard and soft play area and a sensory garden. In respect of new post-primary schools, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school will be provided with six ball courts and a secure hard and soft special education play area. 
               The accommodation and facilities provided as part of new school building projects have been designed to meet the curricular and operational needs of schools, including the delivery of the PE curriculum. At primary level, the general purpose room can be utilised to support the provision of PE but it is important to note that the PE curriculum permits schools flexibility in its implementation and supports a broad and balanced approach taking account of the varying indoor and outdoor facilities available. The main focus of resources over the past decade has been - and will be over the coming period - on the provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics, particularly at post-primary level and for special education needs provision. The Deputy will appreciate that the immediate priority of my Department is continued strong delivery to support the operation of the school system with particular regard to planning ahead for the 2023-24 school year and supporting special needs provision."	spk_104
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	Oideachas trí Ghaeilge	dbsect_14	I know the Deputy’s personal investment in the school. The fact that there is a new school development is very positive and I know the Deputy has personally engaged in that. The question concerns size. I can only confirm to the Deputy that this is the standard size that is being provided at primary level. A 195 sq. m GP room is provided as part of a new eight to 16 classroom building. Obviously, a larger school will get a larger GP facility. This is part of a further suite of measures that has been provided. In addition to the GP rooms and PE halls, for example, a library, a multi-purpose room, special education tuition rooms and offices are provided at primary level. Accommodation provided for new primary schools to support children with special educational needs also includes a central activity space, a multi-activity room, a daily living skills facility, quiet spaces and outdoor facilities.	spk_106

I hear what the Deputy is saying. I acknowledge that this is standard practice for all new school buildings. It is the recommended size from the planning and building unit. There is flexibility regarding issues around PE and so on, in that it is a combination of activities. The curriculum permits that element of flexibility. Even though the Deputy implied it in his question, there is no question of a reduction in size. I have set out the size and it is the same across the country.	spk_108

I fully support this commitment and I am working with my Department and stakeholders in this respect. In recent years, there has been progress towards increasing the numbers of multi-denominational primary schools, with the vast majority of new primary schools established in the past decade having a multi-denominational ethos. In March 2022, I announced that arrangements were being put in place in a number of towns and areas of cities that had no multi-denominational primary schools.This process sought to identify potential schools and to engage with school authorities, school staff and the school communities with a view to agreeing on a transfer of patronage and change of ethos, where there was sufficient demand for this. The ongoing pilot includes 63 schools in the cities of Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick and the Arklow, Athlone, Dundalk and Youghal areas.  The schools reconfiguration for diversity process, supporting transfers of schools to multidenominational patrons in response to the wishes of local communities, has been developed in order to accelerate the delivery of multidenominational schools across the country. Where a school transfers from the patronage of one patron to another, the school remains open with the same roll number and operating from the same school property. All State-funded primary schools follow a common national curriculum and are subject to the same rules and regulations. The Council for Education of the Irish Episcopal Conference and relevant bishops have confirmed their willingness to engage and co-operate fully with my Department in seeking to facilitate a more diverse school patronage in the towns and cities in the pilot. The Department has made available a number of independent facilitators, who are former senior inspectors, across the pilot areas, including Raheny, to work with the school patron and relevant school authorities at a local level. This work involves engagement with school authorities, school staff and parents with a view to agreeing on a transfer of patronage and change of ethos, where there is sufficient demand for this. This process is about providing information and engaging with, and seeking feedback from, the school community.  I have always been clear about the intention to examine anything learned from the pilot in order to inform future work. Over the next short while, my Department will pull together information on what worked well across the pilot and what could be done better. We will then work with all the relevant stakeholders to apply what has been learned to future phases of work. In respect of engagement with the three schools in Raheny, the facilitator has completed their information meetings with the relevant boards of management, principals, staff and parents of pupils in each school. Before and after each engagement with a stakeholder, the facilitator and patron’s representative engaged to consider the views expressed and queries raised. The facilitator has submitted their preliminary report-----	spk_110

Before and after each engagement with a stakeholder, the facilitator and patron’s representative engaged to consider the views expressed and queries raised. The facilitator has submitted their preliminary report based on their engagement with the relevant stakeholders to the school patron. The preliminary report was circulated to the respective Raheny school communities for information and they were invited to provide feedback and share their views with the facilitator via the dedicated reconfiguration email address. The facilitator is now in the process of finalising their report, following consideration of feedback submitted by the school community. After the school patron receives the facilitator’s final report, the patron can reflect on the level of demand as indicated in the report. The patron should then communicate with the schools on whether there is sufficient demand for transfer of patronage and change of ethos or whether the school community wishes to remain under Catholic church patronage.  There are 63 pilots. This is one. I fully accept that some of the pilots have worked much better than others. The process of reviewing the pilots as they have worked will be part of the undertaking of the Department. We are committed to doing that.	spk_113

I know the Deputy is fully invested in this process and very supportive of increasing the number of multi-denominational schools we have. The pilot covers 63 different schools and there is no doubt that it has reaped benefits in some areas. The basis of the pilot is that everybody is consulted, and a facilitator is accommodating that, and everybody gets an opportunity to express their view. The report is then formulated at the end. I will be honest and say the process has worked better in some areas than in others. It has been protracted and challenging in some areas and less so in others. For this reason, there will be a full and comprehensive review of how the process has worked, what changes can be made and what can be retained where it worked well. It is also important to acknowledge in this debate that of the 53 new primary schools inaugurated, 52 are multi-denominational and of the 50 new post-primary schools, 44 are multi-denominational. We are making progress. Where there have been issues with pilots, the full review will give us an opportunity to correct them in future. The pilots have been successful in some areas.	spk_115
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	Oideachas trí Ghaeilge	dbsect_14	It is acknowledged that candidates can experience many forms of trauma and adversity, such as serious illness and bereavement, and that this may happen around the time of the leaving certificate examinations and that they may be sitting examinations at a time that is not optimal for them. The State Examinations Commission, SEC, has responsibility for the operation, delivery and development of the State examinations. For the 2022 leaving certificate examinations, the State Examinations Commission provided an extended scheme of deferred examinations within the policy context of the reasonable accommodations at the certificate examinations, RACE, scheme. Until 2019, candidates who missed their leaving certificate examinations due to bereavement, or for any other reason, had no option but to sit their examinations the following year. However, that was then changed. In advance of the 2022 leaving certificate, the SEC undertook a comprehensive review of the broader issue of how best to support candidates experiencing trauma and adversity at examinations time. The review process included consultation and engagement with stakeholders and advocacy groups, as well as research into practice in other jurisdictions. For the State examinations in 2022, the completion of the review resulted in the extended eligibility for the deferred examinations to candidates unable to sit their examinations in the main sitting due to serious accident, injury or illness. Candidates who were absent from examinations on public health grounds due to Covid-19 also had access to the deferred examinations. In 2022, more than 61,000 candidates sat the leaving certificate. Of these, a total of 397 candidates who were eligible for access to the deferred examinations sat these examinations in some 30 regional centres throughout the country, across a number of subjects. Of the 397 eligible applications, 43 were due to bereavement, 84 due to serious medical condition and 270 on foot of public health advice due to Covid-19. These deferred examinations were of equivalent standard to the June examinations and ran up until 16 July. The results of these deferred examinations issued at the same time as the main examination results. There was no difference for the candidate, or for the end user of the results, between results attained in June and those attained in July.

Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as an gceist thábhachtach seo maidir le Gaelcholáiste an Chláir in Inis. Tá comhfhreagras faighte ag mo Roinn ó phátrún Choláiste Phobail na hInse, Bord Oideachais agus Oiliúna Luimnigh agus an Chláir, ag lorg faomhadh don aonad Gaeilge sa choláiste phobail, ar a dtugtar Gaelcholáiste an Chláir, a aistriú ina Ghaelcholáiste neamhspleách. Mar chuid den Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030, tá tiomantas déanta ag mo Roinn deiseanna a chruthú chun oideachas trí mheán na Gaeilge a leathnú lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. This is in the context of the announcement of the establishment of 47 new schools from 2019, which affords particular consideration to the establishment of Gaelscoileanna, Gaelcholáistí and aonaid lán-Ghaeilge as part of the patronage process for new schools. Most new post-primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of 600 to 1,000 students. A lower threshold of 400 students may apply to Gaelcholáistí, having regard to the alternative of establishing an Irish-medium unit or aonad in an English-medium school. This is a potential outcome from the patronage process for new schools established to cater for demographic need. It is also possible for any post-primary school patron to contact the Department to explore the establishment of an aonad in an existing school. As the Deputy may be aware, work on the development of a new policy for Irish-medium education outside of the Gaeltacht is now well under way in the Department. The policy on Irish-medium education outside of the Gaeltacht is part of the overall framework of the 20-year strategy for the Irish language and builds on the achievement of the policy on Gaeltacht education for 2017 to 2022. Included among the key objectives of the policy are the development of a clear policy on the establishment and sustainability of aonaid or sruthanna in existing English-medium post-primary schools to strengthen Irish-medium education provision and the exploration of how opportunities for the establishment of Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí can be increased as part of the patronage process. A public consultation process was launched in October 2022 to gather the views of stakeholders including young people, parents, education professionals, education stakeholders and Irish-language organisations. The first phase of this consultation, which included an online questionnaire and a call for written submissions, concluded on 30 January 2023.	spk_129

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_15	"As the Deputy will be aware, investment and expenditure on physical education, PE, halls is an element of the overall expenditure and investment in the school building programme. The provision of general purpose, GP, rooms and PE halls at primary and post-primary level, respectively, as well as outdoor hard play areas forms part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school. My Department provides different sized PE halls and GP rooms depending on the size of the post-primary or primary school. I stress that there has been no reduction in the size of GP rooms or PE halls provided for primary and post-primary schools, respectively, in new school buildings. At primary level, a 195 sq. m GP room is provided as standard as part of new eight to 16 classroom school buildings, with larger primary schools with 24 or more mainstream classes being provided with twice this size. At post-primary level, smaller, new post-primary school buildings are provided with a 406 sq. m PE hall, with schools designed for 450 or more students provided with a larger 594 sq. m hall. Again, there has been no reduction in the size of school halls in new school buildings and this policy has been in place for a significant number of years. GP rooms and PE halls form part of a suite of ancillary facilities provided as part of new school buildings. At primary level, new school buildings additionally include a library, a multi-purpose room, special education tuition rooms and offices. The accommodation provided for new primary schools to support children with special educational needs also includes a central activities space, a multi-activity room, a daily living skills facility and quiet spaces. At post-primary level, new school buildings include a GP room as well as a PE hall, social areas, pastoral offices, special education tuition rooms and a fitness suite. As at primary level, accommodation provided in new post-primary school buildings for students with special educational needs also includes significant ancillary facilities.  In addition, my Department’s design guidelines for all new schools provide for outdoor multi-use games areas. The level of play space provided varies with the size of school. For example, a new 24-classroom primary school with special education needs classes is provided with three ball courts and two junior play areas as well as a secure hard and soft play area and a sensory garden. In respect of new post-primary schools, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school will be provided with six ball courts and a secure hard and soft special education play area. 
               The accommodation and facilities provided as part of new school building projects have been designed to meet the curricular and operational needs of schools, including the delivery of the PE curriculum. At primary level, the general purpose room can be utilised to support the provision of PE but it is important to note that the PE curriculum permits schools flexibility in its implementation and supports a broad and balanced approach taking account of the varying indoor and outdoor facilities available. The main focus of resources over the past decade has been - and will be over the coming period - on the provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics, particularly at post-primary level and for special education needs provision. The Deputy will appreciate that the immediate priority of my Department is continued strong delivery to support the operation of the school system with particular regard to planning ahead for the 2023-24 school year and supporting special needs provision."	spk_104
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_15	I know the Deputy’s personal investment in the school. The fact that there is a new school development is very positive and I know the Deputy has personally engaged in that. The question concerns size. I can only confirm to the Deputy that this is the standard size that is being provided at primary level. A 195 sq. m GP room is provided as part of a new eight to 16 classroom building. Obviously, a larger school will get a larger GP facility. This is part of a further suite of measures that has been provided. In addition to the GP rooms and PE halls, for example, a library, a multi-purpose room, special education tuition rooms and offices are provided at primary level. Accommodation provided for new primary schools to support children with special educational needs also includes a central activity space, a multi-activity room, a daily living skills facility, quiet spaces and outdoor facilities.	spk_106

I hear what the Deputy is saying. I acknowledge that this is standard practice for all new school buildings. It is the recommended size from the planning and building unit. There is flexibility regarding issues around PE and so on, in that it is a combination of activities. The curriculum permits that element of flexibility. Even though the Deputy implied it in his question, there is no question of a reduction in size. I have set out the size and it is the same across the country.	spk_108
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	School Patronage	dbsect_16	The Government’s objective is to have at least 400 multi-denominational schools in the primary system by 2030 to improve parental choice. I fully support this commitment and I am working with my Department and stakeholders in this respect. In recent years, there has been progress towards increasing the numbers of multi-denominational primary schools, with the vast majority of new primary schools established in the past decade having a multi-denominational ethos. In March 2022, I announced that arrangements were being put in place in a number of towns and areas of cities that had no multi-denominational primary schools.This process sought to identify potential schools and to engage with school authorities, school staff and the school communities with a view to agreeing on a transfer of patronage and change of ethos, where there was sufficient demand for this. The ongoing pilot includes 63 schools in the cities of Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick and the Arklow, Athlone, Dundalk and Youghal areas.  The schools reconfiguration for diversity process, supporting transfers of schools to multidenominational patrons in response to the wishes of local communities, has been developed in order to accelerate the delivery of multidenominational schools across the country. Where a school transfers from the patronage of one patron to another, the school remains open with the same roll number and operating from the same school property. All State-funded primary schools follow a common national curriculum and are subject to the same rules and regulations. The Council for Education of the Irish Episcopal Conference and relevant bishops have confirmed their willingness to engage and co-operate fully with my Department in seeking to facilitate a more diverse school patronage in the towns and cities in the pilot. The Department has made available a number of independent facilitators, who are former senior inspectors, across the pilot areas, including Raheny, to work with the school patron and relevant school authorities at a local level. This work involves engagement with school authorities, school staff and parents with a view to agreeing on a transfer of patronage and change of ethos, where there is sufficient demand for this. This process is about providing information and engaging with, and seeking feedback from, the school community.  I have always been clear about the intention to examine anything learned from the pilot in order to inform future work. Over the next short while, my Department will pull together information on what worked well across the pilot and what could be done better. We will then work with all the relevant stakeholders to apply what has been learned to future phases of work. In respect of engagement with the three schools in Raheny, the facilitator has completed their information meetings with the relevant boards of management, principals, staff and parents of pupils in each school. Before and after each engagement with a stakeholder, the facilitator and patron’s representative engaged to consider the views expressed and queries raised. The facilitator has submitted their preliminary report-----	spk_110

Before and after each engagement with a stakeholder, the facilitator and patron’s representative engaged to consider the views expressed and queries raised. The facilitator has submitted their preliminary report based on their engagement with the relevant stakeholders to the school patron. The preliminary report was circulated to the respective Raheny school communities for information and they were invited to provide feedback and share their views with the facilitator via the dedicated reconfiguration email address. The facilitator is now in the process of finalising their report, following consideration of feedback submitted by the school community. After the school patron receives the facilitator’s final report, the patron can reflect on the level of demand as indicated in the report. The patron should then communicate with the schools on whether there is sufficient demand for transfer of patronage and change of ethos or whether the school community wishes to remain under Catholic church patronage.  There are 63 pilots. This is one. I fully accept that some of the pilots have worked much better than others. The process of reviewing the pilots as they have worked will be part of the undertaking of the Department. We are committed to doing that.	spk_113
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	School Patronage	dbsect_16	I want to be fair here. I know the Deputy is fully invested in this process and very supportive of increasing the number of multi-denominational schools we have. The pilot covers 63 different schools and there is no doubt that it has reaped benefits in some areas. The basis of the pilot is that everybody is consulted, and a facilitator is accommodating that, and everybody gets an opportunity to express their view. The report is then formulated at the end. I will be honest and say the process has worked better in some areas than in others. It has been protracted and challenging in some areas and less so in others. For this reason, there will be a full and comprehensive review of how the process has worked, what changes can be made and what can be retained where it worked well. It is also important to acknowledge in this debate that of the 53 new primary schools inaugurated, 52 are multi-denominational and of the 50 new post-primary schools, 44 are multi-denominational. We are making progress. Where there have been issues with pilots, the full review will give us an opportunity to correct them in future. The pilots have been successful in some areas.	spk_115

The State Examinations Commission, SEC, has responsibility for the operation, delivery and development of the State examinations. For the 2022 leaving certificate examinations, the State Examinations Commission provided an extended scheme of deferred examinations within the policy context of the reasonable accommodations at the certificate examinations, RACE, scheme. Until 2019, candidates who missed their leaving certificate examinations due to bereavement, or for any other reason, had no option but to sit their examinations the following year. However, that was then changed. In advance of the 2022 leaving certificate, the SEC undertook a comprehensive review of the broader issue of how best to support candidates experiencing trauma and adversity at examinations time. The review process included consultation and engagement with stakeholders and advocacy groups, as well as research into practice in other jurisdictions. For the State examinations in 2022, the completion of the review resulted in the extended eligibility for the deferred examinations to candidates unable to sit their examinations in the main sitting due to serious accident, injury or illness. Candidates who were absent from examinations on public health grounds due to Covid-19 also had access to the deferred examinations. In 2022, more than 61,000 candidates sat the leaving certificate. Of these, a total of 397 candidates who were eligible for access to the deferred examinations sat these examinations in some 30 regional centres throughout the country, across a number of subjects. Of the 397 eligible applications, 43 were due to bereavement, 84 due to serious medical condition and 270 on foot of public health advice due to Covid-19. These deferred examinations were of equivalent standard to the June examinations and ran up until 16 July. The results of these deferred examinations issued at the same time as the main examination results. There was no difference for the candidate, or for the end user of the results, between results attained in June and those attained in July. The provisional statement of results or the final certificate did not indicate which examination a candidate sat. In light of the experience of the 2022 leaving certificate, the SEC is evaluating the provision of deferred leaving certificate examinations under the RACE scheme. 	spk_123

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_20	I accept the points the Deputy has made. There are 63 pilots. It is important to remember, as I said previously when it was raised with me, that in some areas it has worked much better and has been a much stronger process than it has been in other areas. There have certainly been challenges and it has been more challenging in some areas than in others. It is for that reason that the Department has given an absolute commitment that there will be a full review of the process. Any learnings that we gain, we will obviously put to good use. It has been particularly complex in the area referenced by the Deputy. Notwithstanding that, I have also pointed to where we have had successes, for example, at Cornamaddy National School. It is the wish and the hope of the Department that there will be number of other transfers of patronage and changes of ethos to multidenominational schools in the short term. The pilots are up and running. We are awaiting the final report from the facilitator in regard to the area that the Deputy references.	spk_137
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_20	I cannot be any clearer. From the outset, we have been very clear that the purpose of the pilots is, obviously, that they would be successful in that they would glean for us an increase in multidenominational provision. Equally, however, we have been clear from the outset that there will be learnings from the pilots. A pilot is a pilot. There will be learnings and, obviously, we will put that to good use going forward. However, it is fair to say that the example the Deputy has given, and it was given here earlier this morning, has been particularly complex and particularly challenging. That has not been the experience in other instances. While that does not in any way diminish the challenges that have been presented in this area, notwithstanding that, it is only balanced to say that in other areas those difficulties were not found. Equally, in terms of multidenominational provision, particularly with new schools, it is important to remember that 52 of the 53 new primary schools are multidenominational and 44 of the 50 new post-primary schools are multidenominational.

It provides students with learning opportunities that strike a balance between learning knowledge and developing a wide range of skills and thinking abilities. Due to the cancellation of junior cycle examinations in 2020 and 2021 in response to the Covid pandemic, 2022 was the first year in which all subjects were examined under the junior cycle framework. Hence, while the junior cycle mathematics specification was implemented in 2018, it was examined for the first time in 2022. While the junior cycle framework is in the relatively early stages of its implementation, the reception and impact of the new courses being studied, and their assessment, is under review and evaluation. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, will conduct an early insights review of each newly introduced subject specification. These will gather feedback from school management, teacher-educators and interested parties in relation to the experience of the subject in question and associated assessment arrangements. For junior cycle mathematics, it is anticipated that this review will be initiated in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition, a team of independent researchers from the school of education at the University of Limerick has been commissioned by the NCCA to explore the implementation and impact of the framework for junior cycle. This is a mixed methods, multidimensional longitudinal research study, exploring the experiences of schools over a period of four years. The first report of this study was published by the NCCA in October last year. Findings from this research will inform the NCCA's ongoing work to support schools' implementation of the framework for junior cycle. Neither the State Examinations Commission, SEC, nor the Department refer to students passing or failing exam subjects. The grade achieved represents a student's achievement in the particular subject and should reflect the student's best efforts in that subject.The language of pass or fail may not best reflect a student's achievement. In relation to foundation level, the Deputy may be aware that under the junior cycle framework, engagement with course specifications is at a common level in most instances in the level 3 programme, which is the level taken by most junior cycle students.	spk_141

The project will provide for a two-classroom special education needs, SEN, base for the school. The project has progressed through the stages of architectural planning and is currently at stage 3, which is the tender stage. The school authority submitted the tender report to the Department on 8 February 2023. We remain committed to the delivery of this important project and, indeed, the projects that the Deputy mentioned earlier. I am appreciative of the strong support provided by Government for the education budget. My Department's published national development plan, NDP, allocation for 2023 is €860 million. High construction inflation remains a continuing feature of the construction sector for 2023. As part of its planning ahead for the remainder of 2023, the Department is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform in relation to capital funding pressures in order to continue to adequately support the operation of the school system with roll-out of school building projects to construction in 2023. I am appreciative of the support and engagement which has been offered by the Department and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in this regard. We are currently at an advanced stage with these discussions. Progress has been made and I am anxious to bring this issue to resolution quickly. I want to assure the Deputy and the relevant school communities that school building projects that are currently on hold due to capital funding pressures will be progressed and delivered. It is simply a question of timing in terms of the financial resource. I am well aware of the urgency in getting these projects delivered as quickly as possible. I know of the importance to the local school communities, two of which the Deputy referenced.

Right throughout Covid, our school buildings continued to be built. Last year, a significant number of buildings - 180 new buildings - were provided for. This year, there are 300 projects on hand to be completed by the end of 2023 or early 2024. We have to concede that the Department, like wider society, has been affected by the war in Ukraine, which has impacted the cost of materials. Within the Department of Education, we have provided capacity for more than 15,000 students from Ukraine, which is having its own impact, but with schools positively wanting to do that and graciously doing so. We have also accelerated the delivery of SEN. All of this is important work. We are 100% committed to the delivery of the schools that the Deputy has referenced. There is an issue around capital funding. We are in a positive engagement with the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and his Department on that funding being released as quickly and as soon as possible.	spk_149

They are part of a hugely ambitious programme that we have delivered on in the past, including right through Covid, and we are determined to deliver on it this year. We need additional funding to do that and we are in discussion and communication with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, and the Minister on it. I want to acknowledge that they also have demands across a variety of other issues and Departments. They are engaging with us on a positive basis, however, and I am confident that there will be a positive outcome to this. We are seeking to have that outcome in the shortest timeframe possible. The discussions and engagement are ongoing but we are committed to this, and at no stage have we ever said these projects will not continue. These projects will continue and the timing of them will be determined by the availability of funding from the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform.	spk_154

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_20	The project referred to by the Deputy is at tender stage. The project brief is for the construction of a 600-pupil, two-storey, post-primary school building, including general classrooms, specialist classrooms, assembly hall and all ancillary accommodation. The stage 2b submission for this project was approved in September 2021. Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board and its design team were authorised to proceed to tender upon completion of the pre-qualification process in October 2022. With the original planning permission close to expiring, a decision was made that a new planning application to incorporate additional elements, such as traffic management, was required for the project. This was lodged with Dublin City Council on 26 January 2023. Dublin City Council has since requested that the entire application be recommenced and resubmitted with the additional information. This planning application was resubmitted on 9 March. This project was approved to go to tender in October 2022 but is currently on hold to proceed due to capital funding pressures and the requirement to submit a new planning permission. My Department's published national development plan allocation for 2023 is €860 million. High construction inflation remains a continuing feature of the construction sector for 2023. Given the Department’s strong track record in recent years in delivering the school building programme, and our full utilisation of our budget every year, there is no margin to absorb inflationary pressures. As I have stated, my Department is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform on capital funding pressures to continue to adequately support the operation of the school system with the roll-out of school building projects to construction in 2023. I am appreciative of the support and engagement which has been offered by the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, and by the Minister in this regard. We are currently at an advanced stage with the discussions. Progress has been made and I am anxious to bring this to a resolution quickly. I reassure the Deputy and the relevant school communities that school building projects that are on hold due to capital funding pressures will be progressed and delivered. I am well aware of the urgency in getting these projects delivered as quickly as possible. We will be providing an update to individual schools as soon as possible. In tandem with this, the Department’s planning and building unit will also be updating patron bodies and school management bodies at that stage.	spk_159
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_20	I do not for one minute underestimate the enthusiasm of the school or the good work it does every day with its students and the wider school community. Confirmation of that and of the excellence of the delivery there every day are represented by the determination of the Department to deliver on this project. I have no issue, at an appropriate time, with taking the opportunity to visit the school. As I said, a new planning application has been submitted on the school. I want to be fair also when it comes to the constraints we have on funding but that is part of an ambitious programme of delivery that the Department has across the country. We have been impacted by a variety of different issues, including the war in Ukraine and the cost of materials. We must also make provision for more than 15,000 students from Ukraine and accelerate special educational needs provision. These are all things that everybody wanted us to do. We are in positive discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform and I am confident that those discussions will come to a positive conclusion in as fast a time as possible. I want to confirm again that this project, along with other projects, will proceed. We await the additional funding for same.	spk_161
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_20	I confirm once again that the projects that have been paused will go ahead. We are in constructive engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform. The delays are a consequence of our ambitious programme. More than 300 projects are to be completed this year or in early 2024, in addition to the 180 projects completed last year. Our Department, similar to other Departments, has been challenged by many of the issues that have impacted on wider society including the cost of materials due to the war in Ukraine; as I have already stated, the additional number of students who we absolutely welcome into our schools - more than 15,000 of them are from Ukraine; and the excellent and most important availability of special educational needs, SEN, places, all of which I believe every Member of the House would support. I acknowledge there are capital challenges, but I also acknowledge in the midst of those challenges, we are benefactors of positive engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, notwithstanding the challenges that Department has across a variety of sectors. The engagement is positive. It is going well. It is my intention, hope and expectation that engagement will conclude as quickly as possible.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_20	Tabharfaidh mé an freagra seo idir Bhéarla agus Ghaeilge. Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Ó Snodaigh as ucht aird a tharraingt ar an éileamh atá ar an oideachas lán-Ghaeilge faoi láthair. Mar Aire Oideachais, teastaíonn uaim a chinntiú go ndéanfar soláthar cuí do dhaoine óga ar mian leo oideachas lán-Ghaeilge dara leibhéal a bheith acu. Mar chuid den Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-30, tá mo Roinn tiomanta do dheiseanna a chruthú chun an t-oideachas lán-Ghaeilge a leathnú lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá sé seo ag dul ar aghaidh i gcomhthéacs na bhfógraí maidir le bunú 47 scoil nua ó 2019. Tá sé deimhnithe ag mo Roinn go dtugann an próiseas chun pátrúnacht scoileanna nua a shocrú aird ar leith do bhunú Ghaelscoileanna, Ghaelcholáistí agus aonaid lán-Ghaeilge. In order to plan for school provision and to analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system and data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where pressure for school places will arise. Where demographic data indicate additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances in each case and may be provided through utilising existing unused capacity in a school, extending the capacity of a school or schools or provision of a new school or schools. After it has been decided that a new school is required based on demographic analysis, a patronage process is run. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences and other considerations, such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area, are key to the decision-making process. Such analysis impacts on whether a school at post-primary level would take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelcoláiste or, if it is to be an English-medium school, whether it would include an Irish-medium unit. The year of establishment, patronage, model and language of instruction have yet to be determined for the new post-primary schools that have been announced and will serve the following two school planning areas in the general south Dublin area, namely Dublin 2 and Dublin 4, including Sallynoggin, Killiney and Cherrywood. While it is expected that the existing Gaelcoláistí in the general south Dublin area have sufficient school places between them to accommodate demand in the short term given the number of new Gaelscoileanna which have opened in recent years or are planned to open in the area, the Department is keeping the position under active review as these schools grow and the number of sixth class pupils in Gaelscoileanna increases. The opportunities for expansion of provision at existing Gaelcoláistí such as Coláiste Eoin and Coláiste Íosagáin is also relevant and the Department has written to the school patrons of Coláiste Eoin and Coláiste Íosagáin in this context. The Department is currently developing a new policy for Irish-medium education outside Gaeltacht areas. The policy will be informed by a consultation process. Phase 1 of that process, which involved online work, ran from October 2022 to January 2023. The second phase, which includes focus groups, is currently under way. A review of national and international literature on minority language education provision has also been commissioned along with research on Aonaid in Irish-medium education. This research will also inform the policy development process. Mar a dúirt mé, tá polasaí nua á fhorbairt ag mo Roinn don Ghaelscolaíocht taobh amuigh de na ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá comhairliúchán agus taighde suntasach déanta againn agus beidh an taighde seo go léir mar bhonn eolais cuimsitheach don phróiseas forbartha polasaí.	spk_186

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	School Patronage	dbsect_21	I acknowledge that I had a discussion with Deputy Ó Ríordáin on this issue earlier. As I said, the Government’s objective is to have at least 400 multidenominational schools in the primary system by 2030 to improve parental choice. I fully support this commitment and the Department is working in this regard. In recent years, there has been progress towards increasing the number of multidenominational primary schools, with the vast majority of new primary schools established to cater for demographic demand in the last decade having a multidenominational ethos. That should not be lost in the discussion. In March 2022, I announced that arrangements are being put in place in a number of towns and areas of cities that have no multidenominational primary schools to identify potential schools and to engage with school authorities, school staff and the school communities with a view to agreeing on a transfer of patronage and change of ethos, where there is sufficient demand. The schools reconfiguration for diversity process, supporting transfers of schools to multidenominational patrons in response to the wishes of local communities, has been developed in order to accelerate the delivery of multidenominational schools across the country. Where a school transfers from the patronage of one patron to another, the school remains open with the same roll number and operating from the same school property. All State-funded primary schools follow a common national curriculum and are subject to the same rules and regulations. The ongoing pilot process is engaging with 63 schools in the cities of Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick and in the Arklow, Athlone, Dundalk and Youghal areas. The Council for Education of the Irish Episcopal Conference and relevant bishops have confirmed their willingness to engage and co-operate with my Department in seeking to facilitate a more diverse school patronage in these towns and cities. The Department has made available a number of independent facilitators, who are former senior inspectors, across the pilot areas to work with the school patron and relevant school authorities at local level. This work involves engagement with school authorities, school staff and parents with a view to agreeing on a transfer of patronage and change of ethos, where there is sufficient demand. This process is about providing information and engaging with and seeking feedback from the school community. The pilot has already facilitated increased diversity, with the announcement on 12 January that a Catholic school in Athlone, Cornamaddy National School, will be transferring patronage from its Catholic patron to Longford and Westmeath Education and Training Board.	spk_135
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	School Patronage	dbsect_21	I accept the points the Deputy has made. There are 63 pilots. It is important to remember, as I said previously when it was raised with me, that in some areas it has worked much better and has been a much stronger process than it has been in other areas. There have certainly been challenges and it has been more challenging in some areas than in others. It is for that reason that the Department has given an absolute commitment that there will be a full review of the process. Any learnings that we gain, we will obviously put to good use. It has been particularly complex in the area referenced by the Deputy. Notwithstanding that, I have also pointed to where we have had successes, for example, at Cornamaddy National School. It is the wish and the hope of the Department that there will be number of other transfers of patronage and changes of ethos to multidenominational schools in the short term. The pilots are up and running. We are awaiting the final report from the facilitator in regard to the area that the Deputy references.	spk_137
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	School Patronage	dbsect_21	I cannot be any clearer. From the outset, we have been very clear that the purpose of the pilots is, obviously, that they would be successful in that they would glean for us an increase in multidenominational provision. Equally, however, we have been clear from the outset that there will be learnings from the pilots. A pilot is a pilot. There will be learnings and, obviously, we will put that to good use going forward. However, it is fair to say that the example the Deputy has given, and it was given here earlier this morning, has been particularly complex and particularly challenging. That has not been the experience in other instances. While that does not in any way diminish the challenges that have been presented in this area, notwithstanding that, it is only balanced to say that in other areas those difficulties were not found. Equally, in terms of multidenominational provision, particularly with new schools, it is important to remember that 52 of the 53 new primary schools are multidenominational and 44 of the 50 new post-primary schools are multidenominational. To conclude, there will be a full review of the process on the conclusion of the pilot scheme.	spk_139

Right throughout Covid, our school buildings continued to be built. Last year, a significant number of buildings - 180 new buildings - were provided for. This year, there are 300 projects on hand to be completed by the end of 2023 or early 2024. We have to concede that the Department, like wider society, has been affected by the war in Ukraine, which has impacted the cost of materials. Within the Department of Education, we have provided capacity for more than 15,000 students from Ukraine, which is having its own impact, but with schools positively wanting to do that and graciously doing so. We have also accelerated the delivery of SEN. All of this is important work. We are 100% committed to the delivery of the schools that the Deputy has referenced. There is an issue around capital funding. We are in a positive engagement with the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and his Department on that funding being released as quickly and as soon as possible.	spk_149

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	I have the floor. I am fully committed to these projects going ahead. They are part of a hugely ambitious programme that we have delivered on in the past, including right through Covid, and we are determined to deliver on it this year. We need additional funding to do that and we are in discussion and communication with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, and the Minister on it. I want to acknowledge that they also have demands across a variety of other issues and Departments. They are engaging with us on a positive basis, however, and I am confident that there will be a positive outcome to this. We are seeking to have that outcome in the shortest timeframe possible. The discussions and engagement are ongoing but we are committed to this, and at no stage have we ever said these projects will not continue. These projects will continue and the timing of them will be determined by the availability of funding from the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform.	spk_154

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	The project referred to by the Deputy is at tender stage. The project brief is for the construction of a 600-pupil, two-storey, post-primary school building, including general classrooms, specialist classrooms, assembly hall and all ancillary accommodation. The stage 2b submission for this project was approved in September 2021. Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board and its design team were authorised to proceed to tender upon completion of the pre-qualification process in October 2022. With the original planning permission close to expiring, a decision was made that a new planning application to incorporate additional elements, such as traffic management, was required for the project. This was lodged with Dublin City Council on 26 January 2023. Dublin City Council has since requested that the entire application be recommenced and resubmitted with the additional information. This planning application was resubmitted on 9 March. This project was approved to go to tender in October 2022 but is currently on hold to proceed due to capital funding pressures and the requirement to submit a new planning permission. My Department's published national development plan allocation for 2023 is €860 million. High construction inflation remains a continuing feature of the construction sector for 2023. Given the Department’s strong track record in recent years in delivering the school building programme, and our full utilisation of our budget every year, there is no margin to absorb inflationary pressures. As I have stated, my Department is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform on capital funding pressures to continue to adequately support the operation of the school system with the roll-out of school building projects to construction in 2023. I am appreciative of the support and engagement which has been offered by the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, and by the Minister in this regard. We are currently at an advanced stage with the discussions. Progress has been made and I am anxious to bring this to a resolution quickly. I reassure the Deputy and the relevant school communities that school building projects that are on hold due to capital funding pressures will be progressed and delivered. I am well aware of the urgency in getting these projects delivered as quickly as possible. We will be providing an update to individual schools as soon as possible. In tandem with this, the Department’s planning and building unit will also be updating patron bodies and school management bodies at that stage.	spk_159
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I do not for one minute underestimate the enthusiasm of the school or the good work it does every day with its students and the wider school community. Confirmation of that and of the excellence of the delivery there every day are represented by the determination of the Department to deliver on this project. I have no issue, at an appropriate time, with taking the opportunity to visit the school. As I said, a new planning application has been submitted on the school. I want to be fair also when it comes to the constraints we have on funding but that is part of an ambitious programme of delivery that the Department has across the country. We have been impacted by a variety of different issues, including the war in Ukraine and the cost of materials. We must also make provision for more than 15,000 students from Ukraine and accelerate special educational needs provision. These are all things that everybody wanted us to do. We are in positive discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform and I am confident that those discussions will come to a positive conclusion in as fast a time as possible. I want to confirm again that this project, along with other projects, will proceed. We await the additional funding for same.	spk_161
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I confirm once again that the projects that have been paused will go ahead. We are in constructive engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform. The delays are a consequence of our ambitious programme. More than 300 projects are to be completed this year or in early 2024, in addition to the 180 projects completed last year. Our Department, similar to other Departments, has been challenged by many of the issues that have impacted on wider society including the cost of materials due to the war in Ukraine; as I have already stated, the additional number of students who we absolutely welcome into our schools - more than 15,000 of them are from Ukraine; and the excellent and most important availability of special educational needs, SEN, places, all of which I believe every Member of the House would support. I acknowledge there are capital challenges, but I also acknowledge in the midst of those challenges, we are benefactors of positive engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, notwithstanding the challenges that Department has across a variety of sectors. The engagement is positive. It is going well. It is my intention, hope and expectation that engagement will conclude as quickly as possible. I reiterate the absolute commitment of the Department of Education to each of these projects going ahead.	spk_184
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-23	dail	33	Oideachas trí Ghaeilge	dbsect_25	Tabharfaidh mé an freagra seo idir Bhéarla agus Ghaeilge. Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Ó Snodaigh as ucht aird a tharraingt ar an éileamh atá ar an oideachas lán-Ghaeilge faoi láthair. Mar Aire Oideachais, teastaíonn uaim a chinntiú go ndéanfar soláthar cuí do dhaoine óga ar mian leo oideachas lán-Ghaeilge dara leibhéal a bheith acu. Mar chuid den Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-30, tá mo Roinn tiomanta do dheiseanna a chruthú chun an t-oideachas lán-Ghaeilge a leathnú lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá sé seo ag dul ar aghaidh i gcomhthéacs na bhfógraí maidir le bunú 47 scoil nua ó 2019. Tá sé deimhnithe ag mo Roinn go dtugann an próiseas chun pátrúnacht scoileanna nua a shocrú aird ar leith do bhunú Ghaelscoileanna, Ghaelcholáistí agus aonaid lán-Ghaeilge. In order to plan for school provision and to analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system and data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where pressure for school places will arise. Where demographic data indicate additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances in each case and may be provided through utilising existing unused capacity in a school, extending the capacity of a school or schools or provision of a new school or schools. After it has been decided that a new school is required based on demographic analysis, a patronage process is run. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences and other considerations, such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area, are key to the decision-making process. Such analysis impacts on whether a school at post-primary level would take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelcoláiste or, if it is to be an English-medium school, whether it would include an Irish-medium unit. The year of establishment, patronage, model and language of instruction have yet to be determined for the new post-primary schools that have been announced and will serve the following two school planning areas in the general south Dublin area, namely Dublin 2 and Dublin 4, including Sallynoggin, Killiney and Cherrywood. While it is expected that the existing Gaelcoláistí in the general south Dublin area have sufficient school places between them to accommodate demand in the short term given the number of new Gaelscoileanna which have opened in recent years or are planned to open in the area, the Department is keeping the position under active review as these schools grow and the number of sixth class pupils in Gaelscoileanna increases. The opportunities for expansion of provision at existing Gaelcoláistí such as Coláiste Eoin and Coláiste Íosagáin is also relevant and the Department has written to the school patrons of Coláiste Eoin and Coláiste Íosagáin in this context. The Department is currently developing a new policy for Irish-medium education outside Gaeltacht areas. The policy will be informed by a consultation process. Phase 1 of that process, which involved online work, ran from October 2022 to January 2023. The second phase, which includes focus groups, is currently under way. A review of national and international literature on minority language education provision has also been commissioned along with research on Aonaid in Irish-medium education. This research will also inform the policy development process. Mar a dúirt mé, tá polasaí nua á fhorbairt ag mo Roinn don Ghaelscolaíocht taobh amuigh de na ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá comhairliúchán agus taighde suntasach déanta againn agus beidh an taighde seo go léir mar bhonn eolais cuimsitheach don phróiseas forbartha polasaí.	spk_186

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	Housing Schemes	dbsect_28	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline the current position on the provision of solar panels to schools. I acknowledge Deputy Matthews's personal investment in this and his support for this initiative.It is a priority for the Government to deliver on Ireland's ambitious climate agenda and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes targets around the decarbonisation of Ireland's public buildings. My Department is leading an ambitious sustainability agenda and has progressed a wide array of measures to improve the overall sustainability of our school buildings. The Department of Education is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings, and this performance has been recognised at both national and international levels with sustainable energy awards for excellence in design and specification. The National Development Plan 2021-2030, which was published in October of 2021, provides capital funding of more than €4.4 billion for investment in school infrastructure during the period 2021 to 2025. There continues to be a strong climate action dimension to this additional modernisation programme. Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department's schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 building energy ratings since 2009, with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher energy performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the current building regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging. All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements. Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Department's policy is supported by a strong research programme, with 54 research projects at various stages. This is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI. In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools' needs to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme. My Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme, which is administered by the SEAI and the planning and building unit in the Department of Education, with delivery support from Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies in the educational environment on an evidence-based approach. This programme continues to assist the Department to explore options and to test various solutions for decarbonised energy efficiency solutions in our broad range of school building types. It is paving the way for and informing a much larger schools national programme for the decarbonisation of schools built prior to 2008, as included in the national development plan, and will play a key part of meeting delivery of the climate action plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution-driven delivery strategy that will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools sector. The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 48 schools across Ireland to date, with work on an additional 16 schools currently at various stages. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme. The works typically involve upgrades to the building fabric, including wall and roof insulation, doors and windows, air tightness improvements, LED lighting and heating upgrades as well as renewable technologies. Budget 2023 provided for the provision of funding from the climate action fund in respect of the provision of solar panels in schools up to 6 kW output. This is very positive news for our schools and will assist with their energy needs and costs along with supporting the decarbonisation of our school buildings. My departmental officials are working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the arrangements for this scheme, and details will be announced in the shortest timeframe possible.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	Housing Schemes	dbsect_28	I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position in respect of photovoltaics, PV, provision and to overview some of the ambitious sustainability agenda being progressed to improve the overall sustainability of our school buildings. I sincerely acknowledge the Deputy's personal engagement with me on this issue. I acknowledge it is very close to his heart and I acknowledge the commitment from both my Department and the Department of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to advance this. There has been significant investment to date, as I have outlined, in retrofitting schools, and the Department will continue to support that in conjunction with the SEAI. As highlighted already, the Department has delivered very strong energy efficiency standards in our new school buildings. In respect of solar panels specifically, Department of Education officials are working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the arrangements specific to this scheme, and details will be announced in the shortest timeframe possible. As part of the preparation for the roll-out of the national programme, as I had started to say, a key first step was to establish the level of existing PV installations in our schools. This capacity survey is nearly completed and will inform how we can progress. The provision of the solar panels will be fully funded for schools, which is an important consideration for all our schools, and the roll-out of the solar panel scheme is expected to commence later this year. Equally as important for the benefit of our schools, and the Deputy referred to the manner in which schools will be prioritised, is that this will be a multi-annual programme. There is an absolute commitment from both the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to advance this initiative for the benefit of our schools. It is very much part of climate action, as the Deputy said. There is no one more invested in the whole area of sustainability and climate action than our students themselves. They have been terrific leaders in the area of sustainability and climate action. This will be a welcome addition to our schools and, as I said, we will give the detail of it in the shortest timeframe possible.	spk_462
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	Housing Schemes	dbsect_28	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. It gives me the opportunity to set out to the House the position with regard to primary school places in the Donaghmede-Howth-Dublin 13 school planning area for September 2023 and onwards. As the Deputy may be aware, for school planning purposes, the Department of Education divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses, as the Deputy referenced, a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department’s projections of school place requirements. Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, the Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand. Where data indicate that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstance of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; or provision of a new school or schools. On the basis of such assessment, significant additional primary capacity is already being delivered in the area, including two recently established new primary schools, namely, the Educate Together national school and Gaelscoil Ghráinne Mhaol. A new 16-classroom school building for the Educate Together national school is almost complete and a project to provide a new eight-classroom school for Gaelscoil Ghráinne Mhaol is at stage 1. There are further projects providing additional capacity at Holy Trinity Senior National School and Scoil Cholmcille Senior National School and a recent project at Howth National School provided four new classrooms. The Department is also providing accommodation for children with special educational needs at schools in the area, including at the two new schools, and as part of projects at St. Paul’s Junior National School, St. Kevin’s Junior National School, Scoil Naomh Colmcille and St. Paul’s Senior National School. While the Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in the Dublin 13 area, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors, as previously outlined by the Deputy. There can, in instances, be a duplication of applications where pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools. There is a school-of-choice issue, where pupils cannot get a place in their preferred school, while there are places in other schools in the town or area identified. Some towns or areas have single-sex schools and while places are available in the school, they are not available to all pupils. There is also external draw, that is, pupils coming from outside the local area. The Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues across school planning areas through ongoing discussions with the relevant school patrons and authorities. This close engagement will allow the Department to identify at an early stage particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years that may necessitate further action to that already in train, including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. The Department will continue to keep the short-, medium- and long-term requirements for school places in the Donaghmede-Howth-Dublin 13 school planning area under ongoing review, including through liaison with the local authority in respect of its review of the development and local area plans. I assure the Deputy the Department will continue to work with schools and patrons to ensure there is appropriate provision for all students in the Donaghmede-Howth-Dublin 13 area for the 2023-24 school year and into the future.	spk_464
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	Housing Schemes	dbsect_28	I again thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to outline the position regarding primary school demand in the Donaghmede-Howth-Dublin 13 area. As I outlined, the Department is already providing significant additional primary capacity in the area, on foot of forecasts of school place needs. This includes two recently established new primary schools. While the Department is aware of enrolment pressures in the Donaghmede-Howth-Dublin 13 area for the 2023-24 school year, it is important to note there can be multiple reasons for enrolment pressures, including duplication of applications for admission. The Department will continue to engage with relevant school authorities and patrons to monitor school place needs and to identify any required accommodation solutions, over and above those already in train. In any area where there is an identified deficit of school accommodation for the 2023-24 school year, the Department has a project management service and modular accommodation framework in place that will assist in expediting the delivery of required accommodation solutions. The priority of the Department continues to be to ensure that places are available for every student for the next school year, and will continue to engage with patrons and school authorities in this regard. On the matter of the two specific schools the Deputy raised, I am happy there will be follow-up on that.The reply outlines significant developments in respect of whether it is the Educate Together national school or Gaelscoil Ghráinne Mhaol. The Educate Together national school is located in a 16-classroom school and the eight-classroom addition to Gaelscoil Ghráinne Mhaol is at stage 1. The further projects providing additional capacity include those relating to Holy Trinity National School, Scoil Cholmcille Senior National School. The project at Holy Trinity National School involved the provision of four new classrooms. The Deputy referred specifically to children and young people with special education needs. The Department is also providing accommodation for children with additional needs at schools in the area, including, as already outlined, at the two new schools.	spk_466
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	Housing Schemes	dbsect_28	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. It gives me the opportunity to provide an update on the current position regarding a number of school building projects that are on hold from proceeding to either tender or construction due to capital funding pressures. The Department's capital allocation has always been under significant pressure. The Department has a strong track record of fully utilising that allocation. In many years, it has required supplementary capital funding in order to deliver urgently required school building projects. The pressures on the capital allocation have been compounded since the national development plan, NDP, allocations were determined in 2021 by the impact of high construction inflation, the increasing prevalence of autism and other complex special education needs, which require the accelerated delivery of special educational needs provision at pace, and the urgent need to provide capacity for students from Ukraine and other countries under the international protection system. It is remarkable to note that more than 15,000 students from Ukraine alone have been accommodated in our school system within existing capacity. That obviously will have an impact. The national priority, in the context of the NDP, to increase the roll-out of housing is also adding to pressures on the Department's capital allocation in light of the knock-on impact for additional school provision requirements. The Department's published NDP allocation for 2023 is €860 million. As part of its planning ahead, the Department is in the advanced stages of engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform on capital funding pressures in order to continue to be able to adequately support the operation of the school system with the roll-out of school building projects to tender and construction in 2023, including the projects referred to in media reports. For the information of the Deputy, engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform has been ongoing for a considerable time in respect of additional funding. There were over 180 school building projects delivered during 2022. These projects included accelerated delivery of modular accommodation to support provision for 900 pupils with special education needs. Approximately 300 school building projects continued in construction at the start of 2023, the majority of which will be completed this year or early in 2024. The latter includes more than 40 new school building projects. This is a considerable undertaking. All of these projects are helping to support the operation of our schools, are delivered to the highest standards and are very energy-efficient. This strong level of delivery is a key driver of capital pressures in the Department. Over 70% of the NDP allocation for 2023 is needed to cover expenditure on contractual commitments on approximately 300 existing projects at construction carried forward from 2022. Strategic initiatives put in place to support planning for school provision requirements include the setting up of 16 regional education and language teams to facilitate enrolment of over 15,000 children from Ukraine, which has also been undertaken by the school building unit. Necessary smaller scale refurbishment and maintenance in approximately 1,000 schools has also been undertaken. Some 16 deep energy retrofit pathfinder projects are ongoing in partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Strategic initiatives put in place to support delivery include the use of project manager supports, procurement frameworks, a variety of delivery mechanisms and a strong pipeline of projects. It is also important to note that the Department, with the superb co-operation of schools on the ground, as I have already outlined, has accommodated students not only from Ukraine but also from other parts of the world. These pressures have resulted in the need for my Department's planning and building unit to assess its work programme and priorities for the remainder of 2023 in the context of its available funding. The Department is at the advanced stages of engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform on capital funding pressures in order to continue to adequately support the operation of the school system with roll-out of school building projects to construction, including those in Dublin Mid-West, in 2023. Progress has been made and the Department is anxious to bring this to resolution very quickly. Key priorities in my Department's work programme include continuing strong delivery to support the operation of the school system, with particular regard to planning ahead for the 2023-24 school year and beyond and to supporting special needs provision.	spk_468
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	Housing Schemes	dbsect_28	I am very cognisant of the frustration that exists. Any project being paused is one too many, but we have considerable issues regarding the availability of capital. The Deputy referred very genuinely to the fact that she was a student herself in one of the schools when the new building was first mooted, but I cannot stand over what has happened in the intervening period between when she was a student and is now a Deputy. I do not know what happened in those intervening years. I can comment only on what has happened on my watch in the past two and a half years or so. More than 180 school building projects were delivered in 2022, which included the accelerated delivery of modular accommodation to support the provision of 900 pupils with special educational needs. Approximately 300 school building projects continued into construction at the start of 2023, the majority of which will be completed in 2023 or early 2024, and this includes more than 40 new school buildings. Currently, there is an issue with additional capital being required, largely for the reasons I outlined. We are in a very different circumstance now compared with when the NDP allocation was first made. Various issues have arisen, such as the increased cost of living, events in Ukraine, the additionality of students and so on, but we have continued with the building programme throughout Covid. We are in ongoing engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, and I acknowledge the positive engagement from the Minister at that Department. It is my hope and expectation those engagements and discussions we are having with that Department regarding the availability of funding will come to a conclusion quickly. I am very conscious of the importance of driving on these projects, and we in the Department are fully committed to doing so. Again, I welcome the very positive engagement from the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, and we await the outcome of those engagements.	spk_470
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_29	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline the current position on the provision of solar panels to schools. I acknowledge Deputy Matthews's personal investment in this and his support for this initiative.It is a priority for the Government to deliver on Ireland's ambitious climate agenda and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes targets around the decarbonisation of Ireland's public buildings. My Department is leading an ambitious sustainability agenda and has progressed a wide array of measures to improve the overall sustainability of our school buildings. The Department of Education is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings, and this performance has been recognised at both national and international levels with sustainable energy awards for excellence in design and specification. The National Development Plan 2021-2030, which was published in October of 2021, provides capital funding of more than €4.4 billion for investment in school infrastructure during the period 2021 to 2025. There continues to be a strong climate action dimension to this additional modernisation programme. Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department's schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 building energy ratings since 2009, with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher energy performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the current building regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging. All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements. Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Department's policy is supported by a strong research programme, with 54 research projects at various stages. This is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI. In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools' needs to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme. My Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme, which is administered by the SEAI and the planning and building unit in the Department of Education, with delivery support from Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies in the educational environment on an evidence-based approach. This programme continues to assist the Department to explore options and to test various solutions for decarbonised energy efficiency solutions in our broad range of school building types. It is paving the way for and informing a much larger schools national programme for the decarbonisation of schools built prior to 2008, as included in the national development plan, and will play a key part of meeting delivery of the climate action plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution-driven delivery strategy that will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools sector. The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 48 schools across Ireland to date, with work on an additional 16 schools currently at various stages. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme. The works typically involve upgrades to the building fabric, including wall and roof insulation, doors and windows, air tightness improvements, LED lighting and heating upgrades as well as renewable technologies. Budget 2023 provided for the provision of funding from the climate action fund in respect of the provision of solar panels in schools up to 6 kW output. This is very positive news for our schools and will assist with their energy needs and costs along with supporting the decarbonisation of our school buildings. My departmental officials are working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the arrangements for this scheme, and details will be announced in the shortest timeframe possible.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_29	I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position in respect of photovoltaics, PV, provision and to overview some of the ambitious sustainability agenda being progressed to improve the overall sustainability of our school buildings. I sincerely acknowledge the Deputy's personal engagement with me on this issue. I acknowledge it is very close to his heart and I acknowledge the commitment from both my Department and the Department of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to advance this. There has been significant investment to date, as I have outlined, in retrofitting schools, and the Department will continue to support that in conjunction with the SEAI. As highlighted already, the Department has delivered very strong energy efficiency standards in our new school buildings. In respect of solar panels specifically, Department of Education officials are working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the arrangements specific to this scheme, and details will be announced in the shortest timeframe possible. As part of the preparation for the roll-out of the national programme, as I had started to say, a key first step was to establish the level of existing PV installations in our schools. This capacity survey is nearly completed and will inform how we can progress. The provision of the solar panels will be fully funded for schools, which is an important consideration for all our schools, and the roll-out of the solar panel scheme is expected to commence later this year. Equally as important for the benefit of our schools, and the Deputy referred to the manner in which schools will be prioritised, is that this will be a multi-annual programme. There is an absolute commitment from both the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to advance this initiative for the benefit of our schools. It is very much part of climate action, as the Deputy said. There is no one more invested in the whole area of sustainability and climate action than our students themselves. They have been terrific leaders in the area of sustainability and climate action. This will be a welcome addition to our schools and, as I said, we will give the detail of it in the shortest timeframe possible.	spk_462
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_30	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. It gives me the opportunity to set out to the House the position with regard to primary school places in the Donaghmede-Howth-Dublin 13 school planning area for September 2023 and onwards. As the Deputy may be aware, for school planning purposes, the Department of Education divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses, as the Deputy referenced, a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department’s projections of school place requirements. Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, the Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand. Where data indicate that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstance of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; or provision of a new school or schools. On the basis of such assessment, significant additional primary capacity is already being delivered in the area, including two recently established new primary schools, namely, the Educate Together national school and Gaelscoil Ghráinne Mhaol. A new 16-classroom school building for the Educate Together national school is almost complete and a project to provide a new eight-classroom school for Gaelscoil Ghráinne Mhaol is at stage 1. There are further projects providing additional capacity at Holy Trinity Senior National School and Scoil Cholmcille Senior National School and a recent project at Howth National School provided four new classrooms. The Department is also providing accommodation for children with special educational needs at schools in the area, including at the two new schools, and as part of projects at St. Paul’s Junior National School, St. Kevin’s Junior National School, Scoil Naomh Colmcille and St. Paul’s Senior National School. While the Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in the Dublin 13 area, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors, as previously outlined by the Deputy. There can, in instances, be a duplication of applications where pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools. There is a school-of-choice issue, where pupils cannot get a place in their preferred school, while there are places in other schools in the town or area identified. Some towns or areas have single-sex schools and while places are available in the school, they are not available to all pupils. There is also external draw, that is, pupils coming from outside the local area. The Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues across school planning areas through ongoing discussions with the relevant school patrons and authorities. This close engagement will allow the Department to identify at an early stage particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years that may necessitate further action to that already in train, including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. The Department will continue to keep the short-, medium- and long-term requirements for school places in the Donaghmede-Howth-Dublin 13 school planning area under ongoing review, including through liaison with the local authority in respect of its review of the development and local area plans. I assure the Deputy the Department will continue to work with schools and patrons to ensure there is appropriate provision for all students in the Donaghmede-Howth-Dublin 13 area for the 2023-24 school year and into the future.	spk_464
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_30	I again thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to outline the position regarding primary school demand in the Donaghmede-Howth-Dublin 13 area. As I outlined, the Department is already providing significant additional primary capacity in the area, on foot of forecasts of school place needs. This includes two recently established new primary schools. While the Department is aware of enrolment pressures in the Donaghmede-Howth-Dublin 13 area for the 2023-24 school year, it is important to note there can be multiple reasons for enrolment pressures, including duplication of applications for admission. The Department will continue to engage with relevant school authorities and patrons to monitor school place needs and to identify any required accommodation solutions, over and above those already in train. In any area where there is an identified deficit of school accommodation for the 2023-24 school year, the Department has a project management service and modular accommodation framework in place that will assist in expediting the delivery of required accommodation solutions. The priority of the Department continues to be to ensure that places are available for every student for the next school year, and will continue to engage with patrons and school authorities in this regard. On the matter of the two specific schools the Deputy raised, I am happy there will be follow-up on that.The reply outlines significant developments in respect of whether it is the Educate Together national school or Gaelscoil Ghráinne Mhaol. The Educate Together national school is located in a 16-classroom school and the eight-classroom addition to Gaelscoil Ghráinne Mhaol is at stage 1. The further projects providing additional capacity include those relating to Holy Trinity National School, Scoil Cholmcille Senior National School. The project at Holy Trinity National School involved the provision of four new classrooms. The Deputy referred specifically to children and young people with special education needs. The Department is also providing accommodation for children with additional needs at schools in the area, including, as already outlined, at the two new schools.	spk_466
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_31	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. It gives me the opportunity to provide an update on the current position regarding a number of school building projects that are on hold from proceeding to either tender or construction due to capital funding pressures. The Department's capital allocation has always been under significant pressure. The Department has a strong track record of fully utilising that allocation. In many years, it has required supplementary capital funding in order to deliver urgently required school building projects. The pressures on the capital allocation have been compounded since the national development plan, NDP, allocations were determined in 2021 by the impact of high construction inflation, the increasing prevalence of autism and other complex special education needs, which require the accelerated delivery of special educational needs provision at pace, and the urgent need to provide capacity for students from Ukraine and other countries under the international protection system. It is remarkable to note that more than 15,000 students from Ukraine alone have been accommodated in our school system within existing capacity. That obviously will have an impact. The national priority, in the context of the NDP, to increase the roll-out of housing is also adding to pressures on the Department's capital allocation in light of the knock-on impact for additional school provision requirements. The Department's published NDP allocation for 2023 is €860 million. As part of its planning ahead, the Department is in the advanced stages of engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform on capital funding pressures in order to continue to be able to adequately support the operation of the school system with the roll-out of school building projects to tender and construction in 2023, including the projects referred to in media reports. For the information of the Deputy, engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform has been ongoing for a considerable time in respect of additional funding. There were over 180 school building projects delivered during 2022. These projects included accelerated delivery of modular accommodation to support provision for 900 pupils with special education needs. Approximately 300 school building projects continued in construction at the start of 2023, the majority of which will be completed this year or early in 2024. The latter includes more than 40 new school building projects. This is a considerable undertaking. All of these projects are helping to support the operation of our schools, are delivered to the highest standards and are very energy-efficient. This strong level of delivery is a key driver of capital pressures in the Department. Over 70% of the NDP allocation for 2023 is needed to cover expenditure on contractual commitments on approximately 300 existing projects at construction carried forward from 2022. Strategic initiatives put in place to support planning for school provision requirements include the setting up of 16 regional education and language teams to facilitate enrolment of over 15,000 children from Ukraine, which has also been undertaken by the school building unit. Necessary smaller scale refurbishment and maintenance in approximately 1,000 schools has also been undertaken. Some 16 deep energy retrofit pathfinder projects are ongoing in partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Strategic initiatives put in place to support delivery include the use of project manager supports, procurement frameworks, a variety of delivery mechanisms and a strong pipeline of projects. It is also important to note that the Department, with the superb co-operation of schools on the ground, as I have already outlined, has accommodated students not only from Ukraine but also from other parts of the world. These pressures have resulted in the need for my Department's planning and building unit to assess its work programme and priorities for the remainder of 2023 in the context of its available funding. The Department is at the advanced stages of engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform on capital funding pressures in order to continue to adequately support the operation of the school system with roll-out of school building projects to construction, including those in Dublin Mid-West, in 2023. Progress has been made and the Department is anxious to bring this to resolution very quickly. Key priorities in my Department's work programme include continuing strong delivery to support the operation of the school system, with particular regard to planning ahead for the 2023-24 school year and beyond and to supporting special needs provision.	spk_468
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-03-21	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_31	I am very cognisant of the frustration that exists. Any project being paused is one too many, but we have considerable issues regarding the availability of capital. The Deputy referred very genuinely to the fact that she was a student herself in one of the schools when the new building was first mooted, but I cannot stand over what has happened in the intervening period between when she was a student and is now a Deputy. I do not know what happened in those intervening years. I can comment only on what has happened on my watch in the past two and a half years or so. More than 180 school building projects were delivered in 2022, which included the accelerated delivery of modular accommodation to support the provision of 900 pupils with special educational needs. Approximately 300 school building projects continued into construction at the start of 2023, the majority of which will be completed in 2023 or early 2024, and this includes more than 40 new school buildings. Currently, there is an issue with additional capital being required, largely for the reasons I outlined. We are in a very different circumstance now compared with when the NDP allocation was first made. Various issues have arisen, such as the increased cost of living, events in Ukraine, the additionality of students and so on, but we have continued with the building programme throughout Covid. We are in ongoing engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, and I acknowledge the positive engagement from the Minister at that Department. It is my hope and expectation those engagements and discussions we are having with that Department regarding the availability of funding will come to a conclusion quickly. I am very conscious of the importance of driving on these projects, and we in the Department are fully committed to doing so. Again, I welcome the very positive engagement from the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, and we await the outcome of those engagements.	spk_470
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-16	dail	33	Co-ordination of International Protection Services: Statements	dbsect_32	I thank the House for the opportunity to discuss the very positive response on the part of the education system and school communities to those seeking refuge in Ireland. The very best and most insightful aspect of my job as Minister for Education is the opportunity I am afforded to visit schools across the country. In nearly every school I visit there are students who have recently arrived to Ireland either from Ukraine or through the IPAS system. These are children and young people who are compelled to leave their homes, often leaving family members behind. Too many have witnessed unspeakable tragedies. For these young people, school is now a place of normality where they can achieve some semblance of a routine and, I hope, focus on their well-being, friends and education. This is only made possible as a consequence of the incredible generosity and dedication of principals, teachers, special needs assistants, school secretaries, school caretakers, fellow students, boards of management and broader school and local communities. My Department is determined to continue its support for these huge efforts we are seeing from school communities throughout the country. Members will appreciate the scale of the response when we consider that well over 65,000 people have arrived here from Ukraine alone since the beginning of the war almost a year ago. Figures show that over 14,500 children from Ukraine have now enrolled in schools in every county in the State. To date, approximately 9,000 children from Ukraine have enrolled in primary schools while over 5,000 are in our post-primary schools. Among the Ukrainian children and young people who are here, this represents an enrolment rate of 93%. This is one of the highest such rates among our European peer nations. I have always known, and said, that education relies on a partnership-based approach in which we all work together to provide for our children and young people. For this reason, the Department moved immediately to establish regional education and language teams, REALTs, across the country to co-ordinate school enrolments for Ukrainian families. The remit of the REALTs was subsequently extended to include supporting children who are in the international protection system. I acknowledge the superb work of these teams. Schools that are catering for children fleeing the war in Ukraine and other migrant children are provided with resources to ensure they are supported in their education. Additional teaching resources have been granted to support schools in their work. Additional special educational needs supports and advice, and support and well-being, have also been provided. The issue of appropriate language supports is an important one. The allocation of specialist resources to schools takes account of the needs of pupils in this regard and figures show that nearly 2,000 schools have applied for and are now receiving English as an additional language, EAL, teaching resources. As I said, our schools have done an incredible job. We have had capacity within our schools. We are conscious that capacity is challenging, in some places more than in others. We continue to work with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and his Department to meet any challenges going forward. On the whole, we owe an incredible debt of gratitude to our school communities for the excellent work they do every single day.	spk_322
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	Disabilities Assessments	dbsect_15	The school transport scheme is a significant operation, managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, more than 147,900 children, including more than 18,000 children and young people with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year for more than 3,800 children and young people who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €332.2 million. A review of the school transport scheme has been commenced. The review was conducted with a view to examining the current scheme with regard to its broader effectiveness and sustainability and to ensuring that it serves students and their families. Significant consultation has been undertaken as part of this review. A public survey was administered for parents, guardians and students who use the service and, equally as important, for those who do not use the service but wish to have access to it. A broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments were consulted as part of the review. Phase 1 of the review is complete. It examined the impact of eligibility criteria on mainstream pupils who were eligible for transport to their nearest school but were attending their next nearest school. Following consideration of this report for the 2021-22 school year, the provision of temporary alleviation measures was approved for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport, but were attending their second-nearest school and had applied and paid on time. These measures have been continued for the 2022-23 school year, pending completion of the review. They mean transport is provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second-nearest school; applied for school transport by 29 April 2022 and registered for a ticket by 29 July 2022. Phase 2 of the review has progressed significantly and is being completed in tandem with phase 3, which has commenced. While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the current conflict in Ukraine, and by the increased demand for the scheme in summer 2022 due to the waiving of fees, my officials are working to complete phase 3 of the review within the coming weeks with recommendations on the future operation of the scheme. Once approved by Government, it is planned that the review will be published. Planning for the operation of the scheme for the 2023-24 year is expected to be completed shortly-----	spk_150
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	Disabilities Assessments	dbsect_15	The Deputy is correct. Some 147,900 young people benefit from the scheme. He is also right that the review is a considerable body of work. Phase 1 has been completed. The consultation alone involved consulting with thousands of parents. It also involved consultation with stakeholders, providers in the area and with best practice with regard to what is happening in other European countries. A phenomenal body of work has been completed. Phase 2 is also complete and phase 3 has begun. It is our expectation that it will be completed in the coming weeks. The Deputy will be aware that we introduced a temporary alleviation measure as part of the process. We did so not just for 2021 and 2022, but continued it into 2022 and 2023. A considerable body of work has been undertaken. I will accept it was possibly impacted by what is happening in Ukraine with regard to making additional services available, but our expectation is that the work will be completed in the coming weeks.	spk_153
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	Disabilities Assessments	dbsect_15	I appreciate the Deputy's points. As a consequence of what was introduced last year, we have seen a 25% increase in provision of places for students on the school bus system, that is, 25,600 places and there has been a 26% increase in the allocation of special education places. There has been a considerable increase in availability of places in the school transport system. I take the Deputy's point about tickets being allocated, but they were allocated to people who fulfilled the criteria. He will be aware that the criteria are based on whether the students at primary level were 3.2 km from their school or students at post-primary level were 4.8 km from their nearest or next-nearest school. Distance from the schools and paying on time were the criteria. Seats are empty for a variety of reasons. Schools may open or close at different times. Thus, there will be additional capacity at a given time. Parents, on a given day, might make themselves available to take a child to school. I cannot interfere with that process. I appreciate what the Deputy said about the application process and its being difficult. That is all part of the review process. It is our expectation the review process will be completed in the coming weeks.	spk_155
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	Disabilities Assessments	dbsect_15	My Department’s statement of strategy sets out the vision and mission of the Department for an educational system where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential. Its goal is to ensure equity of opportunity in education and that all pupils are supported to fulfil their potential. Since June 2020, and over the past three budgets, I have secured funding to support measures aimed at achieving and sustaining that goal. As part of budget 2023, I announced a €50 million provision to provide free books to primary school pupils within the free education scheme from next September. This is a significant investment and further reflects the Government’s commitment to a quality and inclusive school system with improved learning outcomes for every pupil. The Government recognises that the cost of preparing children for school each September can be a cause of financial difficulty and worry for many Irish families. This free schoolbooks measure will eliminate the cost to these families for all school books at primary school, including workbooks. It delivers on the programme for Government commitment to extend the free school book pilot which is currently in place in a number of DEIS primary schools. The free primary school books scheme will benefit up to 540,000 pupils in approximately 3,240 recognised primary schools, including over 130 special schools. The implementation of the measure will build on the existing school book rental scheme which is available in some 96% of recognised primary schools and has been in place for many years. Schools buy books directly from school book suppliers at present as part of the implementation of the existing school book rental scheme. My Department will also consider the information and experience from the schools involved in the free school book pilot for the past three years.  My Department has been engaging with relevant stakeholders including teacher unions, management bodies and representatives of school book publishers and booksellers in order to inform and plan for the roll out of the measure. Engagement has already commenced and I will meet with all stakeholders imminently.  Detailed guidance for primary schools on the operation of the free schoolbooks measure is being developed and, together with the funding, will be provided to schools to support the purchase of the books and resources in time for the start of the 2023-24 school year. It is recognised that this work will have to commence in schools after the Easter break.	spk_157
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	Disabilities Assessments	dbsect_15	I appreciate the Deputy's support and want to acknowledge that there has been almost unanimous support within the Chamber for this measure. He is correct and I am conscious that the information needs to be in schools soon so that they have the opportunity to do what needs to be done in terms of the scheme. I recognise that schools will need to have this information available to them after the Easter break and we are working towards that schedule. As I have outlined to the Deputy, it is important that proper consultation takes place. We have had consultation with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, the Irish Educational Publishers Association and Booksellers Ireland. The Deputy also referenced post-primary schools. Initially, this is a primary-led initiative and there will be great learning from it. It is my hope and expectation that we will have an opportunity, going forward, to extend it to the post-primary sector. I also want to acknowledge that the package provided to schools will be based on the learnings that we had from the book rental scheme and the free book pilot scheme that we ran across 102 DEIS primary schools. This provides a significant learning opportunity, combined with what we will learn from the publishers.	spk_159
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	Disabilities Assessments	dbsect_15	Schools will have the autonomy to purchase the books from their nearest and local provider, or whomever they have an existing relationship with. I am conscious that many schools have strong relationships with their local bookshop or local book provider and that autonomy will continue. The schools will make the decision as to where they will source the books. The funding that is being provided is specifically for the provision of textbooks and workbooks. Schools make their own policy around whether they use e-books or textbooks but the funding will be made available on the basis of the provision of appropriate textbooks and workbooks. Schools will continue to have autonomy to decide with whom they will do business in the provision of those books. If they have an existing relationship with a local provider, they will have the freedom to make a decision to continue that relationship with that local provider.	spk_161
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	Disabilities Assessments	dbsect_15	I acknowledge the Deputy's engagement on, and interest in, this particular project. I am pleased to advise that the project on a greenfield site was approved for delivery by my Department for the school in question. The project provides for four mainstream classrooms and one special education needs, SEN, base under the Department's timber modular framework. The site was transferred from Solas to the Minister for Education at nil cost, in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circulars regarding the transfer and disposal of State assets. The project has been devolved for delivery to Laois Offaly Education and Training Board, LOETB. Under my Department’s service level agreement with LOETB, the ETB has responsibility for communicating progress on the project to the school authorities concerned. A design team was appointed to guide the project through the stages of architectural planning and tendering, with the ultimate goal of proceeding to construction in a timely manner.  The project will employ my Department’s timber modular framework, which is manufactured to comply with the Department’s technical guidance documents. These are available on the Department’s website. The project will achieve a low embodied carbon footprint that will meet or exceed 2030 targets contained within Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland, RIAI, 2030 climate challenge target metrics for new-build schools published in October 2021. My Department's professional and technical officers are working closely with design teams on this project and others employing this innovative technology.  My Department has a strong track record of delivery of school building projects and this was achieved again in 2022, notwithstanding the wider construction sector environment of high inflation, labour shortages and supply chain issues. This is evidenced by the fact that there are currently 300 school building projects at construction stage and a further 1,000 at pre-construction stage, including the project referred to by the Deputy. The Department will continue to review its ongoing enrolment requirements for 2023 and the associated work programme.  The particular project raised by her is currently at planning application stage with a final decision to be made in late February. The Department is currently examining needs for the 2023-24 school year as part of its overall assessment of our work programme.	spk_163

I acknowledge the importance of the project and I accept that the school awaits it in anticipation but there is a clear line of progress that needs to be followed, particularly in the area of planning. I acknowledge the work of the ETB in this regard, given that the project has devolved to it. We will move the project with the priority that can be afforded to it, giving consideration to the various hurdles it has to jump. I acknowledge the Deputy's personal interest in this, along with Deputies Fleming, Cowen and Flanagan and everybody else who has come to me in respect of it.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_17	The school transport scheme is a significant operation, managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, more than 147,900 children, including more than 18,000 children and young people with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year for more than 3,800 children and young people who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €332.2 million. A review of the school transport scheme has been commenced. The review was conducted with a view to examining the current scheme with regard to its broader effectiveness and sustainability and to ensuring that it serves students and their families. Significant consultation has been undertaken as part of this review. A public survey was administered for parents, guardians and students who use the service and, equally as important, for those who do not use the service but wish to have access to it. A broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments were consulted as part of the review. Phase 1 of the review is complete. It examined the impact of eligibility criteria on mainstream pupils who were eligible for transport to their nearest school but were attending their next nearest school. Following consideration of this report for the 2021-22 school year, the provision of temporary alleviation measures was approved for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport, but were attending their second-nearest school and had applied and paid on time. These measures have been continued for the 2022-23 school year, pending completion of the review. They mean transport is provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second-nearest school; applied for school transport by 29 April 2022 and registered for a ticket by 29 July 2022. Phase 2 of the review has progressed significantly and is being completed in tandem with phase 3, which has commenced. While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the current conflict in Ukraine, and by the increased demand for the scheme in summer 2022 due to the waiving of fees, my officials are working to complete phase 3 of the review within the coming weeks with recommendations on the future operation of the scheme. Once approved by Government, it is planned that the review will be published. Planning for the operation of the scheme for the 2023-24 year is expected to be completed shortly-----	spk_150
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_17	The Deputy is correct. Some 147,900 young people benefit from the scheme. He is also right that the review is a considerable body of work. Phase 1 has been completed. The consultation alone involved consulting with thousands of parents. It also involved consultation with stakeholders, providers in the area and with best practice with regard to what is happening in other European countries. A phenomenal body of work has been completed. Phase 2 is also complete and phase 3 has begun. It is our expectation that it will be completed in the coming weeks. The Deputy will be aware that we introduced a temporary alleviation measure as part of the process. We did so not just for 2021 and 2022, but continued it into 2022 and 2023. A considerable body of work has been undertaken. I will accept it was possibly impacted by what is happening in Ukraine with regard to making additional services available, but our expectation is that the work will be completed in the coming weeks.	spk_153
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_17	I appreciate the Deputy's points. As a consequence of what was introduced last year, we have seen a 25% increase in provision of places for students on the school bus system, that is, 25,600 places and there has been a 26% increase in the allocation of special education places. There has been a considerable increase in availability of places in the school transport system. I take the Deputy's point about tickets being allocated, but they were allocated to people who fulfilled the criteria. He will be aware that the criteria are based on whether the students at primary level were 3.2 km from their school or students at post-primary level were 4.8 km from their nearest or next-nearest school. Distance from the schools and paying on time were the criteria. Seats are empty for a variety of reasons. Schools may open or close at different times. Thus, there will be additional capacity at a given time. Parents, on a given day, might make themselves available to take a child to school. I cannot interfere with that process. I appreciate what the Deputy said about the application process and its being difficult. That is all part of the review process. It is our expectation the review process will be completed in the coming weeks.	spk_155
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Textbooks	dbsect_18	My Department’s statement of strategy sets out the vision and mission of the Department for an educational system where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential. Its goal is to ensure equity of opportunity in education and that all pupils are supported to fulfil their potential. Since June 2020, and over the past three budgets, I have secured funding to support measures aimed at achieving and sustaining that goal. As part of budget 2023, I announced a €50 million provision to provide free books to primary school pupils within the free education scheme from next September. This is a significant investment and further reflects the Government’s commitment to a quality and inclusive school system with improved learning outcomes for every pupil. The Government recognises that the cost of preparing children for school each September can be a cause of financial difficulty and worry for many Irish families. This free schoolbooks measure will eliminate the cost to these families for all school books at primary school, including workbooks. It delivers on the programme for Government commitment to extend the free school book pilot which is currently in place in a number of DEIS primary schools. The free primary school books scheme will benefit up to 540,000 pupils in approximately 3,240 recognised primary schools, including over 130 special schools. The implementation of the measure will build on the existing school book rental scheme which is available in some 96% of recognised primary schools and has been in place for many years. Schools buy books directly from school book suppliers at present as part of the implementation of the existing school book rental scheme. My Department will also consider the information and experience from the schools involved in the free school book pilot for the past three years.  My Department has been engaging with relevant stakeholders including teacher unions, management bodies and representatives of school book publishers and booksellers in order to inform and plan for the roll out of the measure. Engagement has already commenced and I will meet with all stakeholders imminently.  Detailed guidance for primary schools on the operation of the free schoolbooks measure is being developed and, together with the funding, will be provided to schools to support the purchase of the books and resources in time for the start of the 2023-24 school year. It is recognised that this work will have to commence in schools after the Easter break.	spk_157
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Textbooks	dbsect_18	I appreciate the Deputy's support and want to acknowledge that there has been almost unanimous support within the Chamber for this measure. He is correct and I am conscious that the information needs to be in schools soon so that they have the opportunity to do what needs to be done in terms of the scheme. I recognise that schools will need to have this information available to them after the Easter break and we are working towards that schedule. As I have outlined to the Deputy, it is important that proper consultation takes place. We have had consultation with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, the Irish Educational Publishers Association and Booksellers Ireland. The Deputy also referenced post-primary schools. Initially, this is a primary-led initiative and there will be great learning from it. It is my hope and expectation that we will have an opportunity, going forward, to extend it to the post-primary sector. I also want to acknowledge that the package provided to schools will be based on the learnings that we had from the book rental scheme and the free book pilot scheme that we ran across 102 DEIS primary schools. This provides a significant learning opportunity, combined with what we will learn from the publishers.	spk_159
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Textbooks	dbsect_18	Schools will have the autonomy to purchase the books from their nearest and local provider, or whomever they have an existing relationship with. I am conscious that many schools have strong relationships with their local bookshop or local book provider and that autonomy will continue. The schools will make the decision as to where they will source the books. The funding that is being provided is specifically for the provision of textbooks and workbooks. Schools make their own policy around whether they use e-books or textbooks but the funding will be made available on the basis of the provision of appropriate textbooks and workbooks. Schools will continue to have autonomy to decide with whom they will do business in the provision of those books. If they have an existing relationship with a local provider, they will have the freedom to make a decision to continue that relationship with that local provider.	spk_161
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_19	I acknowledge the Deputy's engagement on, and interest in, this particular project. I am pleased to advise that the project on a greenfield site was approved for delivery by my Department for the school in question. The project provides for four mainstream classrooms and one special education needs, SEN, base under the Department's timber modular framework. The site was transferred from Solas to the Minister for Education at nil cost, in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circulars regarding the transfer and disposal of State assets. The project has been devolved for delivery to Laois Offaly Education and Training Board, LOETB. Under my Department’s service level agreement with LOETB, the ETB has responsibility for communicating progress on the project to the school authorities concerned. A design team was appointed to guide the project through the stages of architectural planning and tendering, with the ultimate goal of proceeding to construction in a timely manner.  The project will employ my Department’s timber modular framework, which is manufactured to comply with the Department’s technical guidance documents. These are available on the Department’s website. The project will achieve a low embodied carbon footprint that will meet or exceed 2030 targets contained within Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland, RIAI, 2030 climate challenge target metrics for new-build schools published in October 2021. My Department's professional and technical officers are working closely with design teams on this project and others employing this innovative technology.  My Department has a strong track record of delivery of school building projects and this was achieved again in 2022, notwithstanding the wider construction sector environment of high inflation, labour shortages and supply chain issues. This is evidenced by the fact that there are currently 300 school building projects at construction stage and a further 1,000 at pre-construction stage, including the project referred to by the Deputy. The Department will continue to review its ongoing enrolment requirements for 2023 and the associated work programme.  The particular project raised by her is currently at planning application stage with a final decision to be made in late February. The Department is currently examining needs for the 2023-24 school year as part of its overall assessment of our work programme.	spk_163

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_22	As the Deputy will be aware, for school planning purposes the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and utilises a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data and school enrolment data, in addition to information on residential development activity, is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements. As part of the Department's commitment to the national planning framework, as part of Project Ireland 2040, and with the objective of ensuring appropriate educational provision for future populations, my Department engages proactively with the 31 local authorities in the development of their statutory plans. In the context of Limerick city, my Department has had regular engagement with Limerick City and County Council through the development and adoption of its development plan for the period 2022 to 2028. This has allowed my Department to plan for projected population growth of 30,000 people in Limerick city over the course of the development plan and in the context of projected overall population growth of over 50,000 in the city by 2040. However, it is important to note that the impact of population growth on school place requirements is mitigated by changing demographic trends. Despite projected national population growth, the number of primary students is forecast to reduce by 100,000 over the next decade. While post-primary enrolments are expected to peak in 2024, they are forecast to decline by 70,000 over the subsequent ten years. The impact on school places of the projected population growth in Limerick city is being considered in that context, with a view to identifying any further accommodation solutions required to meet the capacity requirements. However, as I know the Deputy is aware, it is important to note that my Department is already delivering significant additional capacity at schools in the city as part of its capital programme. Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately €4.4 billion in capital investment over the period 2021 to 2025. There will be a rolling five-year funding envelope, which will be updated annually for the period 2026 to 2030 within the Government's overall national development plan funding envelope of €136 billion in Exchequer capital – €165 billion total capital including non-Exchequer capital. This will facilitate the building of modern and sustainable school infrastructure.	spk_176
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_22	The Deputy's initial point was on the provision of places for pupils in Limerick. Specifically on that issue, recently over 100 additional places have been provided in Limerick, 44 of which have been provided in recent weeks. There is a school in a position to make provision for the 26 pupils the Deputy referred to. Principals on the ground, particularly the chair of the Limerick Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, have confirmed they are confident the 26 pupils will be provided for in existing accommodation. Specifically on the commitment to Limerick city, I want to take the opportunity to outline significant developments there. These include two newly established 1,000-pupil post-primary schools, namely Mungret Community College and Limerick Educate Together Secondary School, both of which are currently in construction. New school buildings providing additional capacity are planned for Laurel Hill Secondary School, Laurel Hill Coláiste FCJ, Ardscoil Mhuire and Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, while there are extensions planned at Coláiste Mhichíl and Castletroy College. There is significant work ongoing.	spk_178
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_22	I do not have an issue with that. I appreciate the Deputy's graciousness in accepting that there has been considerable investment in Limerick city. I have had the privilege of witnessing much of the work. I visited on several occasions. I referred to post-primary schools but developments at primary level are equally important. At primary level, a project for a new 32-classroom school building for Monaleen National School is planned. Gaelscoil Sheoirse and St. Mary's National School both have major refurbishment projects under way. Projects for new school buildings for both Red Hill School and St. Vincent's Special School are also in train. In total, there are 32 schools building projects in Limerick at various stages of planning and delivery. That represents a significant investment and testament to the Department's confidence in what is happening in Limerick city and county.The Department will continue to work to advance planned and current projects in Limerick city. I acknowledge the holistic view the Department takes with regard to location and meeting demographic needs. We will continue to do that.	spk_180
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_22	"I acknowledge the Deputy's particular interest in the DEIS scheme. The Department provides a wide range of supports to all schools, including DEIS schools and non-DEIS schools, to support the inclusion of all students and to address barriers to students achieving their potential. Supplementing the universal supports available to all schools, the DEIS programme is a key policy initiative of the Department to address concentrated - the word ""concentrated"" is key - educational disadvantage at school level in a targeted and equitable way across the primary and post-primary sector. As the Deputy has referenced, in March last year, I announced a major expansion of the DEIS programme. The programme was significantly expanded for the first time since 2017 and now covers an additional 322 schools. The programme now includes over 1,200 schools and supports approximately 240,000 students. This means one in every four of our students now benefits from DEIS programme supports. This recent expansion will add an additional €32 million to my Department’s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the overall Department of Education allocation for the programme to €180 million. I am very conscious of the benefits of the DEIS programme. Analysis has shown that, since the programme began in 2006, it has helped to close the gap in achievement between schools serving populations experiencing the highest levels of educational disadvantage and those serving populations with little or no disadvantage. It has provided children who come to education at a disadvantage with an equitable opportunity to achieve their potential in education. The extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one component of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Since June 2020 and over the past three budgets, I have secured funding to provide measures to support children in this regard. As part of budget 2023, as we referenced earlier, I announced over €50 million to provide schoolbooks and I reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to its lowest ever level, 23:1. This is a consequence of a reduction in each of the budgets I have presided over."	spk_182
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_22	I will be clear. As I said, the key issue here is concentrated levels of disadvantage. I fully accept that there will always be children at risk of educational disadvantage in any school. I appreciate that. The specific supports that come with DEIS status are provided where there are concentrated levels of disadvantage. I accept the point the Deputy has raised about one school in a community receiving such status while another does not but, unless the exact same students with the exact same backgrounds attend both schools, there will not be the same level of concentration. That is the point. I am not for one minute suggesting that there are not students at risk of educational disadvantage in both of the schools in the area the Deputy referred to but it is the level of concentration that determines whether a school receives DEIS status. Following the national census in 2022, which was held on 3 April last, it is envisaged that an updated Haase-Pratschke, HP, deprivation index will be generated by Pobal. That will be available in the third quarter of 2023. The Department will engage with Pobal in respect of this process. The updated HP deprivation index will inform the variety of different layers of support we may be able to offer schools.	spk_184
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_22	I will first complete my answer on the question of educational disadvantage. I am very conscious of the need to ensure supports across all schools because there are children at risk of educational disadvantage across all schools. It is for this reason that, as I stated earlier, we have introduced a variety of different measures, including measures with regard to the pupil-teacher ratio, a free books scheme at a cost of more than €50 million, a pilot programme of counselling services in our primary schools and so on. As a consequence of the new HP index being formulated, the next phase of work will begin within my Department. We will look at a variety of types of supports that can be rolled out to schools to meet their needs. These may not necessarily involve DEIS status. There will be a kind of stepped system. There will be DEIS status, another step and then the next. On the specific point the Deputy raised regarding special education, he will be aware of the role of the special educational needs organiser, SENO. Considerable additional resources have been made available to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to boost its work and the availability of SENOs to communicate with parents on the ground to obtain the fullest picture possible of the needs of the student, which the SENOs then filter back to the NCSE.	spk_186
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_22	As the Deputy is aware, the school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, more than 147,900 children, including over 18,000 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year to just over 3,800 children and young people who have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €332.2 million. A review of the school transport scheme commenced in 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and its sustainability, and to ensure it serves students and their families adequately. Significant consultation has been undertaken as part of this review. A public survey was administered for parents, guardians and students who use the service and, perhaps more importantly, those who do not use the service but would like to be in a position to access it. A broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments were all consulted as part of this review. Phase 1 of the review examined the impact of the eligibility criteria on mainstream pupils who were eligible for transport to their nearest school but attending their next-nearest school. The report was completed in June 2021. Following consideration of this report, the provision of temporary alleviation measures for transport for the 2021-22 school year was approved for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport, but were attending their second-nearest school and had applied and paid on time. These measures have continued and are provided for in the 2022-23 school year, pending completion of the review. These measures mean that transport is provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second-nearest school, and who applied for school transport and paid on time. Phase 2 of the review has progressed significantly and is being completed in tandem with phase 3 which has also begun. While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the current conflict in Ukraine and by the increased demand for the scheme in summer 2022, officials are working to complete phase 3 of the review within the coming weeks, with recommendations on the future operation of the Department’s school transport scheme then being made.

Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_22	While this review has been up and running we have, in the interim, introduced some measures. The Deputy specifically referenced the issue of the next-nearest school at post-primary level. That temporary alleviation measure was introduced for the 2021-22 school year and continued for 2022-23. There is a criterion for eligibility, namely, that students have to live within 3.2 km of their primary school and be attending the nearest school. At post-primary level, the distance is 4.8 km and students must be attending their nearest or next-nearest school. I am conscious of the issue around Kilnaleck the Deputy raised. As she said, school preference there is historical. I acknowledge that this has also been raised with me very specifically. Indeed, Deputy Niamh Smyth tabled a question in respect of it and it has also been raised by other Deputies in the constituency. To be very clear, eligibility criteria are very much part of the review process. We are looking at eligibility in respect of distance, nearest school, next-nearest school and so on.	spk_212
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_22	On the specific points raised regarding increased capacity, I will be very clear that there has been a 25% increase in capacity this year, which is a phenomenal increase. More than 25,600 additional places have been provided this year as a consequence of the scheme. That includes a 26% increase in provision for those with special educational needs. Everything is being looked at as part of the review, including costs, distance and all the other criteria. We are working as efficiently as possible in the Department to ensure we are in a position to have the review completed within the coming weeks, which is my expectation. It is an enormous body of work. I acknowledge the significant co-operation we have received from all stakeholders, including parents, guardians, students, the wider community, and the stakeholders and providers within the system. We are working assiduously to ensure the review will be completed in the coming weeks. When completed, it will be presented to the Government and there will be a requirement to engage with other Departments regarding our ability to progress matters.

Principals on the ground, particularly the chair of the Limerick Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, have confirmed they are confident the 26 pupils will be provided for in existing accommodation. Specifically on the commitment to Limerick city, I want to take the opportunity to outline significant developments there. These include two newly established 1,000-pupil post-primary schools, namely Mungret Community College and Limerick Educate Together Secondary School, both of which are currently in construction. New school buildings providing additional capacity are planned for Laurel Hill Secondary School, Laurel Hill Coláiste FCJ, Ardscoil Mhuire and Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, while there are extensions planned at Coláiste Mhichíl and Castletroy College. There is significant work ongoing.	spk_178
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_23	I do not have an issue with that. I appreciate the Deputy's graciousness in accepting that there has been considerable investment in Limerick city. I have had the privilege of witnessing much of the work. I visited on several occasions. I referred to post-primary schools but developments at primary level are equally important. At primary level, a project for a new 32-classroom school building for Monaleen National School is planned. Gaelscoil Sheoirse and St. Mary's National School both have major refurbishment projects under way. Projects for new school buildings for both Red Hill School and St. Vincent's Special School are also in train. In total, there are 32 schools building projects in Limerick at various stages of planning and delivery. That represents a significant investment and testament to the Department's confidence in what is happening in Limerick city and county.The Department will continue to work to advance planned and current projects in Limerick city. I acknowledge the holistic view the Department takes with regard to location and meeting demographic needs. We will continue to do that.	spk_180
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_24	"I acknowledge the Deputy's particular interest in the DEIS scheme. The Department provides a wide range of supports to all schools, including DEIS schools and non-DEIS schools, to support the inclusion of all students and to address barriers to students achieving their potential. Supplementing the universal supports available to all schools, the DEIS programme is a key policy initiative of the Department to address concentrated - the word ""concentrated"" is key - educational disadvantage at school level in a targeted and equitable way across the primary and post-primary sector. As the Deputy has referenced, in March last year, I announced a major expansion of the DEIS programme. The programme was significantly expanded for the first time since 2017 and now covers an additional 322 schools. The programme now includes over 1,200 schools and supports approximately 240,000 students. This means one in every four of our students now benefits from DEIS programme supports. This recent expansion will add an additional €32 million to my Department’s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the overall Department of Education allocation for the programme to €180 million. I am very conscious of the benefits of the DEIS programme. Analysis has shown that, since the programme began in 2006, it has helped to close the gap in achievement between schools serving populations experiencing the highest levels of educational disadvantage and those serving populations with little or no disadvantage. It has provided children who come to education at a disadvantage with an equitable opportunity to achieve their potential in education. The extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one component of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Since June 2020 and over the past three budgets, I have secured funding to provide measures to support children in this regard. As part of budget 2023, as we referenced earlier, I announced over €50 million to provide schoolbooks and I reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to its lowest ever level, 23:1. This is a consequence of a reduction in each of the budgets I have presided over."	spk_182
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_24	I will be clear. As I said, the key issue here is concentrated levels of disadvantage. I fully accept that there will always be children at risk of educational disadvantage in any school. I appreciate that. The specific supports that come with DEIS status are provided where there are concentrated levels of disadvantage. I accept the point the Deputy has raised about one school in a community receiving such status while another does not but, unless the exact same students with the exact same backgrounds attend both schools, there will not be the same level of concentration. That is the point. I am not for one minute suggesting that there are not students at risk of educational disadvantage in both of the schools in the area the Deputy referred to but it is the level of concentration that determines whether a school receives DEIS status. Following the national census in 2022, which was held on 3 April last, it is envisaged that an updated Haase-Pratschke, HP, deprivation index will be generated by Pobal. That will be available in the third quarter of 2023. The Department will engage with Pobal in respect of this process. The updated HP deprivation index will inform the variety of different layers of support we may be able to offer schools.	spk_184
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_24	I will first complete my answer on the question of educational disadvantage. I am very conscious of the need to ensure supports across all schools because there are children at risk of educational disadvantage across all schools. It is for this reason that, as I stated earlier, we have introduced a variety of different measures, including measures with regard to the pupil-teacher ratio, a free books scheme at a cost of more than €50 million, a pilot programme of counselling services in our primary schools and so on. As a consequence of the new HP index being formulated, the next phase of work will begin within my Department. We will look at a variety of types of supports that can be rolled out to schools to meet their needs. These may not necessarily involve DEIS status. There will be a kind of stepped system. There will be DEIS status, another step and then the next. On the specific point the Deputy raised regarding special education, he will be aware of the role of the special educational needs organiser, SENO. Considerable additional resources have been made available to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to boost its work and the availability of SENOs to communicate with parents on the ground to obtain the fullest picture possible of the needs of the student, which the SENOs then filter back to the NCSE.	spk_186
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_28	As the Deputy is aware, the school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, more than 147,900 children, including over 18,000 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year to just over 3,800 children and young people who have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €332.2 million. A review of the school transport scheme commenced in 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and its sustainability, and to ensure it serves students and their families adequately. Significant consultation has been undertaken as part of this review. A public survey was administered for parents, guardians and students who use the service and, perhaps more importantly, those who do not use the service but would like to be in a position to access it. A broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments were all consulted as part of this review. Phase 1 of the review examined the impact of the eligibility criteria on mainstream pupils who were eligible for transport to their nearest school but attending their next-nearest school. The report was completed in June 2021. Following consideration of this report, the provision of temporary alleviation measures for transport for the 2021-22 school year was approved for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport, but were attending their second-nearest school and had applied and paid on time. These measures have continued and are provided for in the 2022-23 school year, pending completion of the review. These measures mean that transport is provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second-nearest school, and who applied for school transport and paid on time. Phase 2 of the review has progressed significantly and is being completed in tandem with phase 3 which has also begun. While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the current conflict in Ukraine and by the increased demand for the scheme in summer 2022, officials are working to complete phase 3 of the review within the coming weeks, with recommendations on the future operation of the Department’s school transport scheme then being made. Once approved by the Government, it is planned that the review will be published.	spk_210
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_28	While this review has been up and running we have, in the interim, introduced some measures. The Deputy specifically referenced the issue of the next-nearest school at post-primary level. That temporary alleviation measure was introduced for the 2021-22 school year and continued for 2022-23. There is a criterion for eligibility, namely, that students have to live within 3.2 km of their primary school and be attending the nearest school. At post-primary level, the distance is 4.8 km and students must be attending their nearest or next-nearest school. I am conscious of the issue around Kilnaleck the Deputy raised. As she said, school preference there is historical. I acknowledge that this has also been raised with me very specifically. Indeed, Deputy Niamh Smyth tabled a question in respect of it and it has also been raised by other Deputies in the constituency. To be very clear, eligibility criteria are very much part of the review process. We are looking at eligibility in respect of distance, nearest school, next-nearest school and so on.	spk_212
Norma Foley	51	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2023-02-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_28	On the specific points raised regarding increased capacity, I will be very clear that there has been a 25% increase in capacity this year, which is a phenomenal increase. More than 25,600 additional places have been provided this year as a consequence of the scheme. That includes a 26% increase in provision for those with special educational needs. Everything is being looked at as part of the review, including costs, distance and all the other criteria. We are working as efficiently as possible in the Department to ensure we are in a position to have the review completed within the coming weeks, which is my expectation. It is an enormous body of work. I acknowledge the significant co-operation we have received from all stakeholders, including parents, guardians, students, the wider community, and the stakeholders and providers within the system. We are working assiduously to ensure the review will be completed in the coming weeks. When completed, it will be presented to the Government and there will be a requirement to engage with other Departments regarding our ability to progress matters. Once the review has been presented to the Government, it will be published.	spk_215

Tá an-chuid oibre déanta go dtí an pointe seo agus táim buíoch den Teachta as an seans é sin a chur os comhair an Teach seo. I thank the Deputy and I want to acknowledge his personal engagement and interest in this, and I am fully cognisant of the importance of the body of work ongoing in relation to this. I want to say very clearly at the outset that the views of survivors of institutional abuse must be, and are, central when considering future supports and services to meet their needs. For that reason, as the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Education has been engaged in a structured process of consultation with survivors and survivor groups over a number of years, as he has outlined. This process began with the engagement by the Department of professionally qualified facilitators to undertake a series of consultations with survivors on the themes and issues of most specific concern to them. The facilitators engaged with more than 100 people and held more than 30 meetings. These meetings enabled survivors to reflect on their experiences, the State's response to the issue of institutional abuse and to make any recommendations they might wish to make. This phase of the process resulted in the submission to the Department of Education of a report entitled Consultations with Survivors of Institutional Abuse and Themes and Issues to be Addressed by a Survivor Led Consultation Group. The report identified a number of priority issues for survivors, including the health needs of an aging population and the need to make services easier to access. Phase 2 of the process involved the establishment of a survivor-led consultative forum to further consider the themes and issues identified. This was again supported by facilitators who were engaged by the Department of Education. A method the Deputy outlined was for the forum to personally engage with survivors in Ireland, and indeed in the United Kingdom, and to hear directly from them. Officials from my Department have also met with the forum on a number of occasions to discuss its work. I would like to acknowledge the commitment and insight of the survivors who have participated in the consultation process, as well as the support and significant expertise provided by the facilitators involved in the process. The final report of the forum was submitted to the Department last year. The report has provided a very good insight into the areas where survivors feel that supports are required into the future. As the Deputy will be aware, there are also a number of other published reports highlighting the ongoing needs of survivors and the lifelong difficulties they encounter due to their childhood experiences in residential care. These reports, alongside other relevant submissions, are currently being considered by the Department with input from colleagues from other Departments. Significant resources continue to be devoted to the progressing of this work and will feed into the consideration of proposals to Government in this context. In parallel with this process, the Department has also been engaging with officials from other relevant Departments to identify existing services which are of particular relevance to survivors and to examine how these services can support survivors into the future. This engagement is also feeding into consideration of proposals to Government which will be progressed in the shortest timeframe possible. I would also like to note that as part of the State's response to individual's experience of stress as a result of trauma and abuse in childhood, a free professional and confidential national counselling service is operated by the HSE. Full details of this are available on the HSE's website.	spk_3

I want to acknowledge that the report of the consultative board, which was a very significant body of work, has been funded by the Department and externally facilitated. The fact that it was externally facilitated is hugely important. There was an independent facilitation of the entire process.

Deputy Ó Laoghaire outlined the variety of areas of interest of survivors and he will recognise that they are cross-departmental. We are engaged in a significant body of work. In terms of the body of work and the reports provided, I want to acknowledge that it has been valuable because it is these reports and submissions that are providing an insight into the issues which the survivors have nominated as being of most importance. The Department will continue to work with other Departments in many of the areas the Deputy highlighted, particularly in relation to areas of health and all the different issues that have been raised and were worked through in other instances. It is a significant body of work and it is continuing. I appreciate that we need the quickest resolution possible to this and I appreciate the urgency. It will be in the shortest timeframe possible. I am happy to keep the Deputy updated in that regard. A significant cross-departmental approach is being taken. In terms of resources, there are other agencies involved, aside from the Department of Education, and we are moving that work ahead as quickly as we can.	spk_5

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy for raising this Topical Issue matter. It has been raised with me previously by Senator McGreehan and others. At the outset I point out that Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, is the main policy initiative of the Department to address concentrated educational disadvantage at school level. The Department provides a wide range of supports to all schools, DEIS and non-DEIS, to support the inclusion of all students and address barriers to students achieving their potential. Supplementing these universal supports, the DEIS programme provides a targeted and equitable way to address concentrated educational disadvantage that promotes equity across the primary and post-primary sectors. As the Deputy referred to, I announced a major expansion of the DEIS programme in March, which means that for the first time since 2017, programmes have significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. The programme now includes more than 1,200 schools, and in effect this means one in four of all students are now supported in the DEIS programme. Schools added to the programme earlier this year were identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme through the refined DEIS identification model, which is an objective, statistics-based model. The DEIS identification process is based on the principle of concentrated disadvantage, and that is the issue. There may well be disadvantage in various schools, but it is the concentration of disadvantage in a particular school at the particular time of the undertaking of the model that is considered. It considers the proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school and the relative disadvantage within a given school. The development of this model involved an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group, which included officials from my Department, the Department's inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. The model used information from the schools' individual enrolment database and the 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP deprivation index. It also took into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation.A detailed document outlining the refined DEIS identification model is published on 	spk_11
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_3	I note the Deputy's concerns. The extension of the DEIS programme progresses the programme for Government commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model and to extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest concentration of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage. The concentration is the issue. The recent expansion will add an additional €32 million to the Department's expenditure on the DEIS programme for 2023, bringing the overall Department of Education allocation for 2023 to €180 million. I am very conscious of the benefits of the DEIS programme, as has been articulated. Analysis has shown that since the programme began in 2006, it has helped to close the gap in achievement between schools serving the highest levels of educational disadvantage and those serving populations with little or no disadvantage. However, I recognise there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools, not just DEIS schools and therefore under budget 2023, I secured funding for a number of measures that will support all children in this regard. This includes over €50 million to provide, as a permanent initiative, free books for all students in primary schools. I have also further improved the staffing schedule for primary schools to a ratio of 23:1, the lowest it has ever been, to benefit all schools. It is also important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. The next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. This will consider all schools within and outside the DEIS programme. Part of this scheme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders. I want to be clear on this point. Where a school does not achieve DEIS status, it does not mean that educational disadvantage does not exist but that the concentration of educational disadvantage between two schools is different. Unless there is a 100% reflection of the same students in each school, then both schools will be different. The issue here is not educational disadvantage but the concentration of it in one school over another. The system is open and fair. It uses the HP deprivation index with two additional weights for children who come from a background where there is homelessness, or children from a Traveller or Roma backgrounds. 	spk_13

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_3	I am very aware that primary and post-primary schools are experiencing challenges in recruiting substitute teachers. Newly qualified teachers, however, represent an additional source of supply for substitute and full-time posts in 2022 and 2023, with more than 3,600 primary and post-primary newly qualified teachers registered with the Teaching Council. Significant additional posts have been allocated to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue. This brings the total to 610 posts on 151 panels covering more than 2,840 schools. These panels were introduced as a pilot from 2019 and have significantly expanded since their introduction. While these panels work very effectively in many instances and are fully staffed in more than 90% of cases outside of Dublin I am conscious there is always room for improvement. To this end I have asked officials to review fully the operation of the supply panels. I have asked them to consider whether their use could be made more effective to support schools and whether additional measures could be taken to recruit teachers where there are vacancies. We have taken steps to alleviate some of the substitute supply pressures faced by schools. For the current school year job-sharing teachers may be employed to work in a substitute capacity. The limit on substitute work applying to teachers on career break has been suspended. Third and fourth year student teachers can register with the Teaching Council. More than 2,100 student teachers have applied for registration in this respect. Once registered, student teachers can be employed by a school to cover substitution of vacancies. As an example, approximately 800 second year Hibernia College professional master of education students have completed their latest school placement block and are available to the school system for the coming weeks. At post-primary level the Department has recently put in place a scheme that allows teachers to teach additional hours in their subject area over the usual 22-hour limit, up to a maximum of 20 additional hours per term. Retired teachers who maintain their Teaching Council registration can also provide substitute cover. The Department has agreed a waiver of abatement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for such teachers for up to 50 days in each of the three calendar years from 2021 to 2023, inclusive. The Department also runs a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of teachers and engages closely with school management bodies and other education stakeholders to inform this work. Today the national consultative forum on teacher supply, co-hosted by the Teaching Council and the Department of Education, is meeting, as referred to by the Deputy. This will include all of the key stakeholders in this area. Higher education institutions have developed new four-year initial teacher education programmes in a number of post-primary priority subject areas, including Irish, maths, computer science and modern foreign languages. In addition, the Department fully funds teachers to participate in upskilling programmes in maths, physics and Spanish. The first cohort of participants, approximately 170 teachers, is expected to graduate from these programmes this year and more than 300 teachers will graduate in 2023. We are also commencing the development of new upskilling programmes in other target subject areas, such as Irish. The Department also has a scheme to allow post-primary schools to share teachers, the aim of which is to recruit teachers in high-demand subjects and give teachers a full-time teaching contract. I strongly urge schools to explore this option as a means of supporting recruitment. These measures are underpinned by the Teaching Transforms campaign which promotes the teaching profession and encourages students to follow a career in teaching. The campaign is supported by the dedicated webpage on  It is acknowledged that despite these important actions, which have helped to some extent, work remains to be done to address the teacher supply challenge, particularly to ensure the availability of sufficient substitute teachers. The Department of Education will continue to work closely and intensively with stakeholders on this important matter.	spk_18
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. I appreciate his active engagement on this and his acknowledgement that many initiatives have been introduced to mitigate where there are issues. Notwithstanding this, I absolutely accept there are particular challenges in some areas more so than others. The significant action that has been taken ensures that, for example, we have the third and fourth year students coming onstream. We have more than 1,700 of them now registered. As we speak, if we were to take one higher education institute as an example, more than 800 students are now available from Hibernia for substitution. We have looked at retired teachers and provided the abatement for them. More than 800 of them have made themselves available for substitution work. We have lifted the restrictions on those job sharing and on career break. As the Deputy is aware, post-primary teachers can work additional hours. The Deputy referred to the review of the operation of the panels. No one knows more so than me the importance of having extended these panels. In 2019 there were six panels. Over the past two years this has increased to 151. This has been a very positive move. However, I am fair enough to acknowledge that clearly there are issues for some of the panels. It is important that we do a full review of how the panels are implemented and what potential there is to do things differently as we go forward. I understand the value of the panels and I want them to work better and more efficiently. Perhaps there is scope going forward. I also want to acknowledge, and we need to look at it in the round, that significant development and enhancement in education has taken place in the past two years. Over the past three budgets I have consistently reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to an historic low of 23:1. This has meant more teachers are being employed. We have administrative leave days for teaching principals. This means more teachers are being employed. Equally, where there are two special classes in a school there is automatic installation of administrative principal status. This means more teachers are being employed. More and more teachers are coming into the system. Obviously we have to look at the issue of substitution.We have made significant strides in initiatives in that regard. There is a meeting today and there will be more throughout the week. We are open to looking at everything that might address the issue.	spk_20

Supplementing these universal supports, the DEIS programme provides a targeted and equitable way to address concentrated educational disadvantage that promotes equity across the primary and post-primary sectors. As the Deputy referred to, I announced a major expansion of the DEIS programme in March, which means that for the first time since 2017, programmes have significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. The programme now includes more than 1,200 schools, and in effect this means one in four of all students are now supported in the DEIS programme. Schools added to the programme earlier this year were identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme through the refined DEIS identification model, which is an objective, statistics-based model. The DEIS identification process is based on the principle of concentrated disadvantage, and that is the issue. There may well be disadvantage in various schools, but it is the concentration of disadvantage in a particular school at the particular time of the undertaking of the model that is considered. It considers the proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school and the relative disadvantage within a given school. The development of this model involved an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group, which included officials from my Department, the Department's inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. The model used information from the schools' individual enrolment database and the 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP deprivation index. It also took into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation.A detailed document outlining the refined DEIS identification model is published on 	spk_11
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-30	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_6	I note the Deputy's concerns. The extension of the DEIS programme progresses the programme for Government commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model and to extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest concentration of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage. The concentration is the issue. The recent expansion will add an additional €32 million to the Department's expenditure on the DEIS programme for 2023, bringing the overall Department of Education allocation for 2023 to €180 million. I am very conscious of the benefits of the DEIS programme, as has been articulated. Analysis has shown that since the programme began in 2006, it has helped to close the gap in achievement between schools serving the highest levels of educational disadvantage and those serving populations with little or no disadvantage. However, I recognise there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools, not just DEIS schools and therefore under budget 2023, I secured funding for a number of measures that will support all children in this regard. This includes over €50 million to provide, as a permanent initiative, free books for all students in primary schools. I have also further improved the staffing schedule for primary schools to a ratio of 23:1, the lowest it has ever been, to benefit all schools. It is also important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. The next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. This will consider all schools within and outside the DEIS programme. Part of this scheme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders. I want to be clear on this point. Where a school does not achieve DEIS status, it does not mean that educational disadvantage does not exist but that the concentration of educational disadvantage between two schools is different. Unless there is a 100% reflection of the same students in each school, then both schools will be different. The issue here is not educational disadvantage but the concentration of it in one school over another. The system is open and fair. It uses the HP deprivation index with two additional weights for children who come from a background where there is homelessness, or children from a Traveller or Roma backgrounds. 	spk_13

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_7	I am very aware that primary and post-primary schools are experiencing challenges in recruiting substitute teachers. Newly qualified teachers, however, represent an additional source of supply for substitute and full-time posts in 2022 and 2023, with more than 3,600 primary and post-primary newly qualified teachers registered with the Teaching Council. Significant additional posts have been allocated to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue. This brings the total to 610 posts on 151 panels covering more than 2,840 schools. These panels were introduced as a pilot from 2019 and have significantly expanded since their introduction. While these panels work very effectively in many instances and are fully staffed in more than 90% of cases outside of Dublin I am conscious there is always room for improvement. To this end I have asked officials to review fully the operation of the supply panels. I have asked them to consider whether their use could be made more effective to support schools and whether additional measures could be taken to recruit teachers where there are vacancies. We have taken steps to alleviate some of the substitute supply pressures faced by schools. For the current school year job-sharing teachers may be employed to work in a substitute capacity. The limit on substitute work applying to teachers on career break has been suspended. Third and fourth year student teachers can register with the Teaching Council. More than 2,100 student teachers have applied for registration in this respect. Once registered, student teachers can be employed by a school to cover substitution of vacancies. As an example, approximately 800 second year Hibernia College professional master of education students have completed their latest school placement block and are available to the school system for the coming weeks. At post-primary level the Department has recently put in place a scheme that allows teachers to teach additional hours in their subject area over the usual 22-hour limit, up to a maximum of 20 additional hours per term. Retired teachers who maintain their Teaching Council registration can also provide substitute cover. The Department has agreed a waiver of abatement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for such teachers for up to 50 days in each of the three calendar years from 2021 to 2023, inclusive. The Department also runs a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of teachers and engages closely with school management bodies and other education stakeholders to inform this work. Today the national consultative forum on teacher supply, co-hosted by the Teaching Council and the Department of Education, is meeting, as referred to by the Deputy. This will include all of the key stakeholders in this area. Higher education institutions have developed new four-year initial teacher education programmes in a number of post-primary priority subject areas, including Irish, maths, computer science and modern foreign languages. In addition, the Department fully funds teachers to participate in upskilling programmes in maths, physics and Spanish. The first cohort of participants, approximately 170 teachers, is expected to graduate from these programmes this year and more than 300 teachers will graduate in 2023. We are also commencing the development of new upskilling programmes in other target subject areas, such as Irish. The Department also has a scheme to allow post-primary schools to share teachers, the aim of which is to recruit teachers in high-demand subjects and give teachers a full-time teaching contract. I strongly urge schools to explore this option as a means of supporting recruitment. These measures are underpinned by the Teaching Transforms campaign which promotes the teaching profession and encourages students to follow a career in teaching. The campaign is supported by the dedicated webpage on  It is acknowledged that despite these important actions, which have helped to some extent, work remains to be done to address the teacher supply challenge, particularly to ensure the availability of sufficient substitute teachers. The Department of Education will continue to work closely and intensively with stakeholders on this important matter.	spk_18
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_7	I thank the Deputy. I appreciate his active engagement on this and his acknowledgement that many initiatives have been introduced to mitigate where there are issues. Notwithstanding this, I absolutely accept there are particular challenges in some areas more so than others. The significant action that has been taken ensures that, for example, we have the third and fourth year students coming onstream. We have more than 1,700 of them now registered. As we speak, if we were to take one higher education institute as an example, more than 800 students are now available from Hibernia for substitution. We have looked at retired teachers and provided the abatement for them. More than 800 of them have made themselves available for substitution work. We have lifted the restrictions on those job sharing and on career break. As the Deputy is aware, post-primary teachers can work additional hours. The Deputy referred to the review of the operation of the panels. No one knows more so than me the importance of having extended these panels. In 2019 there were six panels. Over the past two years this has increased to 151. This has been a very positive move. However, I am fair enough to acknowledge that clearly there are issues for some of the panels. It is important that we do a full review of how the panels are implemented and what potential there is to do things differently as we go forward. I understand the value of the panels and I want them to work better and more efficiently. Perhaps there is scope going forward. I also want to acknowledge, and we need to look at it in the round, that significant development and enhancement in education has taken place in the past two years. Over the past three budgets I have consistently reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to an historic low of 23:1. This has meant more teachers are being employed. We have administrative leave days for teaching principals. This means more teachers are being employed. Equally, where there are two special classes in a school there is automatic installation of administrative principal status. This means more teachers are being employed. More and more teachers are coming into the system. Obviously we have to look at the issue of substitution.We have made significant strides in initiatives in that regard. There is a meeting today and there will be more throughout the week. We are open to looking at everything that might address the issue.	spk_20
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	I reiterate how heartbreaking and disturbing these revelations and all revelations of abuse are. Sexual abuse of a child by a teacher, school employee or any other person is a repugnant act. It is also a criminal act. In the first instance, it is, therefore, critical that crimes that have been committed are fully and thoroughly investigated by An Garda Síochána, and that process must not be compromised. I have met with a number of survivors in recent days and will continue to do so. I appreciate how bravely so many have openly shared their own harrowing experiences with me and I wish to give voice to the enormous hurt and trauma they and so many others have endured. It is important that there be an effective and survivor-led response from the Government. The Government is considering how best this can be achieved, having regard to both any Garda investigation and the wishes of survivors. As I said, I have engaged with a number of survivors over recent days to get a better understanding of what they would like to see happen and I will continue to do so as a priority in the coming days. There is considerable expertise and experience in this area, and it may also be helpful if we were to examine previous inquiries of different types and identify what lessons we can take from them in respect of how they operated and the outcomes achieved and, in particular, the impact on survivors. The Department of Education and I are committed to fully supporting whatever actions are agreed. I am also conscious that these revelations may have raised concerns about present day arrangements. In that regard, it is important to share with the House the significant changes that have taken place in our school environment since the era to which many of these allegations relate. Today we have a robust suite of measures in place to protect our children in the school environment. The Department's Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools 2017 provides guidance to schools on their responsibilities under the Children First Act 2015 and the Children First national guidance 2017.	spk_103
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	I acknowledge the Deputy's sincerity and the sincerity and unanimity across the House in expressing our revulsion and unequivocal condemnation of what has been visited upon so many children, young people, now adults, who continue to live with this repugnant trauma. I acknowledge, as the survivors have said to me, that they live with it, their families live with it and their wider communities live with it. The Deputy is 100% correct that it is my intention to consult all Opposition spokespersons, who will shortly receive notification in that regard. I very much want them to be part of the engagement and consideration of what we are about. He has been clear, and we have all been very clear, on the importance of the voice of the survivors. It is for that reason I am currently engaging with them. He is also correct that, as I have outlined, we have to be clear that there will be no impact, rightly, on the Garda inquiry, which must continue. This is an absolute priority, and I am happy to work across the House and with everybody to ensure we get the best possible outcome in respect of the type and scope of the inquiry.	spk_106
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	I appreciate the Deputy's genuine determination to engage with this, which is replicated across the House. I welcome that. It is important to note that we do have robust child protection measures in our schools, oversight of which is conducted by our inspectorate. Notwithstanding that, we are in a situation where we need to ensure that an appropriate inquiry is put in place to deal with all the abhorrent revelations that have come to light. To do that, it is important that there is sufficient engagement with all concerned. We will move at a pace.	spk_108
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	I am aware that some schools are currently experiencing challenges in recruiting teachers and I am conscious of the impact this could have on our schools. Newly qualified teachers, NQTs, represent an additional source of supply. More than 3,600 primary and post-primary NQTs are registered with the Teaching Council this year. In May 2021, the Department published an updated technical report - Developing a Teacher Demand and Supply Model for Ireland 2020-2038. The report projects a decrease in demand for primary teachers to 2036 while at post-primary level the downward trend in demand starts from 2024. Work is ongoing to produce projections of post-primary teacher demand and supply on a subject level basis. The IPPN, in line with the teacher supply action plan, has developed a portal for the recruitment of teachers to long-term teaching positions. The IPPN also operates a sub seeker, which has almost 12,000 teachers registered with it. Significant additional posts have been allocated to the primary substitute teacher supply panels bringing the total number up to 151 panels. For the current school year, job sharing teachers may be employed to work in a substitute capacity and the limit on substitute work applying to teachers on career break has been suspended. Third and fourth year student teachers can now register with the Teaching Council and more than 2,100 student teachers have applied for registration.  At post-primary level, the Department has recently put in place a scheme that allows teachers teach additional hours in their subject area over the usual 22-hour weekly limit, up to a maximum of 20 additional hours per term. Furthermore, retired teachers who maintain their registration can provide substitute cover and the Department has agreed a waiver of abatement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for such teachers. The Department runs a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of teachers and engages closely with the school management bodies and other education stakeholders. Higher education institutions, HEIs, have developed new four-year initial teacher education undergraduate programmes in a number of post-primary priority subjects, including Irish, mathematics, computer science and modern foreign languages. I wish to advise the Deputy that the process for the approval of the intake on the primary bachelor of education, BEd, programme and professional master of education, PME, programme for the 2023-24 academic year has commenced and the State-funded HEIs will be advised of this shortly.	spk_110
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	We need to look at this in the round. We have seen significant changes, enhancements and improvements in education over the past two years both at primary and post-primary level. For example, at primary level, over the past three budgets we ensured that there has been a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio. It is an historic low of 23:1. We have ensured that all teaching principals have at least one administration day in respect of leave. Where schools have a teaching principal and two or more special classes, they are automatic administrative principals. All that is positive and proactive. It needed to be done and has been welcomed by all. It does have an impact. To compensate for that and the requirement for additional teachers, we have proactively looked at measures. We have lifted restrictions around job share, career break and retired teachers. More than 800 retired teachers came on stream last year. There are other initiatives. The Deputy referenced the post-primary sector. We have introduced the share a teacher model under which teachers can be shared between schools. There are upskilling courses at post-primary level that are fully funded by the Department in key areas. We are beholden to our third and fourth year student teachers who can now register with the Teaching Council. More than 800 Hibernia students will come on stream and that is only one HEI when it comes to availability to work in the coming weeks.	spk_112
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	The Deputy has to concede that we have looked at a variety of different methods. We have been proactive in this area, notwithstanding the challenges in teacher supply. In the interest of balance, the issues being faced in the education sector are not unique. We are seeing similar issues in other sectors whether it is hospitality, retail, healthcare or whatever. This is the position we find ourselves in at this time. We have an unprecedented climate internationally and all the other issues. We have examined a number of measures and put measures in place. I am open to looking at all measures.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	The Government recognises the cost of preparing children for school each September can be a financial difficulty and challenge for many families. Therefore, as part of budget 2023, I announced over €50 million to provide free books to primary school pupils within the free education system from September 2023. This measure will eliminate the cost to these families of all schoolbooks at primary school, including workbooks. It delivers on the programme for Government commitment to extend the free schoolbook pilot, currently in 102 DEIS primary schools, as resources permit. The free primary schoolbooks scheme will benefit up to 540,000 pupils in approximately 3,240 recognised primary schools, including over 130 special schools. The implementation of the measure will build on the existing schoolbook rental scheme, which is available in some 94% of recognised primary schools. It also builds the free schoolbooks pilot I mentioned.  My officials are continuing to engage on how the scheme will operate. Initial contact has been made with some of the education partners on the measure. Over the coming period, my Department will be engaging further with the education partners and other stakeholders to roll out the measure in sufficient time for the 2023–24 school year. Guidance on the procurement of books will be developed as part of our further engagement process with schools, parent and management bodies and other stakeholders on this measure. The scheme will seek to ensure that value for money is achieved and that schools will be supported to implement the scheme in a way that has the best learning outcomes for pupils. Schools will continue to have autonomy to choose books that meet curricular requirements. My Department will consider the information from the 102 schools involved in the free schoolbook pilot when developing the guidance on the procurement of books. It is planned that funds will be provided to schools to purchase schoolbooks and related classroom resources. Schools buy books directly from schoolbook suppliers at present as part of the implementation of the schoolbook rental scheme. Ninety-six percent of primary schools participate in the scheme. As Minister for Education, I am acutely aware of the costs faced by families upon the return of their children to school each September. This will be a ground-breaking measure.	spk_116

I am beginning the process at primary level but it is my hope and expectation that it will in time progress to post-primary level. We already have a very successful book rental scheme, operated by 96% of our schools. With regard to engaging with book publishers and booksellers, schools will have autonomy regarding how they engage. If they wish to engage with a local distributor, they may do so. I made that very clear when I make my announcement and continue to do so. There are lessons to be learned from the book rental scheme. There are also lessons to be learned from the pilot programme we have run for DEIS schools. All of that has been brought to bear. Initial discussions have taken place with the partners in education, and these will continue. The engagement will be fully consultative.

In the last school year, more than 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The cost of the scheme in 2021 was €289 million. In July 2022 and as part of a wider package of cost-of-living measures, the Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year for those who were eligible for the scheme. Ticket registration for the 2022-23 school year closed on 29 July, by which time almost 130,000 applications for mainstream school transport had been received. This figure included 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from previous years. This time last year, there were approximately 103,600 children on school transport scheme services. Already, more than 127,800 tickets for the 2022-23 school year have been issued to applicants, meaning that in the region of 24,200 additional places have been created. This is an increase of 23%. Specifically, there has been an increase of 33% in concessionary tickets. Children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national schools and at post-primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary schools or education centres, as determined by the Department. All children who are eligible for school transport and have completed the application process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the school transport scheme, temporary alleviation measures at post-primary level have continued for the 2022-23 school year. Under these measures, pupils are eligible for transport to their next nearest schools. As part of the budgetary process, some additional funding has been approved for the scheme, which has allowed officials in the Department, in consultation with Bus Éireann, to provide additional capacity where it is possible to do so. Bus Éireann has been prioritising areas where there are students who did not meet the eligibility criteria but were ""on time concessionary pupils"" and had tickets previously. It is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations. Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity."	spk_145

Regarding the late application process, it is important for families to note that the application deadline was 29 April and that the deadline to confirm registration was 29 July. Any application completed after this date was a ""late application"" and, therefore, many school transport services were already operating at full capacity.

The National Development Plan 2021-2030, published on 4 October 2021, provides for capital funding of more than €4.4 billion for investment in school infrastructure during the period from 2021 to 2025. There continues to be a strong climate action dimension to this additional capacity and modernisation programme. Schools designed and built in accordance with the Department’s technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 building energy ratings since 2009, with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher energy performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the current building regulations. In addition, 10% of primary energy is provided via solar panels and there is infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging. As the Deputy will be aware, budget 2023 provided for the provision of funding from the climate action fund in respect of the provision of solar panels in schools up to 6 kW output. This is really positive news, which I am sure the Deputy will welcome, and will assist with schools’ energy needs and costs along with supporting the decarbonisation of our school buildings. Departmental officials are working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the arrangements for this scheme and details will be announced in the shortest timeframe possible. The provision of the solar panels will be fully funded for schools. I will also announce in due course a climate action summer works programme to progress climate action specific initiatives that will assist with the roll-out of smaller scale energy retrofit works in schools. The summer works programme has for many years featured categories that assist in improving energy reduction in schools such as heating system upgrades, roof insulation upgrades, high-performance window upgrades and electrical upgrades. The Departments of Education and the Environment, Climate and Communications have established a jointly funded pathfinder programme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the planning and building unit in my Department. Support is also provided by Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board, ETB, in respect of the programme.	spk_159

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	The criteria for the award of incremental credit to recognised teachers were agreed under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council, TCC. This council comprises representatives of teachers, school management and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Education. The council is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission. The TCC meets at least every two months and the agenda is agreed between the Department and the teacher unions. The award criteria for incremental credit are laid out in the Department’s circulars for primary teachers and post-primary teachers. These circulars provide for the awarding of incremental credit for both teaching service and relevant non-teaching service that has taken place abroad. Under the auspices of the TCC, a subcommittee has been set up to deal with incremental credit issues. Officials from my Department are considering a submission that the teachers’ unions lodged at the TCC subcommittee regarding the rules relating to incremental credit. An update on the progress of this work is provided at each TCC meeting. On conclusion of these negotiations at the TCC, the Department plans to replace existing circulars with a consolidated circular that will be applicable to both primary and post-primary teachers. The TCC subcommittee meets four times per year and is currently considering many items including the removal of the seven-year cap on incremental credit for teaching service outside of the EU and the alignment of primary and post-primary rules relating to service in private schools outside the EU. Work is ongoing on this submission and the next subcommittee meeting is scheduled for January 2023. As for measures to attract teachers returning to the Irish education system, I fully appreciate that, as the Deputy noted, this issue is a consideration for many of them. Nevertheless, it is a significant step forward that we have the subcommittee and the issue of incremental credit is being adjudicated on, discussed and engaged with by it.	spk_167
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	I appreciate that a body of work needs to be done in this regard. As the Deputy acknowledged, it is positive that this is now the work and consideration of the sub-committee. We must be clear that the TCC is made up of a variety of bodies. It is not just the Department of Education. It is also made up of teachers' representatives, school management and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order that there is a full, frank and open discussion as regards what we can do. It is my hope and expectation that this will be prioritised in terms of moving it apace. There is an absolute commitment around looking with priority at the specific issues I already raised, whether it is the seven-year cap for those outside of the EU or the alignment of primary and post-primary conditions into one system. The next meeting of the subcommittee is scheduled to take place in January. It is difficult to give a particular timeline but it is being given the highest priority.	spk_169

It is intended that the school will move to interim accommodation and a permanent site at Mount Anville for September 2023. With regard to the interim accommodation for Gaelscoil Laighean, an application for planning permission was lodged for the Mount Anville depot site on 21 June 2022. The final grant of permission issued from Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council on 16 September 2022 with 18 conditions. My Department’s design team responded to the council on these conditions on 5 October 2022 and is currently liaising with the local authority to finalise and agree all pre-commencement conditions to allow the building contractor to commence work on the site. The contractor has been appointed. Agreement in principle for the acquisition of the permanent site was reached with the executive of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council in June 2021, subject to the approval of the elected members of the council. The approval by the elected members to dispose of the lands to the Minister for Education was granted at a council meeting in April 2022. This acquisition is subject to the successful grant of planning permission for the permanent school facility. With regard to the permanent school building project, the Department has commenced the tender process for the appointment of the project manager for the delivery programme, which includes Gaelscoil Laighean. An expression of interest notice was published on the eTenders portal on 14 November. Once the project manager is appointed, he or she will commence the tender process for the appointment of the design team that will take the project forward through the stages of architectural planning to tender and construction. The school and its patron body will be kept fully informed as these steps are progressed. Gaelscoil Laighean is part of a strong pipeline of school building projects for delivery under the Government’s national development plan. The Department has a strong track record of delivery with more than 360 school building projects at construction during 2022, including more than 50 new schools. The Department has an allocation of €4.4 billion to facilitate delivery during the period 2021 to 2025.	spk_175
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	I want to be clear; the planning system is the planning system. In the first instance, however, I totally reject the Deputy's view in terms of the Department of Education and its delivery of school buildings and knowledge of planning. The Department has an extremely strong record of delivery in terms of school buildings. More than 360 school building projects were at construction during 2022. That is a phenomenal investment by the Department. That includes brand new schools, of which there are more than 50. The Department also has an allocation of €4.4 billion to facilitate delivery during the 2021 to 2025 school period. Specifically with regard to Gaelscoil Laighean, the application for the Mount Anville site was lodged in June 2022. Planning was granted on 16 September 2022, with conditions.

The grant of planning permission was received on 16 September 2022. The Department officials, the project manager and the design team have engaged with the planning roles and departments within Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to agree the works required for the public road and junction outside of the school site, as required on condition No. 7 of the planning permission. The last communication from the local authority to our design team on 17 November indicated that the council is finalising its programme of work for Mount Anville and Deerpark Road. The works to the road junction to be carried out by my Department for the interim accommodation for the school are required to align with the council’s programme of work. Both the design team of my Department and the local authority are jointly working to agree that alignment. Specifically, on the permanent project, once the project manager is appointed, the tender process will commence for the appointment of a design team which will take the project forward through the stages of architectural planning, including preparation of the planning application to the local authority. It is not possible at this time, in advance of the appointment of the project manager, the design team and ahead of the pre-planning consultations with the local authority, to indicate when the planning permission for the project will be secured. Considerable work has been done, however, and the school will be kept informed via its patron, which I believe is An Foras Pátrúnachta.	spk_179
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	I thank the Deputy for her question. As Minister for Education, the online safety of our children and young people is a priority both for myself and my Department. Within the education system, the current social, personal and health education curriculum, known as SPHE, at primary level covers the important topics of personal safety and protection, and includes online safety. This SPHE curriculum content aims to foster well-being, self-confidence and seeks to develop the child’s own sense of personal responsibility. This learning is built on at post-primary level. Here students learn how to exercise judgment, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices that guide them towards considered decision-making, begin to understand their own rights and the rights of others, and explore decision-making in all aspects of their lives including online. The SPHE specifications, as the Deputy is aware, are currently being redeveloped by the NCCA. The immediate focus of the work has been on creating support materials for teachers, with the NCCA online SPHE toolkits being expanded during 2022. As part of the redevelopment work, we have specifically referred to the need to ensure that the specifications are modern and up to date in respect of the online world and its impact on children. The junior cycle draft SPHE specification was subject to a consultation process which concluded in October 2022. It is expected that the specification will be finalised by the end of this year, with implementation in schools in September 2023. With regard to senior cycle SPHE, consultation is expected by next summer and it is expected that the curriculum will be ready for implementation in schools in September 2024. At primary level it is expected that the new curriculum will be in schools in 2025.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, funded by my Department, offers professional learning opportunities and resources to teachers and school leaders in a range of curricular and educational areas, including supports on the prevention of online bullying and harassment. In particular, Webwise which is part of the PDST technology in education, promotes the effective and safe use of the Internet through a sustained information and awareness strategy. It also addresses key issues such as cyberbullying, sexting, image sharing, respectful communication, social media, popular apps and much more.	spk_182
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	I completely agree with the Deputy. We are living in a much-changed and very different world now and it is important that we have an agile workforce. It is also important that we have students who are well informed and capable of living safely in this world. I want to be clear that there are a number of initiatives under way, while we are talking about the redevelopment of the primary school curriculum, and equally so of SPHE at post-primary level. Significant resources in the interim are being made available to our staff specifically in respect of cyber bullying and online safety. Equally the PDST has a very strong continuing professional development, CPD, roll-out into our schools to support our staff. We also have the digital strategy for our schools which sets out the policy of the Department of Education on the effective use of digital technologies and teaching learning and assessment. The key action under the strategy is the promotion of the responsible and ethical use of the Internet and related technologies. That all feeds into practice within our schools.	spk_184
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_14	I appreciate the Deputy’s interest in this area and indeed her shining a light on it. It behoves us to acknowledge the world in which we live today. Significant progress has been made by the Department. There is also a recognition that more needs to be done in this space and it is for that reason there is the review of the programmes we deliver. In the interim, we have made the toolkits available, and we have, as the Deputy has referred to, supports such as Webwise. We also have our PDST, which is specifically supporting our staff, the toolkits that are available online. The whole impetus for all of this is to ensure we can have respectful online communications through the development of digital literacy, as the Deputy has said, which is very important. We want our young people to have digital literacy, but also that they would be cognisant and mindful of the need for online safety and the safe and ethical use of all digital technologies, which is at the core of all we seek to achieve.	spk_186
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Child Abuse	dbsect_15	I reiterate how heartbreaking and disturbing these revelations and all revelations of abuse are. Sexual abuse of a child by a teacher, school employee or any other person is a repugnant act. It is also a criminal act. In the first instance, it is, therefore, critical that crimes that have been committed are fully and thoroughly investigated by An Garda Síochána, and that process must not be compromised. I have met with a number of survivors in recent days and will continue to do so. I appreciate how bravely so many have openly shared their own harrowing experiences with me and I wish to give voice to the enormous hurt and trauma they and so many others have endured. It is important that there be an effective and survivor-led response from the Government. The Government is considering how best this can be achieved, having regard to both any Garda investigation and the wishes of survivors. As I said, I have engaged with a number of survivors over recent days to get a better understanding of what they would like to see happen and I will continue to do so as a priority in the coming days. There is considerable expertise and experience in this area, and it may also be helpful if we were to examine previous inquiries of different types and identify what lessons we can take from them in respect of how they operated and the outcomes achieved and, in particular, the impact on survivors. The Department of Education and I are committed to fully supporting whatever actions are agreed. I am also conscious that these revelations may have raised concerns about present day arrangements. In that regard, it is important to share with the House the significant changes that have taken place in our school environment since the era to which many of these allegations relate. Today we have a robust suite of measures in place to protect our children in the school environment. The Department's Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools 2017 provides guidance to schools on their responsibilities under the Children First Act 2015 and the Children First national guidance 2017.	spk_103

I acknowledge, as the survivors have said to me, that they live with it, their families live with it and their wider communities live with it. The Deputy is 100% correct that it is my intention to consult all Opposition spokespersons, who will shortly receive notification in that regard. I very much want them to be part of the engagement and consideration of what we are about. He has been clear, and we have all been very clear, on the importance of the voice of the survivors. It is for that reason I am currently engaging with them. He is also correct that, as I have outlined, we have to be clear that there will be no impact, rightly, on the Garda inquiry, which must continue. This is an absolute priority, and I am happy to work across the House and with everybody to ensure we get the best possible outcome in respect of the type and scope of the inquiry.	spk_106

Notwithstanding that, we are in a situation where we need to ensure that an appropriate inquiry is put in place to deal with all the abhorrent revelations that have come to light. To do that, it is important that there is sufficient engagement with all concerned. We will move at a pace.	spk_108
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_16	I am aware that some schools are currently experiencing challenges in recruiting teachers and I am conscious of the impact this could have on our schools. Newly qualified teachers, NQTs, represent an additional source of supply. More than 3,600 primary and post-primary NQTs are registered with the Teaching Council this year. In May 2021, the Department published an updated technical report - Developing a Teacher Demand and Supply Model for Ireland 2020-2038. The report projects a decrease in demand for primary teachers to 2036 while at post-primary level the downward trend in demand starts from 2024. Work is ongoing to produce projections of post-primary teacher demand and supply on a subject level basis. The IPPN, in line with the teacher supply action plan, has developed a portal for the recruitment of teachers to long-term teaching positions. The IPPN also operates a sub seeker, which has almost 12,000 teachers registered with it. Significant additional posts have been allocated to the primary substitute teacher supply panels bringing the total number up to 151 panels. For the current school year, job sharing teachers may be employed to work in a substitute capacity and the limit on substitute work applying to teachers on career break has been suspended. Third and fourth year student teachers can now register with the Teaching Council and more than 2,100 student teachers have applied for registration.  At post-primary level, the Department has recently put in place a scheme that allows teachers teach additional hours in their subject area over the usual 22-hour weekly limit, up to a maximum of 20 additional hours per term. Furthermore, retired teachers who maintain their registration can provide substitute cover and the Department has agreed a waiver of abatement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for such teachers. The Department runs a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of teachers and engages closely with the school management bodies and other education stakeholders. Higher education institutions, HEIs, have developed new four-year initial teacher education undergraduate programmes in a number of post-primary priority subjects, including Irish, mathematics, computer science and modern foreign languages. I wish to advise the Deputy that the process for the approval of the intake on the primary bachelor of education, BEd, programme and professional master of education, PME, programme for the 2023-24 academic year has commenced and the State-funded HEIs will be advised of this shortly.	spk_110
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_16	We need to look at this in the round. We have seen significant changes, enhancements and improvements in education over the past two years both at primary and post-primary level. For example, at primary level, over the past three budgets we ensured that there has been a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio. It is an historic low of 23:1. We have ensured that all teaching principals have at least one administration day in respect of leave. Where schools have a teaching principal and two or more special classes, they are automatic administrative principals. All that is positive and proactive. It needed to be done and has been welcomed by all. It does have an impact. To compensate for that and the requirement for additional teachers, we have proactively looked at measures. We have lifted restrictions around job share, career break and retired teachers. More than 800 retired teachers came on stream last year. There are other initiatives. The Deputy referenced the post-primary sector. We have introduced the share a teacher model under which teachers can be shared between schools. There are upskilling courses at post-primary level that are fully funded by the Department in key areas. We are beholden to our third and fourth year student teachers who can now register with the Teaching Council. More than 800 Hibernia students will come on stream and that is only one HEI when it comes to availability to work in the coming weeks.	spk_112

We have been proactive in this area, notwithstanding the challenges in teacher supply. In the interest of balance, the issues being faced in the education sector are not unique. We are seeing similar issues in other sectors whether it is hospitality, retail, healthcare or whatever. This is the position we find ourselves in at this time. We have an unprecedented climate internationally and all the other issues. We have examined a number of measures and put measures in place. I am open to looking at all measures. We have a positive contracts of indefinite duration programme in place, which is a positive move for staff, and we keep everything under review. I am happy to do that.	spk_114
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	School Textbooks	dbsect_17	The Government recognises the cost of preparing children for school each September can be a financial difficulty and challenge for many families. Therefore, as part of budget 2023, I announced over €50 million to provide free books to primary school pupils within the free education system from September 2023. This measure will eliminate the cost to these families of all schoolbooks at primary school, including workbooks. It delivers on the programme for Government commitment to extend the free schoolbook pilot, currently in 102 DEIS primary schools, as resources permit. The free primary schoolbooks scheme will benefit up to 540,000 pupils in approximately 3,240 recognised primary schools, including over 130 special schools. The implementation of the measure will build on the existing schoolbook rental scheme, which is available in some 94% of recognised primary schools. It also builds the free schoolbooks pilot I mentioned.  My officials are continuing to engage on how the scheme will operate. Initial contact has been made with some of the education partners on the measure. Over the coming period, my Department will be engaging further with the education partners and other stakeholders to roll out the measure in sufficient time for the 2023–24 school year. Guidance on the procurement of books will be developed as part of our further engagement process with schools, parent and management bodies and other stakeholders on this measure. The scheme will seek to ensure that value for money is achieved and that schools will be supported to implement the scheme in a way that has the best learning outcomes for pupils. Schools will continue to have autonomy to choose books that meet curricular requirements. My Department will consider the information from the 102 schools involved in the free schoolbook pilot when developing the guidance on the procurement of books. It is planned that funds will be provided to schools to purchase schoolbooks and related classroom resources. Schools buy books directly from schoolbook suppliers at present as part of the implementation of the schoolbook rental scheme. Ninety-six percent of primary schools participate in the scheme. As Minister for Education, I am acutely aware of the costs faced by families upon the return of their children to school each September. This will be a ground-breaking measure.	spk_116

With regard to engaging with book publishers and booksellers, schools will have autonomy regarding how they engage. If they wish to engage with a local distributor, they may do so. I made that very clear when I make my announcement and continue to do so. There are lessons to be learned from the book rental scheme. There are also lessons to be learned from the pilot programme we have run for DEIS schools. All of that has been brought to bear. Initial discussions have taken place with the partners in education, and these will continue. The engagement will be fully consultative.

In the last school year, more than 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The cost of the scheme in 2021 was €289 million. In July 2022 and as part of a wider package of cost-of-living measures, the Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year for those who were eligible for the scheme. Ticket registration for the 2022-23 school year closed on 29 July, by which time almost 130,000 applications for mainstream school transport had been received. This figure included 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from previous years. This time last year, there were approximately 103,600 children on school transport scheme services. Already, more than 127,800 tickets for the 2022-23 school year have been issued to applicants, meaning that in the region of 24,200 additional places have been created. This is an increase of 23%. Specifically, there has been an increase of 33% in concessionary tickets. Children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national schools and at post-primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary schools or education centres, as determined by the Department. All children who are eligible for school transport and have completed the application process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the school transport scheme, temporary alleviation measures at post-primary level have continued for the 2022-23 school year. Under these measures, pupils are eligible for transport to their next nearest schools. As part of the budgetary process, some additional funding has been approved for the scheme, which has allowed officials in the Department, in consultation with Bus Éireann, to provide additional capacity where it is possible to do so. Bus Éireann has been prioritising areas where there are students who did not meet the eligibility criteria but were ""on time concessionary pupils"" and had tickets previously. It is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations. Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity."	spk_145

Regarding the late application process, it is important for families to note that the application deadline was 29 April and that the deadline to confirm registration was 29 July. Any application completed after this date was a ""late application"" and, therefore, many school transport services were already operating at full capacity. While a number of late applications have been received, eligibility can only be determined at the time of assessment.

The National Development Plan 2021-2030, published on 4 October 2021, provides for capital funding of more than €4.4 billion for investment in school infrastructure during the period from 2021 to 2025. There continues to be a strong climate action dimension to this additional capacity and modernisation programme. Schools designed and built in accordance with the Department’s technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 building energy ratings since 2009, with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher energy performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the current building regulations. In addition, 10% of primary energy is provided via solar panels and there is infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging. As the Deputy will be aware, budget 2023 provided for the provision of funding from the climate action fund in respect of the provision of solar panels in schools up to 6 kW output. This is really positive news, which I am sure the Deputy will welcome, and will assist with schools’ energy needs and costs along with supporting the decarbonisation of our school buildings. Departmental officials are working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the arrangements for this scheme and details will be announced in the shortest timeframe possible. The provision of the solar panels will be fully funded for schools. I will also announce in due course a climate action summer works programme to progress climate action specific initiatives that will assist with the roll-out of smaller scale energy retrofit works in schools. The summer works programme has for many years featured categories that assist in improving energy reduction in schools such as heating system upgrades, roof insulation upgrades, high-performance window upgrades and electrical upgrades. The Departments of Education and the Environment, Climate and Communications have established a jointly funded pathfinder programme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the planning and building unit in my Department. Support is also provided by Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board, ETB, in respect of the programme.	spk_159
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Environmental Schemes	dbsect_22	I agree that this is a very positive move, and I welcome the fact schools will be eligible for the programme and it will be fully funded for them. Much work is being done in this regard and it is the absolute intention to roll it out as quickly as possible. Obviously, this is not within the gift of just my Department, but we are working constructively to ensure it will be delivered as quickly as possible. I acknowledge the Deputy's reference to the deep energy retrofit programme, a significant and successful programme on which tens of millions of euro have been spent by the Department. We have seen the benefit in very many schools throughout the country and it is our ambition to grow that initiative. Much of the leadership and impetus for climate action and sustainability is coming from young people in our schools. There is a strong body of work in this area and we are continuing to move at pace.	spk_161
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Environmental Schemes	dbsect_22	The Department has many award-winning schemes that are internationally recognised for their agenda and for the priority given by the Department in the area of climate action and sustainability, and we have a strong strategy in that area as well. I mentioned the pathfinder programme and the solar panel scheme, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and I acknowledge the work of my ministerial colleague in that regard. As the Deputy knows, the summer works programme is invaluable to our schools for lesser initiatives but is equally important and impactful within our schools. It is envisaged the new climate-focused multiannual summer works programme will open for new applications in early 2023 and it will have the climate action initiative embedded in it.	spk_163

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_23	The criteria for the award of incremental credit to recognised teachers were agreed under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council, TCC. This council comprises representatives of teachers, school management and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Education. The council is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission. The TCC meets at least every two months and the agenda is agreed between the Department and the teacher unions. The award criteria for incremental credit are laid out in the Department’s circulars for primary teachers and post-primary teachers. These circulars provide for the awarding of incremental credit for both teaching service and relevant non-teaching service that has taken place abroad. Under the auspices of the TCC, a subcommittee has been set up to deal with incremental credit issues. Officials from my Department are considering a submission that the teachers’ unions lodged at the TCC subcommittee regarding the rules relating to incremental credit. An update on the progress of this work is provided at each TCC meeting. On conclusion of these negotiations at the TCC, the Department plans to replace existing circulars with a consolidated circular that will be applicable to both primary and post-primary teachers. The TCC subcommittee meets four times per year and is currently considering many items including the removal of the seven-year cap on incremental credit for teaching service outside of the EU and the alignment of primary and post-primary rules relating to service in private schools outside the EU. Work is ongoing on this submission and the next subcommittee meeting is scheduled for January 2023. As for measures to attract teachers returning to the Irish education system, I fully appreciate that, as the Deputy noted, this issue is a consideration for many of them. Nevertheless, it is a significant step forward that we have the subcommittee and the issue of incremental credit is being adjudicated on, discussed and engaged with by it.	spk_167
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_23	I appreciate that a body of work needs to be done in this regard. As the Deputy acknowledged, it is positive that this is now the work and consideration of the sub-committee. We must be clear that the TCC is made up of a variety of bodies. It is not just the Department of Education. It is also made up of teachers' representatives, school management and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order that there is a full, frank and open discussion as regards what we can do. It is my hope and expectation that this will be prioritised in terms of moving it apace. There is an absolute commitment around looking with priority at the specific issues I already raised, whether it is the seven-year cap for those outside of the EU or the alignment of primary and post-primary conditions into one system. The next meeting of the subcommittee is scheduled to take place in January. It is difficult to give a particular timeline but it is being given the highest priority.	spk_169

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	Gaelscoil Laighean is currently located in interim accommodation in a building at Kill Lane and a room is also rented from the Mount Merrion parish centre, which is located directly across the road. It is intended that the school will move to interim accommodation and a permanent site at Mount Anville for September 2023. With regard to the interim accommodation for Gaelscoil Laighean, an application for planning permission was lodged for the Mount Anville depot site on 21 June 2022. The final grant of permission issued from Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council on 16 September 2022 with 18 conditions. My Department’s design team responded to the council on these conditions on 5 October 2022 and is currently liaising with the local authority to finalise and agree all pre-commencement conditions to allow the building contractor to commence work on the site. The contractor has been appointed. Agreement in principle for the acquisition of the permanent site was reached with the executive of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council in June 2021, subject to the approval of the elected members of the council. The approval by the elected members to dispose of the lands to the Minister for Education was granted at a council meeting in April 2022. This acquisition is subject to the successful grant of planning permission for the permanent school facility. With regard to the permanent school building project, the Department has commenced the tender process for the appointment of the project manager for the delivery programme, which includes Gaelscoil Laighean. An expression of interest notice was published on the eTenders portal on 14 November. Once the project manager is appointed, he or she will commence the tender process for the appointment of the design team that will take the project forward through the stages of architectural planning to tender and construction. The school and its patron body will be kept fully informed as these steps are progressed. Gaelscoil Laighean is part of a strong pipeline of school building projects for delivery under the Government’s national development plan. The Department has a strong track record of delivery with more than 360 school building projects at construction during 2022, including more than 50 new schools. The Department has an allocation of €4.4 billion to facilitate delivery during the period 2021 to 2025.	spk_175
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I want to be clear; the planning system is the planning system. In the first instance, however, I totally reject the Deputy's view in terms of the Department of Education and its delivery of school buildings and knowledge of planning. The Department has an extremely strong record of delivery in terms of school buildings. More than 360 school building projects were at construction during 2022. That is a phenomenal investment by the Department. That includes brand new schools, of which there are more than 50. The Department also has an allocation of €4.4 billion to facilitate delivery during the 2021 to 2025 school period. Specifically with regard to Gaelscoil Laighean, the application for the Mount Anville site was lodged in June 2022. Planning was granted on 16 September 2022, with conditions. The Department's design team responded to the council on these conditions on 5 October and is currently liaising with the local authority to finalise and agree all pre-commencement conditions to allow the building contractor to commence the work on site. The contractor has also been appointed.	spk_177

The grant of planning permission was received on 16 September 2022. The Department officials, the project manager and the design team have engaged with the planning roles and departments within Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to agree the works required for the public road and junction outside of the school site, as required on condition No. 7 of the planning permission. The last communication from the local authority to our design team on 17 November indicated that the council is finalising its programme of work for Mount Anville and Deerpark Road. The works to the road junction to be carried out by my Department for the interim accommodation for the school are required to align with the council’s programme of work. Both the design team of my Department and the local authority are jointly working to agree that alignment. Specifically, on the permanent project, once the project manager is appointed, the tender process will commence for the appointment of a design team which will take the project forward through the stages of architectural planning, including preparation of the planning application to the local authority. It is not possible at this time, in advance of the appointment of the project manager, the design team and ahead of the pre-planning consultations with the local authority, to indicate when the planning permission for the project will be secured. Considerable work has been done, however, and the school will be kept informed via its patron, which I believe is An Foras Pátrúnachta.	spk_179
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Online Safety	dbsect_25	I thank the Deputy for her question. As Minister for Education, the online safety of our children and young people is a priority both for myself and my Department. Within the education system, the current social, personal and health education curriculum, known as SPHE, at primary level covers the important topics of personal safety and protection, and includes online safety. This SPHE curriculum content aims to foster well-being, self-confidence and seeks to develop the child’s own sense of personal responsibility. This learning is built on at post-primary level. Here students learn how to exercise judgment, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices that guide them towards considered decision-making, begin to understand their own rights and the rights of others, and explore decision-making in all aspects of their lives including online. The SPHE specifications, as the Deputy is aware, are currently being redeveloped by the NCCA. The immediate focus of the work has been on creating support materials for teachers, with the NCCA online SPHE toolkits being expanded during 2022. As part of the redevelopment work, we have specifically referred to the need to ensure that the specifications are modern and up to date in respect of the online world and its impact on children. The junior cycle draft SPHE specification was subject to a consultation process which concluded in October 2022. It is expected that the specification will be finalised by the end of this year, with implementation in schools in September 2023. With regard to senior cycle SPHE, consultation is expected by next summer and it is expected that the curriculum will be ready for implementation in schools in September 2024. At primary level it is expected that the new curriculum will be in schools in 2025.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, funded by my Department, offers professional learning opportunities and resources to teachers and school leaders in a range of curricular and educational areas, including supports on the prevention of online bullying and harassment. In particular, Webwise which is part of the PDST technology in education, promotes the effective and safe use of the Internet through a sustained information and awareness strategy. It also addresses key issues such as cyberbullying, sexting, image sharing, respectful communication, social media, popular apps and much more.	spk_182
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Online Safety	dbsect_25	I completely agree with the Deputy. We are living in a much-changed and very different world now and it is important that we have an agile workforce. It is also important that we have students who are well informed and capable of living safely in this world. I want to be clear that there are a number of initiatives under way, while we are talking about the redevelopment of the primary school curriculum, and equally so of SPHE at post-primary level. Significant resources in the interim are being made available to our staff specifically in respect of cyber bullying and online safety. Equally the PDST has a very strong continuing professional development, CPD, roll-out into our schools to support our staff. We also have the digital strategy for our schools which sets out the policy of the Department of Education on the effective use of digital technologies and teaching learning and assessment. The key action under the strategy is the promotion of the responsible and ethical use of the Internet and related technologies. That all feeds into practice within our schools.	spk_184
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Online Safety	dbsect_25	I appreciate the Deputy’s interest in this area and indeed her shining a light on it. It behoves us to acknowledge the world in which we live today. Significant progress has been made by the Department. There is also a recognition that more needs to be done in this space and it is for that reason there is the review of the programmes we deliver. In the interim, we have made the toolkits available, and we have, as the Deputy has referred to, supports such as Webwise. We also have our PDST, which is specifically supporting our staff, the toolkits that are available online. The whole impetus for all of this is to ensure we can have respectful online communications through the development of digital literacy, as the Deputy has said, which is very important. We want our young people to have digital literacy, but also that they would be cognisant and mindful of the need for online safety and the safe and ethical use of all digital technologies, which is at the core of all we seek to achieve.	spk_186
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Abuse at Certain Educational Institutions: Statements	dbsect_30	"I welcome the opportunity to provide a statement on the deeply shocking and disturbing accounts of abuse in certain schools. I know that all in this House and right across the country will have felt the same sense of shock and revulsion at the revelations made in recent weeks about the extent of sexual abuse in Spiritan schools. I have engaged with survivors over recent days and will continue to do so over the coming days. At the outset, I commend the courage of those who have come forward and indeed all of those who have been living with the impact of this abuse for many years. Their courage has given voice to a deep hurt that is shared, I am sure, by many others who continue to suffer in silence as a consequence of similar experiences. These revelations of abuse in several schools are deeply disturbing and heartbreaking. Like the rest of the Government, I am very conscious of the enormous trauma that has been endured by all survivors of abuse. The sexual abuse of a child is repugnant to the whole of society and is a reprehensible abuse of power and trust. Parents entrust their children to the care of schools and staff, and should be confident that their children will be cared for, protected and cherished in school. The Government takes the issue of sexual abuse very seriously. These crimes are abhorrent and I am fully aware of the devastating impact they can have on the lives of people affected. As Members will appreciate, I cannot comment on a specific case, but I wish to reassure the House that there is comprehensive legislation in place to deal with these offences. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act was enacted in early 2017. It is wide-ranging legislation that significantly enhances laws to combat the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children.  I have been informed that since the broadcast of the documentary ""Blackrock Boys"" on 6 November last and as of 22 November last, 32 contacts have been received by An Garda Síochána regarding sexual abuse at six schools run by the Spiritan Education Trust: Blackrock College, Willow Park, Rockwell College, St. Mary's College, St. Michael's College and Templeogue College. Of these contacts, I am informed 27 are from survivors, three from witnesses and two from people acting on behalf of survivors. The reports relate to alleged incidents dating from 1954 until 1991. I would like to encourage all who have been subjected to or witnessed clerical sexual abuse to contact An Garda Síochána. The sexual crime management unit at the Garda National Protective Services Bureau, GNPSB, is the central point of contact for all reports of clerical sexual abuse. A dedicated email address has been set up to support the reporting of such crimes. People who wish to report such crimes can also contact their local Garda station, the sexual crime management unit, at 01 6663430, or the Garda child sexual abuse reporting line, at 1800 555 222. This is a confidential and free service available to the public on a 24-7 basis. It is vital that survivors of child sexual abuse have the opportunity to be heard in full and with appropriate respect and sensitivity. They need to know there will be a serious response from the Government. Right across the House, I know we are united in calling for a survivor-led response. My urgent priority in recent days was to listen to survivors and this will also be the case in the coming days. This is to allow them to share their experiences with me personally should they so wish and for me to begin to get a sense of what they would like to see happen. I would like to express my sincere thanks to those survivors who have engaged with me to date and have done so in the spirit of openly sharing their experiences. They are telling me what they would like to see happen. As I hear a different perspective from each individual, I hope a thread of commonality in terms of an approach or approaches will come through so I can work further with the Government, all in this House and primarily with survivors to arrive at a consensus on the most appropriate way forward. I acknowledge the calls for an inquiry. I am cognisant that the Government owes it to the survivors to ensure any process of inquiry is the right one and will best deliver the outcomes they feel are most important. To ensure any such response will indeed be effective and survivor led, it is important at this stage to consider carefully the range of options open to achieve these outcomes while acknowledging and analysing the strengths and challenges inherent in any single approach. Every survivor who has spoken with me has told of how they have entered into this stage or entered in the past into engagement with the order or with gardaí, or taken other legal avenues, and felt entirely unsupported. They have said how difficult that has been for them. There is no doubt but that a significant body of work lies ahead. The next steps will be important and should involve, among other initiatives and opportunities, specific opportunities to speak to survivors on an intensive basis, engaging with Government colleagues and Opposition parties on potential options, thinking about the appropriate expertise that will help us to bring all aspects together so that a coherent picture can be formed of what kind of inquiry will achieve the outcomes required and carefully analysing the learnings from previous inquiries in respect of the appalling legacy of child abuse. These inquiries have played an important role in bringing accounts of abuse to light. Most notably, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was established on a statutory basis in 2000 and published its final report, known as the Ryan report, in 2009. The Ferns, Murphy and Cloyne reports dealt with clerical abuse in dioceses. These reports helped the State to set out a clear pathway towards rectifying the system failures that had allowed a culture of abuse to flourish and have had an enormous impact and resonance for all children in Ireland. We need to consider in broad terms the response of the order in terms of restorative justice, the provision of supports, how complainants are treated and supported and whether standards are being met in terms of accountability within the order. Further discussion and engagement will take place with survivors, the Government and the Opposition, child welfare experts and others to determine the final shape of any proposals. I will return shortly to the Government with proposals in this respect. I want to take a moment to reflect on the children in our society today. While we should never be complacent, I want to reassure parents that a robust child protection system is now in place in our primary and post-primary schools. This includes enhanced mechanisms in respect of detection and reporting, including mandatory reporting of child protection concerns, vetting and greater overall awareness. These procedures have been developed in alignment with overarching national policy which is being led by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability Integration and Youth and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will give a comprehensive picture of that national policy which has impact for the benefit of all children and their presence in all sectors, including the education sector. The Children First Act 2015 seeks to raise awareness of child abuse and neglect, provides for mandatory reporting by key professionals and improves child safeguarding arrangements in organisations providing services to children. My Department's child protection procedures for primary and post-primary schools, which were issued in 2017, provide guidance to schools on their responsibilities under the Children First Act 2015 and the Children First national guidance 2017. These procedures provide necessary information to school authorities and personnel to help them to be alert and aware of what to do in situations where there is a concern, suspicion or allegation that a child may have been abused or neglected, is being abused or neglected or is at risk of abuse or neglect. In all cases, the most important consideration to be taken into account is the protection of children and young people. The procedures require that in any situation where a member of school personnel receives an allegation or has a suspicion that a child may have been abused or neglected, is being abused or neglected or is at risk of being abused or neglected, he or she shall, without delay, report the matter to a designated liaison person. The designated liaison person is responsible for ensuring that any reasonable grounds for concern are reported to Tusla. It is not necessary for the designated liaison person to prove that abuse has occurred in order to report a concern. All that is required is that there are reasonable grounds for concern. The Department's inspectorate monitors compliance with the child protection procedures for primary and post-primary schools 2017 during all school inspections. The inspectorate's monitoring work in this regard is one of a range of quality assurance and oversight measures to ensure that schools and their staff are operating in compliance with the Children First Act 2015. In addition, any concerns of a child protection nature received by staff in my Department are dealt with in accordance with the Department's procedures for responding to child protection concerns which come to the attention of staff employed by the Department of Education. Under these procedures, the Department ensures that the details of any concern reported to the Department are immediately transmitted to Tusla for assessment. On foot of the launch of the updated child protection procedures for primary and post-primary schools in 2017, the Department of Education has funded the delivery of continuing professional development, CPD, support and training for teachers, school leaders and staff to outline the statutory obligations that apply to organisations such as schools under the Children First Act. The CPD also provides guidance and directions to school leaders and teachers in regard to meeting their new statutory obligations under the Act. The Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, also has a role in providing in-school support for schools who require additional guidance. Personal safety skills are part of the safety and protection strand unit within the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum of all primary schools. The Stay Safe programme is a mandatory personal safety skills programme for primary schools, both mainstream and special. Its overall objective is to prevent child abuse, bullying and other forms of victimisation. CPD training for teachers has been provided by PDST advisers and associates. My Department also provides for online safety in schools through a range of programmes, including formal curriculum content, teacher professional development, strategies around well-being and bullying, and the use of innovative materials. An Internet safety initiative is a key educational resource on online safety issues and promotes the autonomous, effective and safe use of the Internet by young people. On a broader level, online safety and the safe and ethical use of digital technology is a key component of the Department's digital strategy for schools. Throughout the implementation of the strategy,  These measures highlight the importance this Government, and other recent governments, have placed on child protection. This does not, however, lessen in any way the trauma and experience of survivors of sexual abuse. The recent revelations of abuse in certain schools are repulsive and shocking. These appalling acts merit a serious response and my Government colleagues are working to ensure such a response will be provided."	spk_278
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-24	dail	33	Abuse at Certain Educational Institutions: Statements	dbsect_30	I acknowledge and express my thanks to colleagues for their contributions on this important issue. It is absolutely clear and it is equally unambiguous that this House considers the recent shocking revelations of abuse in certain schools to be deeply disturbing, and that the House is of the view that a strong and considerate response is required with the view of the survivors being absolutely central to that response. I look forward to engaging further with Opposition colleagues next week on this issue. I am confident that this engagement will help to ensure the State's response to this issue is appropriate and effective. It is important that it would be effective. My primary focus at this time is to listen to survivors, to listen to their experiences and to hear their views, their opinions, their thoughts and their vision of how we should proceed. I have met with a number survivors in recent days, and this will continue in the coming days so that I can hear from them at first hand. Ultimately, this will inform the path forward that the Government will pursue. The experiences we have heard in recent weeks are deeply disturbing and heartbreaking. It is clear that the individuals who have come forward to tell of their experiences have been deeply affected and traumatised by their experiences, as have all survivors of abuse and indeed their families. This point is made consistently to me by survivors regarding the impact it had on them as individuals but also on their families. I reiterate that sexual abuse of a child is abhorrent and is absolutely and truly an abuse of trust and power. With regard to where we stand presently in our schools, I confirm that there is a robust system of child protection in place in our schools. This system includes enhanced mechanisms for detection and reporting; mandatory reporting of child protection concerns, which is such a positive and important feature of child protection measures in schools; vetting; and greater overall awareness of better child protection. While we can never be complacent, it is clearly the case that the highest priority is being given to child protection in our schools. The system for child protection is underpinned by the Children First Act 2015, which is there to provide for the mandatory reporting of child protection concerns by key professionals, including school staff and management, and to improve the arrangements for child safeguarding in organisations that provide services to children, including schools. To support schools in meeting their responsibilities, the Department of Education has in place child protection procedures for primary and post-primary schools. Compliance with those procedures is overseen by the Department's inspectorate. It is of utmost importance that survivors of child sex abuse will know that there will be a serious and significant response across the Government to this issue. I have already begun engaging with Government colleagues in this regard. The Government is currently considering the most appropriate and effective ways to progress this matter. I look forward to the engagement that the Opposition and colleagues here in this House will provide as part of that engagement. It is crucial to ensure that any process of inquiry will result in an outcome that is sought by survivors. To ensure this, we will continue to engage with them. It is clear also that different individuals have different perspectives but it is my hope that with consistent and open engagement with survivors, and with colleagues, we will find an approach that will meet the needs, the demands and the visions of all involved. I appreciate that it has already been pointed out in this House - and I have also referred to this - that we can learn from the strengths and challenges of previous inquiries that played an important role in highlighting the appalling legacy of child abuse in this country. It is also crucial that any steps taken by the Government, in consultation with survivors, do not in any way impact negatively on the ongoing or future investigations by An Garda Síochána. Sexual abuse is a criminal act and it is of the utmost importance that any crimes that have been committed are fully and effectively investigated by An Garda Síochána and the perpetrators of such heinous crimes are held to account. From listening to survivors over recent days, I am aware that very few have thus far had the opportunity to see their abuser face justice. I am equally conscious that it is critical we do nothing to jeopardise any future remaining opportunities to do so. I have been assured that those coming forward with allegations will be treated with the utmost sensitivity by An Garda Síochána. Again, therefore, I urge anyone who has experienced abuse to consider coming forward using the contact details I mentioned earlier in order that action can be taken to hold those responsible for these terrible crimes fully accountable. The appalling acts perpetrated against children and young people merit and need a significant and strong response from the Government. I confirm to the House again that the Government is absolutely determined that such a response will be provided.	spk_297
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-11-08	dail	33	Sports Facilities	dbsect_28	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline for the House the position with regard to the amalgamation of St Vincent's Secondary School and North Presentation Secondary School in Cork. St. Vincent's Secondary School is a post-primary school for girls under the patronage of the Religious Sisters of Charity. It had 215 students in the 2021-2022 school year. North Presentation Secondary School is also a post-primary school for girls and is under the patronage of CEIST. It had an enrolment of 138 students in the 2021-2022 school year. The Department has received correspondence from the patrons of both schools regarding their proposed amalgamation and a change of status of the new amalgamated school to co-educational. The decision-making authorities for any amalgamation or change of status are the patrons of the schools.

As he is aware, the State Examinations Commission, SEC, has statutory responsibility for the operation of the State exams. It has a responsibility to candidates to ensure their work is marked to the highest standards of quality and integrity. I appreciate that many students are frustrated that they have not yet received their examination results, and I have been assured by the SEC that it is seeking to issue results in the earliest timeframe possible. This year is the first time since 2019 that all candidates sat the written examinations, which is a very welcome development. As in any year, priority this year was given to the leaving certificate and these results issued on 2 September. The next priority has been processing the leaving certificate appeals, and these results issued on Friday. It was essential to prioritise the leaving certificate and leaving certificate appeals results, given that they have a direct impact on access to further and higher education as well as the world of work. Further to a 2019 court judgment on the matter of appeals results, the SEC has altered the sequence in which it issues results, with leaving certificate appeal results being issued to the Central Applications Office, CAO, in time for integration with the CAO offers season. It is also worth noting that this year overall there was an 11% increase in the number of appeals relative to 2019. The next priority is the junior cycle results and this process is well advanced but ongoing. Marking in almost all junior cycle subjects has been completed. However, in a small number of subjects in which examiner supply challenges were most severe during the summer months, the marking process is ongoing. For that reason the SEC has advised it is not possible to confirm a date at this point. These examiner supply challenges have been particularly acute for junior cycle, and in most subjects the number of examiners was significantly fewer than the number required to mark the subject during the normal summer window. At the same time, the number sitting State examinations, including junior cycle, continues to rise year on year. It is also important to recognise that the examiner challenge was one of a number of issues this year which meant results of the examinations are later than they would be in a normal year. A deferred leaving certificate sitting was held for candidates who may have suffered bereavement or illness, including Covid-19.  Every effort will be made by the SEC to issue junior cycle results as soon as possible.	spk_273

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	I thank the Deputy. The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of my Department. In the last school year more than 121,400 children, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The cost of the scheme in 2021 was €289 million. I recognise the importance of the school transport service for families and children. The review commenced in February 2021. It is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs and the primary and post-primary school transport schemes to include an examination of eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the scheme's objectives.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting, where possible, initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school.  In June 2021, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report. Following consideration of this report, I approved temporary alleviation measures which allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school, had applied by the 29 April and registered for a ticket by the 29 July. Temporary alleviation measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022-23 school year.  Wider considerations relating to the operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review. The technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation over the last number of months, including running a public survey for parents, guardians and students, and has consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments. The steering group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.  While work on the review is impacted somewhat by challenges including the pandemic and the impact on resources arising from the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the completion of the final phase of the review will be in the shortest timeframe possible. I will examine and consider the final recommendations once received.	spk_279
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	The purpose of the review is to look at all aspects of the current system and that includes examining eligibility criteria, trends, cost drivers and the overall effectiveness of the scheme in meeting the objectives as set out. The objective is to maximise the opportunities for young people to avail of the service. To answer the Deputy's first question, eligibility will most certainly be part of it, which is welcome. He is correct that the value of the school transport system is incalculable, particularly in certain areas where it is a vital service. It is our objective that we will maximise the opportunity for people to avail of it. That is very much part of the review.  It is an important provision for students with special education needs, SEN. More than 17,000 SEN students avail of it. We will examine all aspects of its appropriateness and effectiveness for students with special education needs.	spk_281
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	I appreciate the points that the Deputies made. Nobody appreciates more than myself the importance of the school transport scheme and the shortcomings that exist. It is for that reason that I launched this comprehensive review of the scheme, which is long overdue because there are shortcomings and I know how vital it is to those who avail of it. Eligibility, distance and all of that is part of the review and the ongoing work. Deputy Moynihan specifically referred to the 3.2 km and the 4.8 km criteria. Every aspect of eligibility is being looked at. The Deputy will be aware of issues around concessionaires and who is a concessionary. I believe a lot of that will be addressed in considering the new criteria.	spk_286
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	As the Deputy will be aware, I announced an ambitious programme of work for a reimagined senior cycle of education where the student is at the centre of their senior cycle experience. There are three clear objective. It will empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century; enrich the student experience and build on what’s strong in our current system; and embed well-being and reduce student stress levels. Considerable work has been ongoing regarding senior cycle redevelopment in the Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA and the SEC, in particular since the March announcement. Officials in the Department have engaged with key stakeholders on senior cycle redevelopment including providing a number of online information sessions to parents. Subject background papers have been prepared for the two new subjects of drama, film and theatre studies and climate action and sustainable development; as well as for business. The NCCA has a public consultation under way in respect of those subjects which closes at the end of October. The subject development groups within the NCCA, through which the new and revised curriculums will be developed, have been convened and the first meetings have been held. I have asked the SEC to undertake an evaluation of the 2022 experience of holding oral and music practical examinations at Easter so as to inform our approach in subsequent years. The NCCA and the SEC are in the process of commissioning research in relation to the weighting, composition and moderation of teacher-based assessment components.  Our next immediate steps include preparing to launch the process through which schools will be invited to become network schools. Those schools will support the introduction of the new and revised subjects in fifth year in September 2024. The planning necessary to hold paper 1 in Irish and English at the end of the fifth year from summer 2023 has also commenced. In addition, from the start of the current school year students pursuing the leaving certificate applied, LCA programme have been able to access maths from the established programme and those pursuing the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, programme are no longer required to satisfy subject specific criteria to be eligible for the programme. These are the first steps that will ultimately lead to a more integrated leaving certificate available to all students. Work has also commenced within the NCCA’s structures in regard to the production of a revised transition year programme statement and the development of L1 and L2 learning programmes to provide for continuity from equivalent level programmes at junior cycle level.	spk_289
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	I have been very clear about the need for the reform of senior cycle and I have outlined the aspects on which we have already moved. We have already made considerable changes on foot of the announcements for senior cycle. For example, the students availing of the LCA programme may now avail of maths from the established programme. There is a crossover between the different programmes available at leaving certificate. Equally, students who wish to study the LCV programme are no longer prohibited on the basis of the subjects they choose; it is open to everyone. We have also said that there will be a revised transition year programme. We are currently developing a structure where the L1 and L2 programmes, which are available to children with special educational needs, will be also available at senior cycle. We have been very clear that there will be 40% teacher-based assessment. We have been also very clear that all this will be worked through in what we are calling our network schools so that the students and teachers are co-authors of the programme. We have been also very clear that students will not need to experience any single day in June where all their marks are dependent on their performance on that day. We have also made clear that as part of the syllabus, there will be various methods of adjudicating students' abilities, whether it is oral presentations-----	spk_291
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	The Deputy is misconstruing what I said to him. I said there is absolute clarity on the broad thrust of what is to be achieved at senior cycle. I have been very clear about the new types of subjects that will be available. Two specific new subjects will be available: drama, film and theatre studies; and climate action and sustainable development. The work on that has already begun. The Deputy spoke about clarity for students and teachers. I have been also very clear that the entire process, particularly as it relates to assessment etc., will be worked through our network schools. That will involve teachers and students. There will be total engagement there. It will be a co-authoring of the process. We will shortly be commencing opportunities for schools to join that network schools programme. We have already begun the process of senior cycle reform. This year for the first time, students will be allowed to move between the leaving certificate established and leaving certificate applied. That reflects one of the broadest ambitions in ensuring there is a crossover. Another measure from senior cycle reform in our schools this year is ensuring that the LCV programme is open to all students. The process has begun and there will be ongoing consultation with students and staff.	spk_294
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	As the Deputy is aware, in June of this year, I visited the Cork Life Centre and I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to meet some of the young people who attend the centre, together with their parents and guardians, as well as members of staff and the management of the centre. During the meeting, the centre raised the issues of security of employment for its staff and their terms and conditions, including payment rates for the centre's teaching staff. Staff employed in Cork Life Centre, under the co-operation hours arrangements by Cork Education and Training Board, are employed under terms and conditions, including pay scales, in line with arrangements which apply to settings outside the recognised school system. It is not unusual that tutors may hold qualifications that entitle them to recognised teacher status or registration with the Teaching Council, but payment rates and terms and conditions are generally dependent on the setting or sector in which a person is employed. A commitment was given to examine the circumstances around the payment of teachers at Cork Life Centre. I am committed to honouring that agreement through the review of out-of-school education provision. With the report completed, work has now commenced on the next phase of this process. I am very keen to see progress made on the implementation of the recommendations of the report. In the interim, the level of funding currently provided to Cork Life Centre will continue until such time as the recommendations of the report are implemented. This funding will be in place and will provide ongoing support for the centre. The Department of Education has provided funding to Cork Life Centre in recent years, with that support increasing significantly since 2018. In 2022, my Department will provide funding of €177,500. This is in addition to the 6,000 co-operation hours, funded by my Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. I also give a commitment that my Department will continue to engage with Cork Life Centre to work towards a framework for sustainability for the centre. Indeed, this is what the review of out-of-school education provision aims to provide for the sector as a whole, including Cork Life Centre. The body of work to advance the implementation of the recommendations is now under way and will be completed as soon as possible. It is envisioned that the implementation of the recommendations of the review will address all of the issues raised by Cork Life Centre.	spk_302

However, as I have made very clear, I have met with the centre and I am very conscious of the work it does. The issues the centre has raised will be addressed via the review of the out-of-school education provision. In the interim, to be clear, the Department has provided significant funding to Cork Life Centre in recent years and, in 2022 alone, significant funding of €177,500 was provided. That is in addition to the 6,000 co-operation hours funded by the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.

I fully understand that no one setting suits the needs of students and we must provide a variety of settings for them. It is the desire of the Cork Life Centre, and all such centres, that it would have a sustainable future. It is for that reason we are determined to ensure via the review that we have a mechanism that will protect and sustain the sector as a whole, including the Cork Life Centre.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	On 1 January 2021, responsibility for education welfare functions, including the administration of the home school community liaison scheme and the school completion programme, SCP, transferred from the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to me. The SCP forms part of the Tusla education support service, TESS. While the arrangements between Tusla and the SCP are not impacted by the change in ministerial responsibility, Tusla now reports to my Department in respect of the SCP, which is funded by my Department via Tusla. TESS has three strands. These are the statutory educational welfare service, EWS, and the two school support services, namely, the home school community liaison, HSCL, scheme and the SCP. The three TESS strands work together collaboratively with schools, families and other relevant services to achieve the best educational outcomes for children and young people. The SCP was introduced in 2002 by my Department and the programme is now a central element of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, my Department’s main policy initiative to address educational disadvantage at school level. The SCP delivers a range of local interventions in disadvantaged communities that support the retention of young people in education. The programme enables local communities to develop tailored strategies to maximise the participation levels of those at risk of early school-leaving in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. There are currently 122 school completion projects with local management committees. The 2022 allocation for the programme is €26.9 million and additional funding will be provided later this year to allow new DEIS urban primary and post-primary schools to access the SCP service. At present, management of the school completion programme initiatives, including the employment of staff, occurs at local level.  Since I took over responsibility for the school completion programme in January 2021, I have secured additional funding to provide for an extension of SCP supports to 28 additional schools that were included in DEIS for the first time in September 2017 and a 5% overall increase in funding for the school completion programme, effective from September 2021. In addition, I negotiated a further increase of 5% for the SCP under budget 2023.	spk_311
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	To be clear, I appreciate and acknowledge the value of the school completion programme and see the work it does on the ground. We are looking at an holistic approach between school completion, home school community liaison and so on to ensure students and young people at risk of early school-leaving will be supported insofar as possible to maintain their presence in school and to succeed. I reiterate that the initial focus of the transfer of the school completion programme has been very much on the development of the legislative platform to support the transfer of functions from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the process in that respect was recently completed. My Department will, as the Deputy noted, consider all aspects of the development of the programme, including its management and all aspects involved therein. I will keep the Deputy updated on the matter. I am determined, now that we have completed the legislative framework, to consider all other aspects.	spk_313
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	I very much appreciate the Deputy's points and am conscious of the disparity that exists.

I wanted to be fair and honest in saying there had to be considerable work in that respect from a legislative point of view but I am aware of the differences of approach and of impact in terms of staffing throughout the country. The next body of work, focusing on all other aspects of the management of the SCP now that we have jumped the first significant hurdle, will commence imminently.	spk_315
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	As the Deputy is aware, the school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. It is important to look at the figures. In the most recent school year, more than 121,400 children, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The cost of the scheme in 2021 was €289 million. It is an important service for families and children. The purpose of the scheme, having regard to available resources, is to support the transport to and from school of children who reside at a remote distance from their nearest school. In July 2022, the Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2022-23 school year as part of a wider package of cost-of-living measures. School transport ticket registration for the current school year closed on 29 July, by which time almost 130,000 applications were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applicants as well as rollovers from the previous school year. More than 125,000 tickets have already issued for the 2022-23 school year. At the start of the previous school year, approximately 103,600 children were carried on mainstream school transport services. This means in the region of 21,400 additional places have been created, which is a 20% overall increase. Compared with the start of the 2021-22 school year, there has been an increase of 18% to date in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils and an increase of 27% in the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils. Bus Éireann will continue to process applications and issue tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service. Regrettably, however, the unprecedented numbers of new applications for the current school year have led to some delays in the issuing of tickets. The normal eligibility criteria for the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with those criteria. Pupils at primary level are eligible if they live no less than 3.2 km from, and are attending, their nearest primary school. At post-primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 km from their nearest or next nearest school are eligible.	spk_339
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	I acknowledge the Deputy's ongoing commitment to this issue. The scheme for the waiving of school transport fees was very clear in that it applied to those students who met the eligibility criteria. We have outlined those criteria, which are that pupils must live more than 3.2 km from their nearest primary school or 4.8 km from their nearest post-primary school or, to include the temporary alleviation measures I introduced, their next nearest school. Those who have met those criteria are being catered for. The difficulties we have identified concern pupils who had concessionary tickets last year. We received additional funding in the budget to ensure those who were in receipt of concessionary tickets last year and had applied on time would, where capacity allows, be accommodated. However, I absolutely acknowledge the whole impetus behind the review of the school transport system is to look at the issue of eligibility and the criteria and, as I said earlier, to maximise the potential to have a greater number of students availing of the scheme.	spk_341
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	I thank the Deputy. I reiterate that we have seen an increase this year in the numbers who are eligible. We have also seen a 27% increase in the number of concessionary tickets offered this year compared with last year. It is a substantial increase. Notwithstanding that, the entire root-and-branch review will give us an opportunity to look at new opportunities into the future for enhancing and increasing eligibility and meeting the demand that exists.	spk_343
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 143 together. I do not have the full reply as I did not think we would get to these questions. I apologise to the Deputy for that and will provide her with the updated data. I take the opportunity to say the work NEPS does is absolutely invaluable, as the Deputy will appreciate. We have increased the number of staff in the service in recent years, including provision in the recent budget for the recruitment of an additional 54 psychologists. That recruitment process will begin in November. Even as late as the past few days and weeks, we have seen the importance of the work NEPS does locally and its value to schools. I will ensure the Deputy gets the specific data she has requested. I can give the positive message that we are consistently increasing the number of NEPS psychologists in post locally. I welcome the provision in the budget for an additional 54 to be provided. In recognition of the importance of their work, that recruitment process will begin as a matter of priority and it is my expectation it will happen next month, with a view to continuing to maximise the provision. Over the past two years, we have looked at consistently increasing the numbers. An additional 54 psychologists this year is what is provided for in the budget and recruitment will begin in the coming weeks. I will ensure the Deputy gets the outstanding data she is seeking.	spk_346
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	I appreciate having the opportunity to confirm the Department has set up a high-level working group on this issue chaired by the Secretary General, which is a testament to the importance we are placing on how we advance the service provided by NEPS. The working group has agreed on a number of actions that will be taken. Following analysis of the various options that were laid out by the group, it has been decided the Department will use some available NEPS funding to sponsor a cohort of third-year students of the educational psychology doctoral programme in University College Dublin, UCD, and Mary Immaculate College, which is linked to the University of Limerick, for the academic year 2022-23 by providing a contribution towards their fees and associated expenses.The workforce planning group that I referenced previously, under the Secretary General, will be asked to make some interim recommendations in quarter 2 of next year regarding any other short-term measures required in advance of the final report. I want to acknowledge that we are making considerable progress in this area. I think that is a positive announcement.	spk_348
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	I do not disagree with the value and importance of the work, as I have said. I think it is a positive that we can say that the high level working group, which is chaired by the Secretary General, underlining the importance that we in the Department place upon it, is looking at a whole variety of opportunities going forward. Among those is the decision that has been taken to sponsor a cohort of third year students for the 2022-2023 academic year by providing a contribution to their fees and associated expenses. Given the particular time pressures for students in the third year of the programme, interviews will be held in the coming months to provide financial support to those students currently on training placements in NEPS who are due to complete their doctoral training programme in 2023. Details will be announced in the coming weeks.	spk_350
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	As the Deputy is aware, the single biggest expansion of the DEIS programme was announced by me recently, with an investment of €17 million, increasing to €32 million next year. We are very conscious of the benefit of the DEIS programme. All analysis and studies on the programme show that it makes a considerable impact in our schools. We have grown it to such an extent that one in four of our students benefits from the DEIS programme. In terms of the review process, more than 300 schools were announced as benefiting from the DEIS programme. Schools that were not successful on this occasion were given the opportunity to appeal the findings of the programme. The schools have been notified of their status on foot of that. The entire funding allocation for the programme for 2023 will be in the region of €180 million. Consequently, because of the recent enhancement, schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage have now been identified for inclusion in the programme through the new refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics-based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. The model uses information from the school’s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP deprivation index. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on 	spk_352

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_17	I appreciate the Deputy's point that one school in an area may be awarded DEIS status and another may not. However, because it is about concentrated disadvantage, that will be the case unless the other school absolutely mirrors the school that is awarded DEIS status in terms of the entire student population. Again, I reiterate that a detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie. I also recognise that there is a need to target resources at those schools that need them most. The next phase of work, which I am undertaking now, will explore the allocation of resources to all schools to tackle educational disadvantage. This will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders. We will seek to build on many of the positive initiatives from budget 2023, including the €50 million investment providing free books to primary schools, the reduction in class sizes for all schools and all the other initiatives that have been made available in the budget.	spk_356
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy. The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of my Department. In the last school year more than 121,400 children, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The cost of the scheme in 2021 was €289 million. I recognise the importance of the school transport service for families and children. The review commenced in February 2021. It is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs and the primary and post-primary school transport schemes to include an examination of eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the scheme's objectives.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting, where possible, initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school.  In June 2021, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report. Following consideration of this report, I approved temporary alleviation measures which allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school, had applied by the 29 April and registered for a ticket by the 29 July. Temporary alleviation measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022-23 school year.  Wider considerations relating to the operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review. The technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation over the last number of months, including running a public survey for parents, guardians and students, and has consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments. The steering group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.  While work on the review is impacted somewhat by challenges including the pandemic and the impact on resources arising from the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the completion of the final phase of the review will be in the shortest timeframe possible. I will examine and consider the final recommendations once received.	spk_279
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	The purpose of the review is to look at all aspects of the current system and that includes examining eligibility criteria, trends, cost drivers and the overall effectiveness of the scheme in meeting the objectives as set out. The objective is to maximise the opportunities for young people to avail of the service. To answer the Deputy's first question, eligibility will most certainly be part of it, which is welcome. He is correct that the value of the school transport system is incalculable, particularly in certain areas where it is a vital service. It is our objective that we will maximise the opportunity for people to avail of it. That is very much part of the review.  It is an important provision for students with special education needs, SEN. More than 17,000 SEN students avail of it. We will examine all aspects of its appropriateness and effectiveness for students with special education needs.	spk_281
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	I appreciate the points that the Deputies made. Nobody appreciates more than myself the importance of the school transport scheme and the shortcomings that exist. It is for that reason that I launched this comprehensive review of the scheme, which is long overdue because there are shortcomings and I know how vital it is to those who avail of it. Eligibility, distance and all of that is part of the review and the ongoing work. Deputy Moynihan specifically referred to the 3.2 km and the 4.8 km criteria. Every aspect of eligibility is being looked at. The Deputy will be aware of issues around concessionaires and who is a concessionary. I believe a lot of that will be addressed in considering the new criteria.	spk_286
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	School Curriculum	dbsect_19	As the Deputy will be aware, I announced an ambitious programme of work for a reimagined senior cycle of education where the student is at the centre of their senior cycle experience. There are three clear objective. It will empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century; enrich the student experience and build on what’s strong in our current system; and embed well-being and reduce student stress levels. Considerable work has been ongoing regarding senior cycle redevelopment in the Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA and the SEC, in particular since the March announcement. Officials in the Department have engaged with key stakeholders on senior cycle redevelopment including providing a number of online information sessions to parents. Subject background papers have been prepared for the two new subjects of drama, film and theatre studies and climate action and sustainable development; as well as for business. The NCCA has a public consultation under way in respect of those subjects which closes at the end of October. The subject development groups within the NCCA, through which the new and revised curriculums will be developed, have been convened and the first meetings have been held. I have asked the SEC to undertake an evaluation of the 2022 experience of holding oral and music practical examinations at Easter so as to inform our approach in subsequent years. The NCCA and the SEC are in the process of commissioning research in relation to the weighting, composition and moderation of teacher-based assessment components.  Our next immediate steps include preparing to launch the process through which schools will be invited to become network schools. Those schools will support the introduction of the new and revised subjects in fifth year in September 2024. The planning necessary to hold paper 1 in Irish and English at the end of the fifth year from summer 2023 has also commenced. In addition, from the start of the current school year students pursuing the leaving certificate applied, LCA programme have been able to access maths from the established programme and those pursuing the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, programme are no longer required to satisfy subject specific criteria to be eligible for the programme. These are the first steps that will ultimately lead to a more integrated leaving certificate available to all students. Work has also commenced within the NCCA’s structures in regard to the production of a revised transition year programme statement and the development of L1 and L2 learning programmes to provide for continuity from equivalent level programmes at junior cycle level.	spk_289
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	School Curriculum	dbsect_19	I have been very clear about the need for the reform of senior cycle and I have outlined the aspects on which we have already moved. We have already made considerable changes on foot of the announcements for senior cycle. For example, the students availing of the LCA programme may now avail of maths from the established programme. There is a crossover between the different programmes available at leaving certificate. Equally, students who wish to study the LCV programme are no longer prohibited on the basis of the subjects they choose; it is open to everyone. We have also said that there will be a revised transition year programme. We are currently developing a structure where the L1 and L2 programmes, which are available to children with special educational needs, will be also available at senior cycle. We have been very clear that there will be 40% teacher-based assessment. We have been also very clear that all this will be worked through in what we are calling our network schools so that the students and teachers are co-authors of the programme. We have been also very clear that students will not need to experience any single day in June where all their marks are dependent on their performance on that day. We have also made clear that as part of the syllabus, there will be various methods of adjudicating students' abilities, whether it is oral presentations-----	spk_291
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	School Curriculum	dbsect_19	The Deputy is misconstruing what I said to him. I said there is absolute clarity on the broad thrust of what is to be achieved at senior cycle. I have been very clear about the new types of subjects that will be available. Two specific new subjects will be available: drama, film and theatre studies; and climate action and sustainable development. The work on that has already begun. The Deputy spoke about clarity for students and teachers. I have been also very clear that the entire process, particularly as it relates to assessment etc., will be worked through our network schools. That will involve teachers and students. There will be total engagement there. It will be a co-authoring of the process. We will shortly be commencing opportunities for schools to join that network schools programme. We have already begun the process of senior cycle reform. This year for the first time, students will be allowed to move between the leaving certificate established and leaving certificate applied. That reflects one of the broadest ambitions in ensuring there is a crossover. Another measure from senior cycle reform in our schools this year is ensuring that the LCV programme is open to all students. The process has begun and there will be ongoing consultation with students and staff.	spk_294
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Education Schemes	dbsect_21	As the Deputy is aware, in June of this year, I visited the Cork Life Centre and I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to meet some of the young people who attend the centre, together with their parents and guardians, as well as members of staff and the management of the centre. During the meeting, the centre raised the issues of security of employment for its staff and their terms and conditions, including payment rates for the centre's teaching staff. Staff employed in Cork Life Centre, under the co-operation hours arrangements by Cork Education and Training Board, are employed under terms and conditions, including pay scales, in line with arrangements which apply to settings outside the recognised school system. It is not unusual that tutors may hold qualifications that entitle them to recognised teacher status or registration with the Teaching Council, but payment rates and terms and conditions are generally dependent on the setting or sector in which a person is employed. A commitment was given to examine the circumstances around the payment of teachers at Cork Life Centre. I am committed to honouring that agreement through the review of out-of-school education provision. With the report completed, work has now commenced on the next phase of this process. I am very keen to see progress made on the implementation of the recommendations of the report. In the interim, the level of funding currently provided to Cork Life Centre will continue until such time as the recommendations of the report are implemented. This funding will be in place and will provide ongoing support for the centre. The Department of Education has provided funding to Cork Life Centre in recent years, with that support increasing significantly since 2018. In 2022, my Department will provide funding of €177,500. This is in addition to the 6,000 co-operation hours, funded by my Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. I also give a commitment that my Department will continue to engage with Cork Life Centre to work towards a framework for sustainability for the centre. Indeed, this is what the review of out-of-school education provision aims to provide for the sector as a whole, including Cork Life Centre. The body of work to advance the implementation of the recommendations is now under way and will be completed as soon as possible. It is envisioned that the implementation of the recommendations of the review will address all of the issues raised by Cork Life Centre.	spk_302

However, as I have made very clear, I have met with the centre and I am very conscious of the work it does. The issues the centre has raised will be addressed via the review of the out-of-school education provision. In the interim, to be clear, the Department has provided significant funding to Cork Life Centre in recent years and, in 2022 alone, significant funding of €177,500 was provided. That is in addition to the 6,000 co-operation hours funded by the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.

I fully understand that no one setting suits the needs of students and we must provide a variety of settings for them. It is the desire of the Cork Life Centre, and all such centres, that it would have a sustainable future. It is for that reason we are determined to ensure via the review that we have a mechanism that will protect and sustain the sector as a whole, including the Cork Life Centre.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Education Welfare Service	dbsect_22	On 1 January 2021, responsibility for education welfare functions, including the administration of the home school community liaison scheme and the school completion programme, SCP, transferred from the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to me. The SCP forms part of the Tusla education support service, TESS. While the arrangements between Tusla and the SCP are not impacted by the change in ministerial responsibility, Tusla now reports to my Department in respect of the SCP, which is funded by my Department via Tusla. TESS has three strands. These are the statutory educational welfare service, EWS, and the two school support services, namely, the home school community liaison, HSCL, scheme and the SCP. The three TESS strands work together collaboratively with schools, families and other relevant services to achieve the best educational outcomes for children and young people. The SCP was introduced in 2002 by my Department and the programme is now a central element of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, my Department’s main policy initiative to address educational disadvantage at school level. The SCP delivers a range of local interventions in disadvantaged communities that support the retention of young people in education. The programme enables local communities to develop tailored strategies to maximise the participation levels of those at risk of early school-leaving in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. There are currently 122 school completion projects with local management committees. The 2022 allocation for the programme is €26.9 million and additional funding will be provided later this year to allow new DEIS urban primary and post-primary schools to access the SCP service. At present, management of the school completion programme initiatives, including the employment of staff, occurs at local level.  Since I took over responsibility for the school completion programme in January 2021, I have secured additional funding to provide for an extension of SCP supports to 28 additional schools that were included in DEIS for the first time in September 2017 and a 5% overall increase in funding for the school completion programme, effective from September 2021. In addition, I negotiated a further increase of 5% for the SCP under budget 2023.	spk_311
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Education Welfare Service	dbsect_22	To be clear, I appreciate and acknowledge the value of the school completion programme and see the work it does on the ground. We are looking at an holistic approach between school completion, home school community liaison and so on to ensure students and young people at risk of early school-leaving will be supported insofar as possible to maintain their presence in school and to succeed. I reiterate that the initial focus of the transfer of the school completion programme has been very much on the development of the legislative platform to support the transfer of functions from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the process in that respect was recently completed. My Department will, as the Deputy noted, consider all aspects of the development of the programme, including its management and all aspects involved therein.

That recruitment process will begin in November. Even as late as the past few days and weeks, we have seen the importance of the work NEPS does locally and its value to schools. I will ensure the Deputy gets the specific data she has requested. I can give the positive message that we are consistently increasing the number of NEPS psychologists in post locally. I welcome the provision in the budget for an additional 54 to be provided. In recognition of the importance of their work, that recruitment process will begin as a matter of priority and it is my expectation it will happen next month, with a view to continuing to maximise the provision. Over the past two years, we have looked at consistently increasing the numbers. An additional 54 psychologists this year is what is provided for in the budget and recruitment will begin in the coming weeks. I will ensure the Deputy gets the outstanding data she is seeking.	spk_346
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	National Educational Psychological Service	dbsect_27	I appreciate having the opportunity to confirm the Department has set up a high-level working group on this issue chaired by the Secretary General, which is a testament to the importance we are placing on how we advance the service provided by NEPS. The working group has agreed on a number of actions that will be taken. Following analysis of the various options that were laid out by the group, it has been decided the Department will use some available NEPS funding to sponsor a cohort of third-year students of the educational psychology doctoral programme in University College Dublin, UCD, and Mary Immaculate College, which is linked to the University of Limerick, for the academic year 2022-23 by providing a contribution towards their fees and associated expenses.The workforce planning group that I referenced previously, under the Secretary General, will be asked to make some interim recommendations in quarter 2 of next year regarding any other short-term measures required in advance of the final report. I want to acknowledge that we are making considerable progress in this area. I think that is a positive announcement.	spk_348
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	National Educational Psychological Service	dbsect_27	I do not disagree with the value and importance of the work, as I have said. I think it is a positive that we can say that the high level working group, which is chaired by the Secretary General, underlining the importance that we in the Department place upon it, is looking at a whole variety of opportunities going forward. Among those is the decision that has been taken to sponsor a cohort of third year students for the 2022-2023 academic year by providing a contribution to their fees and associated expenses. Given the particular time pressures for students in the third year of the programme, interviews will be held in the coming months to provide financial support to those students currently on training placements in NEPS who are due to complete their doctoral training programme in 2023. Details will be announced in the coming weeks.	spk_350
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_28	As the Deputy is aware, the single biggest expansion of the DEIS programme was announced by me recently, with an investment of €17 million, increasing to €32 million next year. We are very conscious of the benefit of the DEIS programme. All analysis and studies on the programme show that it makes a considerable impact in our schools. We have grown it to such an extent that one in four of our students benefits from the DEIS programme. In terms of the review process, more than 300 schools were announced as benefiting from the DEIS programme. Schools that were not successful on this occasion were given the opportunity to appeal the findings of the programme. The schools have been notified of their status on foot of that. The entire funding allocation for the programme for 2023 will be in the region of €180 million. Consequently, because of the recent enhancement, schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage have now been identified for inclusion in the programme through the new refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics-based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. The model uses information from the school’s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP deprivation index. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on 	spk_352

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Educational Disadvantage	dbsect_28	I appreciate the Deputy's point that one school in an area may be awarded DEIS status and another may not. However, because it is about concentrated disadvantage, that will be the case unless the other school absolutely mirrors the school that is awarded DEIS status in terms of the entire student population. Again, I reiterate that a detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie. I also recognise that there is a need to target resources at those schools that need them most. The next phase of work, which I am undertaking now, will explore the allocation of resources to all schools to tackle educational disadvantage. This will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders. We will seek to build on many of the positive initiatives from budget 2023, including the €50 million investment providing free books to primary schools, the reduction in class sizes for all schools and all the other initiatives that have been made available in the budget.	spk_356
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Arts Policy	dbsect_29	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. It gives me the opportunity to set out for the House the position with regard to the delivery of school building projects under the national development plan in Dublin Mid-West. To plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system using data from a range of sources to identify where the pressure for school places throughout the country will arise. With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. Where the demographic data indicate additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through using existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools, or the provision of a new school or schools. The requirement for additional school places is kept under ongoing review. The Deputy will be aware that, following analysis of demographics and planned residential development, a new primary school was announced to serve the Clondalkin school planning area. My Department is monitoring the pace of residential development and population growth in that area with a view to determining the appropriate timing for the establishment of this new school. Under Project 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately €4.4 billion in capital investment over the period 2021 to 2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty in our ambitious plans and deliver high-quality building projects with a real focus on sustainability for school communities throughout Ireland. This investment will build on the good progress being made in adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. The investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock. The Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements in this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,300 school building projects for delivery under the Department's large-scale and additional accommodation scheme. These projects are in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. Most are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period to 2025. A list of all completed and ongoing capital projects under the large-scale and additional accommodation scheme in county order from 2010 to date may be viewed on the Department's website. As can be seen from the list on the website, a significant number of school building projects are under way or have been completed across the Dublin Mid-West area, with 30 large-scale and additional school accommodation scheme projects currently across various stages of planning and delivery. I note the Deputy referenced a school that has been waiting for additional accommodation since 2009. I have been Minister for two years. I will give the Deputy the update on my term as Minister. A large-scale project at the Clondalkin schools campus is currently at tender stage. This will provide new 16-classroom school buildings for Gaelscoil Chluain Dolcáin and Gaelscoil na Camóige, as well as enhanced facilities for Coláiste Chillian. While there have been some challenges, this joint major project is anticipated to be on site in quarter 2 of 2023, subject to planning and tendering processes, as is always the case. The Department is also delivering a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school building for Holy Family Community School, Rathcoole, which is expected to commence construction in quarter 1 of 2023. A project at Griffeen Community College, Lucan, which the Deputy mentioned, is expected to proceed to tender later this year. A project at Coláiste Pobail Fóla at Citywest is also expected to proceed to tender later this year. The Citywest campus project also includes a new 16-classroom primary school for Gaelscoil Lir. New 24-classroom primary school buildings are being provided for Scoil Áine Naofa and St. Thomas's National School, Lucan, as part of my Department's ADAPT 3 building programme, and the programme's project manager will shortly be commencing the process to appoint a design team for the project. Large-scale extensions at Divine Mercy junior and senior schools, Lucan, are currently at detailed design stage. A significant extension at St. Joseph's College, Lucan, is at construction. An extension at Lucan Community College was recently authorised to proceed to tender for the appointment of a building contractor. Recently completed projects include a new 28-classroom school for Stewarts Hospital Special School, as the Deputy referenced, and a new 16-classroom primary school for Citywest Educate Together National School and Citywest and Saggart Community National School.	spk_358
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Arts Policy	dbsect_29	I appreciate the Deputy's particular interest in all matters related to education. I acknowledge a fairly significant commitment in that there are more than 30 large-scale and additional school accommodation scheme projects currently at various stages of planning and delivery for the Dublin Mid-West area. That is a positive story to present this evening. I have taken the opportunity to reference so many of them, in particular, the Clondalkin school campus, which is at tender stage. Other projects are at various stages. The Deputy referenced many of them, including Holy Family Community School, which will be a 1,000 pupil post-primary school that is expected to commence construction in 2023. She also noted the positive news for St. Joseph's, for example, and the breaking of ground. I know how important that visual, on-the-ground progress is. We also specifically referenced the expectation of proceeding to tender for Griffeen Community College, which will take place later this year. Coláiste Pobail Fóla will also go to tender this year. The Citywest campus project the Deputy referred to is significant and is part of the ADAPT 3 building programme. The project manager has now proceeded to appoint a design team for that project. This is a significant investment by the Department and a major acknowledgement of the facilities that are required in the area, notwithstanding that schools are doing tremendous work with the facilities they currently have. We have an ambition to support them in moving forward with the facilities they might require for the future. It is comprehensive and very much an acknowledgement of the excellent work that is ongoing in the delivery of education that we are matching it with the provision of appropriate school buildings.	spk_360
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Arts Policy	dbsect_29	I thank Deputy McGrath for raising the issue. I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee. The Deputy will appreciate that under section 26 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business, which includes the allocation of Garda resources. The Minister for Justice has no statutory role in regard to these operational policing matters. The Minister is assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends to ensure their optimal use. I understand it is a matter for the divisional chief superintendent to determine the optimal distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the division. The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that An Garda Síochána has the resources it needs to perform its critical role in the community. In budget 2023 an unprecedented €2.14 billion was allocated to An Garda Síochána, representing an increase of €78 million on 2022. This includes provision for the recruitment of 1,000 new gardaí and more than 400 Garda staff. I am informed that as of 31 August 2022, there were 399 Garda members assigned to the Tipperary division. Clonmel district is comprised of five stations with 76 Garda members assigned to it. This represents an increase of more than 4% since the end of December 2019. The district is supported by 17 Garda staff assigned to Clonmel station as of the end of August this year. The Government has committed to building a new Garda station in Clonmel as part of the justice sector private-public partnership. This is being done alongside a proposed new station in Macroom, County Cork, and a family law complex at Hammond Lane, Dublin 7. Planning permission was granted for the new station in 2021. The Department continues to engage with An Garda Síochána, the Office of Public Works and the National Development Finance Agency with a view to progressing the project. The construction of the new Garda station in Clonmel is an important development for policing in the area. Once completed the station will provide a modern, fit-for-purpose facility for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with gardaí. The Deputy may be aware that the Garda Commissioner is continuing the roll-out of the new Garda operating model. The operating model is designed to make each division the central unit of policing administration rather than the current smaller district model and will provide more front-line gardaí, increased Garda visibility and a wider range of policing services for local areas.In the period 2017 to 31 August 2022, 875.5 Garda members were reassigned to operational roles under the Garda reassignment initiative, and a further 306 posts were identified as suitable for civilianisation and redeployment in line with the programme for Government commitment to boost the redeployment of Garda members from non-core duties to front-line duties for the benefit of communities across the country, including that of Clonmel. The Minister is conscious of the particular crime concerns facing rural communities. The publication just last month of Rural Safety Plan 2022–2024 by the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, seeks to address these and provide support information to rural communities. The plan is available at 	spk_366
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Arts Policy	dbsect_29	Again, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. The Minister would like to reassure him that Garda numbers have increased substantially in recent years, from 12,943 Garda members and 1,999 Garda staff in 2016 to 14,283 Garda members and 3,117 Garda staff at the end of August this year. This is an increase in gardaí of more than 10%. There has been an almost 56% increase in Garda staff in recent years. The Government has made an ongoing and firm commitment to support An Garda Síochána financially and provide it with the resources it needs to support more visible policing. This method will ensure that communities such as Clonmel are safe and that the people in them feel safe. However, I emphasise that, as recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, responsibility for community safety does not rest solely with an Garda or the Department of Justice. It is a whole-of-government responsibility. This principle is the cornerstone of the Government's policy on community safety and, significantly, will be provided for in law by the new policing security and community safety Bill. Under the legislation, when drafted, new, broader local community-safety partnerships will bring all services in the community together at local authority level, replacing the existing joint policing committees to serve as a comprehensive forum for discussion and decisions on community priorities. Three partnerships are currently being piloted and their operational experiences will feed into nationwide policy roll-out following the conclusion of the pilot period at the end of 2023. I will relay to the Minister for Justice the points the Deputy has raised but I reiterate that, since 31 August 2022, there have been 399 Garda members assigned to County Tipperary. Clonmel district is comprised of five stations with 76 Garda members assigned to it. This represents an increase of more than 4% since end December 2019. The district has been supported by 17 Garda staff, assigned to Clonmel station at the end August this year. I will bring the points the Deputy has raised to the attention of the Minister for Justice. That is the update I have received.	spk_368
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Arts Policy	dbsect_29	As the Deputy will be aware, I am presenting this information on behalf of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin. Primary support for the arts is delivered by the Arts Council. In 2022, the Minister allocated a record €130 million to the Arts Council. She was pleased to retain the €130 million in funding for the council in 2023 in recognition of the transformational impact that funding has had on the development of the sector, enabling the council to support more artists and arts organisations than ever before.The council is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003 and the Minister or officials in her Department cannot intervene in this decision-making. Recent decades have seen the development of a nationwide infrastructure of venues and arts centres, many of which were initiated and funded by local authorities. Current funding provided to these arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council is critical to ensure that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained. Local authorities are central to the support and development of the arts in Ireland through their own arts offices and through the resourcing and funding of arts centres.  In the context outlined it is understood that the council has made a number of funding awards to the arts centre referred to by the Deputy. This includes €210,000 of arts centre funding as well as commissions awards under its programme for young people children and education. I also understand that Carlow County Council has been awarded €100,000 by the council under the long-standing local arts partnership funding scheme. Under the Creative Communities initiative of the Creative Ireland programme, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, provides funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual cultural and creativity strategies from 2018 to 2022. Through Creative Communities, substantial funding has been provided to Carlow County Council for the period 2018 to 2022 and it has supported an extensive programme of engagement across the arts, culture and creativity in County Carlow.  These centres are also supported through capital schemes operated by the Department. The funding is available under the national development plan for cultural and creativity investment programmes. These are closely aligned with Creative Ireland and include a range of investments in regional arts and cultural facilities.  The cultural capital scheme from 2019 to 2022 is a €4.7 million capital investment scheme for arts and culture centres administered by the Department to enhance the existing stock of arts and culture centres across the country. In recent years, the arts centre in question was successful under a number of capital schemes. The centre was also awarded funding under the regional museum exhibition scheme and further details can be accessed on the Department’s website. Capital funding for the outdoor public space scheme has been provided to local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities taking account of public health guidance and of the needs of the local arts community. The Minister awarded €250,000 to Carlow County Council in 2021 to provide an outer public space at the Carlow Exchange in Carlow town. I understand that this project has now been completed and was officially opened last month and will be a centre for a range of social, cultural and educational events in Carlow. In summary, the Deputy will know that the arts centre along with the local authority is in receipt of funding from a wide range of public funding sources, including the Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions.	spk_370
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Arts Policy	dbsect_29	I thank the Deputy. Again, this reply has been delivered by me on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin. As outlined previously, primary support for the arts is delivered by the Arts Council. The topic raised by the Deputy asks that funding from the council for a gallery be extended to its in-house theatre. Under the Arts Act of 2003, the council is independent in its funding decisions and the Minister or officials in her Department cannot intervene in this decision-making. It would appear that this is a matter for the centre concerned, in consultation with the Arts Council, and may involve the local authority. The arts centre in question has been successful in sourcing capital funding from the Department under its capital schemes over a number of years. Under budget 2023, additional capital funding is proposed for the arts, which will include a new capital scheme, details of which will be announced in due course. I acknowledge the passion and belief the Deputy has in the provision of this arts centre and I also acknowledge, as she has outlined herself, the tremendous work of volunteers who have lent so much to this particular centre. She spoke passionately of the importance of the arts and I could not agree with her more in that respect. It is important that we do all that we can to seek to support that sector into the future. I reiterate what the Minister, Deputy Martin stated in her reply where she has made it clear that a number of funding streams have been made available to this particular arts centre, and that is as it should be. She specifically referred to the €210,000 and other streams of funding, which the Deputy has particularly welcomed. I will communicate to the Minister the passion with which the Deputy has spoken on this issue, the importance of this facility to all of Carlow and to the advancement and enhancement of the arts programme, the provision and sustainability of the arts into the future, and the Deputy's determination to secure that in the future.	spk_372

The Government has made an ongoing and firm commitment to support An Garda Síochána financially and provide it with the resources it needs to support more visible policing. This method will ensure that communities such as Clonmel are safe and that the people in them feel safe. However, I emphasise that, as recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, responsibility for community safety does not rest solely with an Garda or the Department of Justice. It is a whole-of-government responsibility. This principle is the cornerstone of the Government's policy on community safety and, significantly, will be provided for in law by the new policing security and community safety Bill. Under the legislation, when drafted, new, broader local community-safety partnerships will bring all services in the community together at local authority level, replacing the existing joint policing committees to serve as a comprehensive forum for discussion and decisions on community priorities. Three partnerships are currently being piloted and their operational experiences will feed into nationwide policy roll-out following the conclusion of the pilot period at the end of 2023. I will relay to the Minister for Justice the points the Deputy has raised but I reiterate that, since 31 August 2022, there have been 399 Garda members assigned to County Tipperary. Clonmel district is comprised of five stations with 76 Garda members assigned to it. This represents an increase of more than 4% since end December 2019. The district has been supported by 17 Garda staff, assigned to Clonmel station at the end August this year. I will bring the points the Deputy has raised to the attention of the Minister for Justice. That is the update I have received.	spk_368
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Arts Policy	dbsect_33	As the Deputy will be aware, I am presenting this information on behalf of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin. Primary support for the arts is delivered by the Arts Council. In 2022, the Minister allocated a record €130 million to the Arts Council. She was pleased to retain the €130 million in funding for the council in 2023 in recognition of the transformational impact that funding has had on the development of the sector, enabling the council to support more artists and arts organisations than ever before.The council is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003 and the Minister or officials in her Department cannot intervene in this decision-making. Recent decades have seen the development of a nationwide infrastructure of venues and arts centres, many of which were initiated and funded by local authorities. Current funding provided to these arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council is critical to ensure that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained. Local authorities are central to the support and development of the arts in Ireland through their own arts offices and through the resourcing and funding of arts centres.  In the context outlined it is understood that the council has made a number of funding awards to the arts centre referred to by the Deputy. This includes €210,000 of arts centre funding as well as commissions awards under its programme for young people children and education. I also understand that Carlow County Council has been awarded €100,000 by the council under the long-standing local arts partnership funding scheme. Under the Creative Communities initiative of the Creative Ireland programme, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, provides funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual cultural and creativity strategies from 2018 to 2022. Through Creative Communities, substantial funding has been provided to Carlow County Council for the period 2018 to 2022 and it has supported an extensive programme of engagement across the arts, culture and creativity in County Carlow.  These centres are also supported through capital schemes operated by the Department. The funding is available under the national development plan for cultural and creativity investment programmes. These are closely aligned with Creative Ireland and include a range of investments in regional arts and cultural facilities.  The cultural capital scheme from 2019 to 2022 is a €4.7 million capital investment scheme for arts and culture centres administered by the Department to enhance the existing stock of arts and culture centres across the country. In recent years, the arts centre in question was successful under a number of capital schemes. The centre was also awarded funding under the regional museum exhibition scheme and further details can be accessed on the Department’s website. Capital funding for the outdoor public space scheme has been provided to local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities taking account of public health guidance and of the needs of the local arts community. The Minister awarded €250,000 to Carlow County Council in 2021 to provide an outer public space at the Carlow Exchange in Carlow town. I understand that this project has now been completed and was officially opened last month and will be a centre for a range of social, cultural and educational events in Carlow. In summary, the Deputy will know that the arts centre along with the local authority is in receipt of funding from a wide range of public funding sources, including the Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions.	spk_370
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-11	dail	33	Arts Policy	dbsect_33	I thank the Deputy. Again, this reply has been delivered by me on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin. As outlined previously, primary support for the arts is delivered by the Arts Council. The topic raised by the Deputy asks that funding from the council for a gallery be extended to its in-house theatre. Under the Arts Act of 2003, the council is independent in its funding decisions and the Minister or officials in her Department cannot intervene in this decision-making. It would appear that this is a matter for the centre concerned, in consultation with the Arts Council, and may involve the local authority. The arts centre in question has been successful in sourcing capital funding from the Department under its capital schemes over a number of years. Under budget 2023, additional capital funding is proposed for the arts, which will include a new capital scheme, details of which will be announced in due course. I acknowledge the passion and belief the Deputy has in the provision of this arts centre and I also acknowledge, as she has outlined herself, the tremendous work of volunteers who have lent so much to this particular centre. She spoke passionately of the importance of the arts and I could not agree with her more in that respect. It is important that we do all that we can to seek to support that sector into the future. I reiterate what the Minister, Deputy Martin stated in her reply where she has made it clear that a number of funding streams have been made available to this particular arts centre, and that is as it should be. She specifically referred to the €210,000 and other streams of funding, which the Deputy has particularly welcomed. I will communicate to the Minister the passion with which the Deputy has spoken on this issue, the importance of this facility to all of Carlow and to the advancement and enhancement of the arts programme, the provision and sustainability of the arts into the future, and the Deputy's determination to secure that in the future.	spk_372
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-10-04	dail	33	Departmental Funding	dbsect_29	I thank the Deputy for his question and his ongoing interest in Cork Life Centre. The centre, in Sunday's Well, caters for young people who have encountered challenges in completing mainstream education. The centre is one of a number of such alternative education providers nationally. The Department of Education has provided funding to Cork Life Centre for the last number of years, with that support increasing significantly since 2018. In 2022 the Department will provide funding of €177,500, as well as 6,000 co-operation hours, in conjunction with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. In June of last year, as the Deputy alluded to, I was fortunate enough to visit the centre and had the opportunity to meet young people who attend the centre, their parents and guardians, staff from the centre and the management of the centre. I concur with the Deputy that I was truly impressed and grateful to have the opportunity to engage, particularly to engage directly with the centre's young people, to listen to them and to hear from them about their experience of Cork Life Centre. It really was a positive engagement from their point of view. During that meeting, the centre raised the issues of security of employment for their staff and terms and conditions, including payment rates for the centre's teaching staff. Staff employed in Cork Life Centre, under the co-operation hours arrangements by Cork Education and Training Board, are employed under terms and conditions, including pay scales, in line with arrangements which apply to settings outside the recognised school system. It is generally not unusual that tutors may hold qualifications that entitle them to recognised teacher status or registration with the Teaching Council, but payment rates and terms and conditions are generally dependent on the setting or sector in which a person is employed. A commitment was given to examine the circumstances around the payment of teachers at Cork Life Centre. I am committed to honouring that agreement through the Review of Out-of-School Education Provision. That review was carried out by a working group comprising representatives of stakeholders, including the Department of Education, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Tusla, SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland and the National Educational Psychological Service. The report on the review was published in May 2022. The review finds that out-of-school education settings are providing an important role in maintaining contact with education and supporting well-being for a key cohort of learners who have encountered challenges in mainstream settings through adopting a holistic approach based around the individual. However, approaches to the education curriculum, certification and education pathways for students are highly dependent on what can be provided for in each setting. Cork Life Centre is seeking sustainability for the future, which is what the Review of Out-of-School Education Provision aims to provide for the entire sector as a whole. It is intended that implementation of the report's recommendations will include developing criteria for structures, governance and level of education provision, including scoping out costs associated with such settings providing education for students who have encountered difficulties completing mainstream education. The work on the implementation is ongoing at present and is up and running. I confirm that to the House.	spk_378

The review is successfully completed and we have now moved on to the implementation process and the work on that has already begun. I am very keen to see progress made on the implementation of the recommendations of the report. In the interim, the level of funding currently provided to Cork Life Centre will continue. As the Deputy said, that amounts to €177,500 as well as the quite substantial 6,000 co-operation hours which are being provided in conjunction with the Department of Education. Until such time as the recommendations of the report are implemented, this funding will be in place and will provide ongoing support for the centre. I also give the Deputy a commitment that the Department will continue engagement with Cork Life Centre to determine a framework for sustainability for the centre and its staffing. Sustainability for the future is what Cork Life Centre has requested and is what it is seeking. Indeed, it is what the review of out of school education provision aims to provide for the sector as a whole, including Cork Life Centre. The body of work to advance the implementation of the recommendations is now under way and will be completed as soon as possible. There is an absolute commitment that this will include, as I have said already, looking at many of the issues that the Deputy has raised.	spk_380

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-09-28	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 6: General (Resumed)	dbsect_19	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on budget 2023 and how it pertains to education. I am joined by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for special education, Deputy Madigan. Budget 2023 provides for an increase of more than €440 million in core funding for the Department of Education. This is a very significant increase and one that furthers the work of recent years in reducing class sizes, reducing costs for families, tackling disadvantage and supporting the achievement of all students. The introduction of a new scheme to provide schoolbooks free of charge for all students in primary school has been a priority of mine since taking office and signifies an entirely new chapter in Irish primary education. This permanent initiative will greatly reduce the burden on families and reflects the importance this Government places on education for all children. In this budget, the Government is also continuing to deliver on its commitment to reduce class sizes. For the third consecutive year, I have brought in a measure to reduce class sizes by lowering the staffing schedule for schools, bringing it to an historic low of 23:1 in primary school. When the new staffing schedule will be implemented in the next school year, we will see further reductions in average class sizes and in the pupil-teacher ratio. It is a remarkable achievement that in every budget for the past three budgets over which I have presided that we have successfully reduced the pupil-teacher ratio by one point, as I said, bringing it to a historic low of 23:1. Since 2021, the Government has invested in an enhanced summer programme to support students at risk of educational disadvantage and help mitigate learning loss as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The programme has been extremely successful and the Minister of State and I are very pleased to announce funding this year to maintain the availability of this programme for all schools. It has been enormously valuable to students and continues to grow in popularity and impact. The Department is currently reviewing the summer programme in order to maximise the number of schools offering it and the number of students availing of summer provision in schools. The review involves engaging with other jurisdictions and stakeholders. Other new measures are included to address the impacts of Covid-19 and increase retention rates of students in schools, especially those from groups at risk of educational disadvantage. I am also announcing social inclusion measures that include enhancing the capacity of the education welfare services in Tusla that come under my Department's remit, as well as an increase in schools completion programme funding and funding for the home school community liaison programme.The Department of Education is also anxious to ensure a significant capital allocation to continue the roll-out of Project Ireland 2040, under which our schools will receive €4.4 billion in capital investment over the period from 2021 to 2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and to deliver high-quality school building projects with a real focus on sustainability for our school communities across Ireland. The budget allocation of €860 million for 2023 will deliver 300 building projects that are currently at the construction phase. The majority of these projects are expected to be completed in 2023. These projects include 50 new school buildings and extensions to approximately 250 schools. The continued roll-out of the national development plan will involve a further 150 school building projects that are currently at advanced stages of planning. These will commence construction in 2023.  This budget also provides funding in 2023 to progress our plans for senior cycle reform, which is also rooted in student well-being and putting students at the centre of the process, as they always should be. This is the single largest reform of the leaving certificate since it was established in 1925. It is right and proper that appropriate resources are now provided to advance this programme of reform. I have always believed that education is the very cornerstone of our country and I am very pleased to see that this Government is making such a significant investment in our education sector. This education budget is a progressive and inclusive budget that places learners and their needs at its very centre. I also welcome many of the other initiatives in budget 2023 such as the double payment of all welfare payments in October in addition to the normal double payment at Christmas, energy credits of €600 per family, a reduction of an average of €1,200 a year in childcare fees, two €500 tax credits for renters, a €500 grant for carers and those with disabilities, a €12 increase in core welfare payments, a reduction of €1,000 in college fees for all students, double SUSI payments, energy supports of up to €10,000 a month for SMEs, funding for 1,000 additional gardaí, a publicly funded IVF scheme, the extension of the GP visit card scheme meaning that more than half the population will now be eligible and free contraception for women up to 30 years of age. This has very much been a cost-of-living budget to support families and all sectors of our society. I welcome budget 2023.	spk_295

In that time my Department has presided over an ambitious programme of delivery across myriad areas, including more than €1.5 billion invested in a proactive schools building programme; in excess of €600 million in funding to support schools through Covid-19; an overall budget in excess of €2 billion per year on special education for the first time; the most significant expansion of the DEIS programme which seeks to deliver equality of opportunity in schools at an additional cost of €32 million, bringing the total investment to more than €180 million; a reduction in the primary school pupil-teacher ratio in every budget since the formation of this Government to 24:1, which is the lowest in the history of the State; an historic, innovative and student-centred reform of senior cycle that will empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century-----	spk_233

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-07-06	dail	33	Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_39	"I want to acknowledge at the outset the co-operation that has been forthcoming from Members of the House to this point, particularly from the Opposition spokespersons on education. In relation to this amendment, the Bill provides for new functions of school patrons, schools and boards of management in co-operating with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, particularly in the provision and operation of new special classes. The Deputy is seeking to amend a new function being placed on the school patron but has not proposed similar amendments to that function in respect of a school or indeed a board of management. The Bill provides for school patrons, schools and boards of management to co-operate with the NCSE without any conditions being attached to such co-operation. Accepting this amendment, which relates specifically to school patrons, would result in a lack of consistency in the new functions of school patrons, schools and boards of management in co-operating with the NCSE. I want to assure the Deputy that my Department and the NCSE are committed to resourcing and supporting schools to open new special classes. Some 300 additional special classes have been opened in the 2021-22 school year. At least 315 more classes are expected to open for the incoming 2022-23 school year. A relevant provision already exists in section 7 of the Education Act 1998, which relates to the functions of the Minister. Under section 7, the Minister is required to ensure that there is made available to each person who is resident in the State, including a person with a disability or other special educational needs, a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting their needs and abilities. Under section 7, the Minister is also required to provide appropriate funding to schools. In relation to the specific wording of the amendment, without some clarity on what is meant by ""the adequate provision of resources and supports"", it may be difficult to define what is involved when engaging with a range of school patrons in an effort to provide additional special classes. I have outlined a number of issues, including the need for consistency with other provisions in the Bill and the practical issue of the interpretation of the amendment. For those reasons, I regret that I cannot accept this recommendation."	spk_339
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-07-06	dail	33	Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_39	At the outset, I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and our absolute determination to ensure appropriate provision for all students, irrespective of their abilities and capabilities, and ensure that all children and young people are provided for in the education system. The Minister of State is working extremely hard to make sure that becomes a reality and I am working very closely with her. Together we are committed entirely to ensuring there is proper provision for all of our students. To specifically address the question around resources being made available, I want to be very clear to the Deputy that there is no question that the appropriate resources are not being provided to our schools. They are absolutely being provided. I assure the Deputy that the Department of Education and National Council for Special Education, NCSE, are 100% committed to resourcing schools to ensure they can provide for children with special educational needs. I am confident that is reflected in the work and what we see the length and breadth of this country in terms of excellent provision by schools in making the necessary provisions. As I said previously, my Department and the NCSE are working with schools to open at least 315 new special classes in mainstream schools for the coming year. Providing the necessary resources and supports is a huge part of this work. I will give the Deputy a flavour of the types of supports that are available. Mainstream schools opening new special classes are informed in advance of the range of supports available both from my Department and the NCSE. The supports include the Department's planning and building unit being available to work closely with schools opening new special classes. The Department has a framework of contractors in place to facilitate necessary work in schools and all works, whether they involve reconfiguration, additional accommodation needs or whatever is required, are 100% funded by the Department of Education. There is also the issue of staffing with the sanctioning of one additional teaching post at primary level or 1.5 additional teaching posts at post-primary and at least two SNAs for every special class of six children in place. There is a programme of professional support for schools with newly-established special classes, which is being developed by the NCSE. These supports include seminars for principals, four-day intensive training courses for teachers, two-day training courses for new teachers and whole-staff continuing professional development, CPD. The school is also linked with a NCSE adviser. There is, of course, the enhanced funding through increased capitation rates, a special class start-up grant and furniture and ICT grants. I want to be very clear about that. We can see that so many schools right throughout the country are taking up the opportunity when it comes to provision of special classes. We already have 2,118 in place since the 2021-2022 school year and 2,433 will be in place for the 2022-2023 school year, catering for more than 14,500 pupils. Clearly, therefore, the supports are being provided. Again, there is a very open policy of working hand-in-hand with schools in terms of meeting and identifying the individual needs schools might have, but also putting in place the resources they require.	spk_368
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-07-06	dail	33	Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_39	I very clearly outlined the significant resources that are being made available to schools. The special needs organisers and the NCSE work hand-in-hand with schools where there are issues and difficulties or challenges in terms of opening up or providing provision for children with additional needs. We work individually with schools to ensure that all issues or challenges can be met. As I said, very significant resources are being made available in terms of staffing. In terms of teaching staff, we have one teacher and at least two SNAs for six students at primary level and an allocation for 1.5 additional teaching posts, with the least two SNAs for six pupils, at post-primary level. Equally, I acknowledged the availability of the planning and building unit and that any reconfiguration of rooms and additional building work that is required are 100% funded by the Department. There is a programme of professional supports available to schools for newly-established special classes, whether that is the intensive training course for teachers, seminars for principals, two-day training course for new teachers, whole-staff CPD and, of course, the availability of the NCSE special adviser. As I said, there is the enhanced capitation rate, special start-up grant for special classes and furniture and ICT grant. I already outlined all of that. Specifically with regard to DEIS, although it is not part of the discussion this evening, I will be very clear that the model employed for DEIS, and the appeals process, was applied fairly across all appellants using an objective, data-based approach.The results are the results. They are fairly and evenly applied across the country. Indeed, I note with regard to Carlow that there were approximately 13 schools that were successful in their applications. The model is open and transparent and it is an even-handed and fair application of the Haase and Pratschke, HP, index. There is no question of unevenness in that respect.	spk_370
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-07-06	dail	33	Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_39	With regard to amendment No. 3, I must point out that the primary aim of this urgent new legislation is to truncate and streamline the current section 37A process. It is generally accepted by all stakeholders that the current process is too long, and I know the Deputy is of a similar view, as is the House. On one of the two occasions the section 37A process was used, it took 18 months to conclude. I note that this amendment is the first of a number of amendments the Deputy is proposing which seek to reintroduce existing provisions and steps from the current section 37A process into this new legislation. The Deputy's amendments aim to extend the shorter section 37A process provided for in the Bill, and would have the effect of delaying the issuing of a ministerial direction to a school. Assuming that this legislation is enacted in the coming weeks, these amendments together would have the effect of preventing the use of the new shorter section 37A process to address the immediate challenge facing us of providing places for children with special educational needs and requiring an appropriate place for the coming school year. There is already a significant level of engagement between my Department and the National Council for Special Education, particularly in the last two years, with regard to the forward planning of special educational needs placements. A significant level of information is shared by my Department's planning and building unit with the National Council for Special Education from the geographical information system. I am therefore confident that the NCSE will have a significant level of information from my Department which can be considered before the NCSE decides to prepare and submit a report to the Minister. As this amendment goes against the primary aim of the Bill, I cannot accept it. Regarding amendment No. 4, I understand the intention of the amendment. I assure the Deputy that it will be absolutely my intention that any future section 37A processes commence in a timely manner and well in advance of the beginning of a new school year. I know that this would be important for parents and children with special educational needs, and for the schools that might be subject to notices under section 37A. However, while understanding what the Deputy is trying to achieve in this amendment, the amendment does not allow for any flexibility in how the section 37A process could be used, and the flexibility in the process is important. There are situations which may arise where a Minister may need to issue notices in April or the month of May in advance of a new school year in September, and I do not want to preclude that being a possibility. The biggest reason for needing the flexibility relates to a situation where there may be a delay in a cohort of children being diagnosed and receiving a recommendation for a special class or special school placement or, indeed, regarding students coming from abroad and arriving in the month of April. The amendment would suggest that for five months there would not be an opportunity for us to progress. Assuming that the legislation is enacted in the coming weeks, this amendment would have the effect of preventing the use of the new shorter section 37A process to address the immediate challenge facing us in providing places for children. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment, but I assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that any section 37A process commences in good time. However, I do not believe we should restrict ourselves in the manner intended by the Deputy should an unforeseen circumstance arise where the section 37A process may be required for a small number of children or young people in a small circumstance, as it were. As regards amendment No. 5, as mentioned previously this is another amendment which seeks to lengthen the section 37A process. This cuts across the primary aim of the Bill, which I know the Deputy supports. The amendment would require the Minister in every instance to consult with stakeholders before specifying what resources the Minister considers appropriate to provide to a school to assist the school in making additional provision for education for children with special educational needs. The amendment does not provide a defined timeline for this consultation and the details of the range of stakeholders to be consulted are not provided. I assure the Deputy that the Department and the National Council for Special Education are committed to resourcing and supporting schools to open new special classes. Under the proposed new section 37A process, after the issuing by the Minister of the initial notice schools will have two opportunities to make representations, including representation in respect of resources. The Minister will also be required to consider any representations before moving to the next step in the process. Assuming this legislation is enacted in the coming weeks, these amendments together would have the effect of preventing the use of the new shorter section 37A process, which is what we are seeking to achieve here. In fact, amendment No. 5 has the effect of extending the proposed section 37A process and, therefore, I cannot accept it. With regard to amendment No. 6, I accept the importance of engagement with all education stakeholders and special educational needs advocacy groups on special education classes and special school places.In fact, I was very happy that the announcement of all this was supported by at least four of the advocacy groups, who welcomed this urgent legislation and asked that it be enacted as soon as possible. Amendment No. 6, however, would require the NCSE in every instance to engage with a range of education stakeholders before preparing a report under section 37A. The NCSE and the Department have ongoing engagement with education stakeholders on the provision of additional special classes and special school places. It is envisaged that the NCSE will have engaged with schools that might be considered under any section 37A process on a number of occasions before any such process would commence and, therefore, it would not be an unexpected development for the schools involved, and wider education stakeholders, for those particular schools to be considered under a section 37A process. As outlined in this amendment, it will have the effect of extending the proposed section 37A process and for those reasons I cannot accept the amendment. I fully appreciate the intention of amendment No. 7, but there are a number of issues with it. I assure the Deputy that it is my intention, and that of the Department and the NCSE, to provide appropriate educational resources to schools providing additional special classes. The Department and the NCSE can only make this commitment in respect of resources under our control. It is not the function of the Department or the NCSE to provide a number of the resources highlighted in the Deputy’s amendment. These resources are under the remit of other Departments and State bodies. This amendment and other amendments proposed by the Deputy relate to the core functions and role of the NCSE and its staff, in particular, the special education needs organisers, SENOs. Most of the amendments relate to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act. Given the pace at which this urgent legislation has been drafted, and how quickly it is now progressing, I suggest that we need more time and space to consider the issues being addressed in the Deputy’s amendments. The current review of the EPSEN Act might be an opportunity for us to consider these matters further. I apologise to Deputy Ó Laoghaire. I thought amendment No. 7 had been moved.	spk_375

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-07-06	dail	33	Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_39	That is grand. For the reasons outlined, I cannot accept amendment No. 7. On amendment No. 8, when the section 37A process is being used, it must be open and transparent. This is important for everyone involved. Openness and transparency must be at the heart of it for the schools involved and, in particular, for the parents of children and young people with special educational needs, their representative bodies and advocacy groups. Deputy Ó Ríordáin’s amendment seeks to remove that openness and transparency. I assure him that the section 37A process will continue to be an option of last resort. The preference remains for all parties involved to work together collaboratively to provide additional special classes. The Department and the NCSE will continue to engage with school authorities in a collaborative manner to provide additional special classes and special school places. It is through this engagement that the vast majority of additional classes are successfully provided for at present. However, where schools do not co-operate with the NCSE, and there is an identified need for additional provision in a particular area, it may be necessary to use the section 37A process. It is not intended that this will be a surprise development at any point for any school involved. To ensure the continued openness and transparency of the section 37A process, I cannot accept the amendment. I appreciate the Deputy has agreed to the new wording relating to amendment No. 9. On amendment No. 17, as I have said previously, in drafting this urgent legislation the Office of the Attorney General and the Department were anxious to ensure that the general purpose and objective of the legislation was reflected in the recitals section. I understand the purpose of what the Deputy suggested in his amendment. I agree it is vitally important that all organisations and individuals tasked with implementing the provisions of the Bill consult and work with parents of children with special educational needs. In recent times the Department has had significant engagement with special educational needs advocacy groups and representative bodies on a range of education matters. A special educational needs stakeholder forum is now operating, which is positive and helpful, and is leading to excellent co-operation and consultation, as it should. As I said previously, I am pleased, as I am sure everybody in the House will be, to acknowledge a number of the advocacy groups have welcomed this urgent legislation. It is also at their request that it be enacted as soon as possible. I confirm that myself and my Department are committed to continuing to work with parents, their representative bodies and advocacy groups on the implementation of this legislation and on special educational needs provision and policy into the future. This Bill provides for a new function of the NCSE to co-ordinate and manage the admission of children to special classes and special schools. Where the council decides to take on this role in a particular area, it will be done so only after consultation with parents and schools. I am confident that if the council decides to take on this new role in specific areas, it will be of significant assistance to parents, children and young people. I am satisfied that the legislation promotes the need for all parties to engage with parents of children with special educational needs regarding school admission and other matters. For that reason, I do not believe the Deputy’s amendment is necessary and, therefore, I cannot accept it	spk_383
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-07-06	dail	33	Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_39	I thank the Deputies for the points they have raised and for the amendments they have put forward. I absolutely accept in good faith the manner in which they were all made. I think we have a shared objective here, which is to realise the maximum potential for all students, and in this instance, particularly for students with additional needs, and the provision of special classes or placements in special schools for them. I have referenced the various issues with the amendments that have been proposed. There is an absolute priority here in streamlining the section 37A process. We know that it has been used in two previous instances. On one occasion the process lasted for more than 18 months. It is imperative that the process should be streamlined and the legislation enacted as quickly as possible. That is also the view of the advocacy groups. I know that the Deputies are aware of that. Through what we are doing today and as we move forward with it, we are ensuring that the process will take no more than six to eight weeks. On the provision of resources, I have outlined very clearly to the House that significant resources are provided by the Department of Education. I also wish to state that this is a step-by-step process that is undertaken with the schools, the NCSE and the special needs organisers working on the ground. It is a step-by-step process where schools are worked with collectively and individually to ensure that they have the confidence and the ability to open special classes or to provide for additional places in the special schools. Again, I wish to reiterate that significant resources are provided by the Department of Education, including the provision of additional teaching staff, with one teacher and at least two SNAs being provided for every six pupils in a special class and 1.5 teachers and at least two SNAs being provided for every six students at post-primary level. As I have said, all of the works in terms of reconfiguration from a planning and a building point of view are resourced by the Department, and equally, accommodation is 100% funded by the Department. Additional grants are also provided by the Department, such as the classroom start-up grant, the furniture grant, the ICT grant and improved capitation funding in recognition of what is happening in the schools. Training is provided for staff in schools opening special classes, and there is liaison between the school and the relevant NCSE adviser. As has been referenced, there are some aspects that are not within the remit of the Department of Education, specifically in relation to amendment No. 4. I appreciate the good faith in which Deputy Ó Ríordáin has brought the amendment. In an ideal scenario, 31 March would be the cut-off point. Indeed, that is our intention. However, as I have outlined, there will always be exceptions. It will not be workable for us if there is a lack of flexibility, with a period of five months when we cannot engage with schools on provision for exceptional cases as they can arise. There are limited circumstances, as we know, in which issues can arise and impact a school's engagement with the NCSE. It could be a case of delayed diagnosis. It could be a student is arriving from abroad. Indeed, a number of such students have recently arrived in Ireland. It is for that reason that we have included the provision. I appreciate that the Deputy has acknowledged those points in his withdrawal of amendment No. 4.	spk_387
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-07-06	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_46	I thank the Deputy. In March I announced, as she outlined, a major extension of the DEIS programme, which means that for the first time since 2017 the programme is being significantly expanded and eligible schools will gain access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme, at a cost of €32 million, and will extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest proportions of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage. Scoil Mhuire gan Smál in Carlow was granted DEIS band 2 status in the March announcement. From 2023, my Department will spend in the region of €180 million on the DEIS programme, which is an increase of €32 million. This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification, ID, model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage in schools. That is the key point: that it is concentrated levels of disadvantage in a school. All schools in the country, including the two schools raised by the Deputy, were considered for inclusion in the programme under the DEIS ID model. The model uses information from the school's individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data, as represented by the Pobal HP deprivation index.The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school. A detailed document outlining the refined DEIS identification model is published and available on  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. Schools were also provided with the opportunity to update their details on the Department's enrolment databases, the primary online database, POD, or post primary online database, PPOD, depending on the school. While Scoil Mhuire gan Smál in Carlow did appeal this decision, there was no change to the outcome of the initial application of the refined DEIS ID model. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants using an objective data-based approach and the results are final. I understand the concerns expressed by the school but I assure the Deputy that the model was correctly applied on foot of the data provided by the school.	spk_397
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-07-06	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_46	I acknowledge the Deputy's concerns. The extension of the DEIS programme has been significant. The programme for Government committed to completing the new DEIS identification model and to extending DEIS status to those schools that serve the highest concentration of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage. It is important to say that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in the development of an inclusive education system that supports all learners to achieve their fullest potential. While the programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work begins now. This will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. This will consider all schools both within and outside the DEIS programme. With specific regard to the gender aspect the Deputy has raised, there is no question of gender playing a part in the DEIS ID model; the HP index is used. This is used across multiple Departments. There were three additional weightings provided for. These include acknowledgement of children of Traveller or Roma background, children who reside in direct provision facilities and children whose families present as homeless.  The appeals process was applied absolutely fairly across all appellants using an objective, data-based approach. The results are final.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-07-05	dail	33	Back to School Costs: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_17	"I thank Deputy Ó Laoghaire and his colleagues for tabling this motion. I welcome the opportunity to speak to the House this evening on the important matter of back-to-school costs. I appreciate that the cost of returning to school every autumn is a significant element and, indeed, burden, in every family’s budget. I am acutely aware of the matters raised in the motion concerning back-to-school costs, especially in the context of rising cost-of-living expenses generally. Equality of access and opportunity in education has always been a core principle for Fianna Fáil and this Government and we recognise that reducing costs is an intrinsic part of this ambition. Earlier today, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Social Protection and I announced a package worth €67 million to support parents and students in their return to school. This package cuts across an array of services and needs, including the elimination of all fees on the school transport scheme, a €100 increase in the back-to-school allowance, and the expansion of the school meals programme to almost 60,000 more students. The school transport scheme and back-to-school allowance initiatives will put nearly €9 a week back into parents’ pockets. The back-to-school allowance scheme was introduced more than 30 years ago. I am pleased to confirm to the House that this payment will be increased by €100 for this coming academic year. This will benefit more than 262,000 children in 151,000 families right across the State. This payment will go some way to helping parents and families meet the cost of school attendance. Schoolbook funding has been increased every year over the past number of years, with increased funding available for book rental schemes, and a new free book scheme having been introduced in more than 100 Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, primary schools since 2020. It is my intention to continue to expand the provision of free books to all school children as resources allow. Every year, the school transport scheme provides a vital service to families across the families. In the last academic year, more than 121,000 students used the school transport scheme, including 15,000 students with special educational needs. I am delighted to confirm that for this coming academic year, parents will not have to pay a fee in order to access this vital service, with all fees being waived for those in receipt of a ticket. This will result in immediate savings of up to €500 for a family and will benefit more than 120,000 children. Where a parent has already made a payment in respect of their child’s ticket, this will be fully refunded. Further information will issue to all applicants in the coming days. The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,506 schools and organisations benefiting 230,000 children. As the Deputies present will be aware, earlier this year I announced the single most significant expansion of the DEIS programme, at a cost of €32 million and benefiting 347 additional schools. This will benefit 60,000 children, bringing the total number of students in the DEIS scheme to 240,000. The DEIS programme provides a wide range of supports to schools, including enhanced capitation payments, lower pupil-teacher ratios, and additional planning supports. I am pleased to confirm that the Government today extended the school meals programme to schools that have recently entered the DEIS programme, which will benefit 310 newly designated DEIS schools and almost 60,000 students. All of us know the value of a healthy meal for students. This is a very welcome measure from the Government and the Minister for Social Protection. As I mentioned earlier, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance payments will be paid to more than 150,000 families in respect of approximately 262,000 children for the coming school year. Today, the Government announced an increase of €100 in the back-to-school allowance for the coming academic year. Consequently, the amount being paid for each qualified child aged between four and 11 years will be €260 and the rate payable for each eligible child aged 12 and over will be €385. It is estimated that some 151,000 families will benefit from this measure in respect of over 262,000 children. This is a one-off measure for 2022 to assist families with back-to-school costs in the current school year. My Department already provides a book grant of more than €17 million annually to all recognised primary and post-primary schools within the free education scheme in order to provide assistance for books, including book rental schemes. All schools are encouraged to operate book rental schemes to help alleviate costs to parents. At primary level, 96% of schools operate a book rental scheme for parents. The programme for Government contains a commitment to ""Commence a free schoolbooks scheme pilot in September 2020 and, pending a successful review of the pilot, expand the scheme to schools nationwide, as resources allow.""Following a commitment in budget 2020 to introduce an extra support to reduce costs for families and school communities, €1 million of funding for a pilot book grant scheme in primary schools was provided. More than 15,000 pupils across 102 primary schools have benefited from this increased investment. This scheme will continue this year, and I intend to seek funding to expand this programme in future budgets. The Department has also issued a circular to all schools, asking schools to adopt numerous measures in order to minimise costs for parents and families. This includes the provision of a book rental scheme and the phasing out of the use of non-reusable workbooks. Schools are also asked to create a uniform policy which ensures that all items are available from a variety of shops to allow parents and guardians to shop around, and that these uniform items only have iron-on crests. As Deputies will be aware, students have recently concluded their leaving certificate and junior cycle examinations. This year, in recognition of the financial pressures faced by parents, all examination fees have been waived for every examination student. In addition to meeting salary costs and providing for building construction and maintenance, the Department provides capitation grant funding directly to schools to cater for day-to-day school running costs such as heating, lighting, insurance and general upkeep. For example, a voluntary secondary school with 500 pupils will receive capitation and ancillary funding of €316,575. A primary school with 150 pupils will receive capitation and ancillary funding of €53,400. This funding notwithstanding, the Department fully understands and accepts the need for improved capitation funding, and therefore the Government has provided for a combined 7.5% increase in standard capitation funding for all recognised primary and post-primary schools over the last number of budgets. It is my intention to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets. Primary and post-primary schools in the free education system are not permitted to charge any form of mandatory fee. No charge may be made in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum, or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part. Where voluntary contributions are sought from parents, it must be made clear to all families that the contributions are voluntary in nature and that payment or non-payment of these fees will have no bearing on their child's place in a school. These are some of the measures that the Government and Department of Education have taken to reduce the burden of back-to-school costs on parents, guardians and families. The Government is committed to continue to build on the good progress made in this area and we are also conscious of the impact that the cost-of-living pressures are having across all of our society."	spk_172
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-07-01	dail	33	Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_3	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time.""I appreciate the opportunity to introduce and speak on this important legislation, the Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022. I fully recognise the importance of inclusive education for all children. It is my primary objective as Minister for Education to promote and support actions that will ensure the school setting is a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. My Department is committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality, where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach his or her full potential. We strive to ensure that all children have access to an educational experience that is appropriate to their needs and supports both their academic and personal development. Our policy, which is set out in the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 is that children with special educational needs should be educated in mainstream placements with additional supports provided as appropriate. Where children require more specialised educational settings, such as special classes or special schools, the Department and National Council for Special Education, NCSE, ensure the necessary resources and supports for such placements are provided in line with the needs of the child. The active collaboration of school communities to this end is essential and the importance of a welcoming and inclusive environment cannot be overstated. Within this context, providing for an appropriate school placement for every child with special educational needs in a timely and supported manner is a key priority for the Department and the National Council for Special Education. The National Council for Special Education is statutorily responsible for planning and co-ordinating provision at both a local and a national level and advising the Department in this regard. The Department continues to work closely with the NCSE and other key stakeholders in relation to the requirements for special class and special school places and the more strategic and longer term requirements. The legislation which I am bringing to the House today is an important step in ensuring that children with special educational needs are provided a school place appropriate to their needs. This legislation means a child-centred and child-focused approach is taken to the provision of special education classes. I am confident we all share a common goal to do everything within our power to ensure every child with special educational needs who requires a special class or special school placement is provided for as a priority. The Department of Education currently invests more than €2 billion in additional provision for children with special education needs. This represents more than 25% of the Department's total annual budget. Access to education by every child with special education needs is designed to provide the appropriate and necessary supports to ensure the fullest potential of every child is achieved. For the coming school year, at least 315 additional new special classes have been sanctioned by the National Council for Special Education, catering for more than 1,800 additional students, bringing the total number of such classes to almost 2,500, providing for more than 14,000 students. While this illustrates the strong evidence of the progress made in meeting the needs of children with special educational needs in recent years, there is no doubt more work needs to be done. The National Council for Special Education advises that just over 100 children remain without an appropriate special educational need placement for the coming school year. I acknowledge the excellent work of so many school communities across the country on special education provision. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I have visited many of these schools and have seen first-hand the outstanding work being done every single day across the country. However, despite all efforts, there has been an inability to deliver the final number of places required as the number of children with special educational needs continues to increase. My Department and the National Council for Special Education will continue to engage intensely with school authorities to open new special classes. This legislation can also play a key role in helping us with those efforts. Where efforts to work with schools to open new special classes are not sufficient to meet the demand for places, this legislation provides for a much shorter process than currently exists to allow for schools to be directed to open additional classes. The Department and I intend that the provisions within this legislation, once enacted, will be used to ensure that an adequate supply of special class places are available to students. I confirm to the House that when a special class is established, the Department of Education provides funding for new staff. For example, certain special classes will consist of six students, one teacher and at least two SNAs. There will be support from the planning and building unit of the Department for any physical alterations required to the school building, a grant for equipment, enhanced capitation, support from the National Educational Psychological Service and a range of training courses provided by the National Council for Special Education. Budget 2022 already provides for a significant increase in the number of special class and special school places for children. As a consequence, my Department envisages that the cost of providing additional special classes for children for the start of the coming school year will be met within the Department's existing budgetary allocation. There are 12 sections in the Bill and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will shortly set out for Members' information and consideration the provisions under each section of the Bill. The key provision in this legislation provides for a truncated Section 37A process, whereby the Minister can direct a school to make additional provision for children with special educational needs. It is envisaged that this new process can lead to a ministerial direction to be served on school within six to eight weeks of receiving a report from the NCSE setting out its opinion that there are insufficient schools places in a certain area. Where the existing section 37A process has been used twice already, those processes took between six and 18 months. This clearly underlines the need for a new, speedy and more time-efficient process. I appreciate that that is what we are setting out to achieve today. I invite the House to note that the new shortened process will still allow two opportunities for school patrons and boards of management to make representations to the Minister ahead of a direction issuing. This is an important consideration and assurance for both school patrons and boards of management. In drafting the legislation, the Office of the Attorney General and my Department also took the opportunity to add additional functions to school patrons, schools and school boards. This relates to co-operating with the National Council for Special Education to provide additional capacity for children with special educational needs when requested, and compliance with a ministerial direction to open new classes or a direction from the National Council for Special Education to provide for a child with special educational needs. The legislation also provides for school admission policies to include a positive declaration setting out that schools will provide for children with special educational needs. The legislation provides for an explicit function to allow the National Council for Special Education to manage and co-ordinate the admission of children with special educational needs in co-operation with parents and schools where necessary. This will reduce the burden on parents and I think we are all supportive of any mechanism or measure that will assist parents and guardians of children and young people with special education needs. I acknowledge the significant work of the Attorney General and his officials, who worked with my Department to draft this important legislation in such a short period.I express my sincere appreciation to the members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for agreeing to a waiver of the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill given the urgency of the situation. I look forward to working with colleagues in both Houses to progress this important legislation and I thank Members in advance for their co-operation."	spk_54
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_2	As the Deputy will be aware, school transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current year, more than 121,400 children, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The cost in 2021 was €289 million. It is worth noting that in the last number of years, the number of children using the scheme has increased by more than 8,000. In the most recent academic year, capacity was increased to cater for more than 1,500 additional pupils arriving from Ukraine. Under the terms of the school transport scheme, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from the school they are attending and it is their nearest national school. At post-primary level, they are eligible where they reside not less than 4.8 km from the post-primary school or education centre they are attending and it is the nearest post-primary school or education centre. Distance is determined by the Department and Bus Éireann and rules have regard to ethos and language. As the Deputy will be aware, the Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it is adequately supportive of the provision of service to students and their families. The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs. The review of the primary and post-primary school transport schemes examines how the schemes currently operate, including eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the scheme. The review also examines the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme in a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that use transport services. Following commencement of this review, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report. Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021-22 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school. Wider considerations regarding the operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review, which is under way. A number of meetings have been convened and a number of discussions have taken place. Decisions with regard to measures for the 2022-23 school year will be made shortly.	spk_2
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_2	I agree with the Deputy. I believe there is an opportunity - it is one that we are taking via the review - to carry out a complete root and branch of the school transport service as regards how it meets the needs of students and families. The Deputy referred to how we can integrate the service, ensure best value for everybody concerned and so forth. He is correct that the interim review results led to me making the decision to accommodate those who are attending their second nearest school. Decisions regarding measures for the 2022-23 school year will be made and announced shortly. The completion of the review will take place before the end of this year. It is likely to be the third quarter or start of the fourth quarter but most likely the former. I am very conscious of the need to advance this matter and the enormous benefit the school transport scheme provides for families the length and breadth of the country. It is important that we have a system that works effectively for all involved.	spk_4

The Deputy will be aware that the Government announced there would be a reduced cap for fees for multiple children at post-primary level. It has now been reduced from €650 to €500 and from €220 to €150 at primary level. I am very conscious of the importance of the scheme and measures of this nature. Obviously, we must look at everything in a budgetary context going forward. I wish to highlight that proactive steps have already been taken, however. It is the purpose of the review to look at all aspects in terms of accessibility, value for money and meeting the needs of families and students. It is all-encompassing.

This programme uses a professional external project manager to co-ordinate and drive the design team to achieve the best possible timeframe for the project through the stages of architectural planning to tender and, ultimately, construction. This is the third ADAPT delivery programme undertaken by my Department since 2016 and involves major building projects for 30 schools, including, as the Deputy referenced, the new school for Gaelcholáiste Phort Láirge. The tender process to appoint the project manager commenced in December and is now complete. The appointed project manager carried out a site visit to Gaelcholáiste Phort Láirge on 24 June. The Department recently contacted the school authority with an update regarding the completion of the project manager appointment and the upcoming tender process for the appointment of a design team. The role of the design team is to design the project in accordance with the Department's design team procedures. This involves various stages, including preliminary design, detailed design, planning permissions and then onwards to tender and constriction. Until the design team has a preferred design option agreed and fully costed, and until all statutory applications have been granted in stage 2(b) of architectural planning, it will not be possible to provide timelines regarding the progression of the project to tender and construction stages. The anticipated timelines for projects in the ADAPT programme to complete the pre-tender stage of architectural planning is within 24 months of the design team appointment. As I noted, this does not include the time that could be involved if there are delays in the planning application process, or an appeal to An Bord Pleanála is encountered, but it will be the timetable to which the project manager and the design team are guided to work towards.	spk_20
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputy. I sincerely acknowledge the excellent work that goes on in the school, including its delivery of education to its students, its role in the community and the excellence of the entire school community. This school is a priority for delivery but there is a process. On the procurement process, in the first instance, the appointment of the project manager involved a detailed commercial process that had to be completed. It is very positive that the process has been completed. It is particularly positive that a site visit has taken place and was done as a priority. That means we can advance to the next stage. The appointment of a design team is a significant body of work in that we are talking about the architect, quantity surveyor, civil construction engineer, mechanical and electrical engineer, fire safety consultant, project supervisor for the design process and all of that. It will be given every opportunity to progress apace. I am mindful of what the Deputy said about the planning process, which will obviously be helpful.	spk_22
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_2	Every opportunity is being provided here. The Department is very clear in its intention to deliver an ambitious schools building programme throughout the country which includes this school. As the Deputy can see from the report I have given, the project is moving apace. It is a significant acknowledgement that following the appointment of the project manager, the site visit has taken place and now we can continue to move apace, to use the Deputy's phrase. It is important for the benefit of all school communities that we have the facilities that meet their needs. Every opportunity and priority we can give will be given.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_2	School secretaries and caretakers, as we have all agreed in this House, are very valued members of our school communities. I am fully aware of the vitally important role played by them in the running of our schools. I fully support, as does everyone, this important agreement which will improve their terms and conditions, and rightly so. The majority of primary and post-primary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions, that staff member is an employee of the school and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. Fórsa tabled a claim in 2019 seeking parity of these staff with education and training board, ETB, public service staff. Extensive engagement has taken place since then between the Department, school management bodies and Fórsa to work towards a resolution, with the support of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. On 24 February this year, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a suite of measures designed to improve the working conditions of school secretaries was proposed, which Fórsa agreed to recommend to its members. As the Deputy indicated, a ballot was undertaken, the result of which was 95% agreement in favour of the deal.  I was very pleased with this overwhelmingly positive result on this long-running issue, the resolution of which has been a priority for me since my appointment. The work to implement this agreement has now commenced in conjunction with Fórsa. It requires a complex process of assimilating information to capture accurate data in respect of each individual secretary. Additional resources are in place to provide capacity to manage this process to ensure both individual and school data are captured and correctly applied. This will also require the development of an IT system to collect the data and action the payroll obligations.  As this work is currently ongoing, it is not possible to commit to an exact timeline, but the Department has expedited the process and will communicate further as the work progresses. The Department has issued a circular to schools to outline how the agreement will be implemented. The circular outlines that as a first phase of implementation of the agreement, schools must, before the end of September, calculate the initial assimilation rate of pay and annual leave entitlement for secretaries and offer it to them. Should the secretary choose to move to the new terms, the new pay rate should be applied by the school from 1 September 2022. The verification of this first phase, the calculation of back pay and the option to have the value of jobseeker's benefit included in pay will be addressed in the second phase of the assimilation process.	spk_26

However, I will be upfront and honest that there is a considerable body of work involved here. Each secretary is employed by the relevant school board of management. The work has commenced in conjunction with Fórsa. It is a complex process of assimilation of information in order that accurate data with regard to each individual secretary are captured. The additional resources that have been required have been put in place by the Department. The work also involves setting up an entirely new IT system to collect the data and that is ongoing.

It is also a matter of gathering the individual data for each of the secretaries in terms of his or her service. That is a body of work and we are giving absolute priority to it. The complex process has already begun. The resources that are required from my Department have been put in place. The new IT system that will be needed to manage the process is being put in place. I acknowledge the work schools will do before the end of September in calculating the initial assimilation rate of pay and the annual leave entitlement for secretaries.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_9	As the Deputy will be aware, for school planning purposes the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and utilises a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including school enrolment data and information on residential development activity, is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department's projections of school place requirements. Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, the Department makes an assessment of existing capacity in that area and its ability to meet any increased demand. Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, the delivery of such is dependent on the circumstances of each case and may be provided through one or a combination of the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools and provision of a new school or schools. The Department's projections of post-primary school place requirements in east Cork show continued growth in enrolments in the short to medium term across most areas, with most growth anticipated in the Midleton-Carrigtwohill school planning area. In response to projected future need and to enrolment pressures in the area, there has been significant capital investment by the Department in post-primary schools in east Cork. While the Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in east Cork, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may be the consequence of a number of issues, for example, duplication of applications; school of choice; where some towns or areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils; or there may be an external draw of pupils coming from outside the local area. The Department is working to establish the true extent of capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in east Cork, to identify capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action.	spk_47

That will be a new school building which will cater for 1,000 pupils plus 3 SEN classes and it is being delivered under the Department's design and build programme. It is currently at stage 4. The letter of acceptance issued to the preferred tender on 1 June, commencing the school building contract for the school, as the Deputy has acknowledged.The Department has approved a grant to St. Aloysius' College, Carrigtwohill, to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils and two special educational needs, SEN, classes. The project has been devolved to the school authority for delivery and is at stage 1. The Department has approved a grant to Pobalscoil na Tríonóide in Youghal to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,200 pupils and two SEN classes. The project has been devolved to the school authority for delivery. There is to be an extension to Coláiste an Phiarsaigh in Glanmire to cater for 1,000 pupils and two SEN classes. There is a building project to expand the capacity of Carrignafoy Community College to cater for 600 pupils and three SEN classes. This is being delivered by the patron, Cork Education and Training Board. The project is at stage 1. A devolved grant has been approved to facilitate the expansion of Coláiste Muire, Cobh, to include two SEN classes. Considerable progress is being made in this area.	spk_49

As I have said, I am very familiar with the area and am very conscious of its growth and development. I appreciate the Deputies' acknowledgment of the significant investment the Department is making in the east Cork area. It speaks for itself. When I list the schools, it is very obvious we are committed to delivering the resources required in the area. As I said to the Deputies previously, it is also important to acknowledge we keep everything under review within the Department. We constantly seek to reach out where there are issues. I acknowledge the co-operation of the schools with regard to the sharing of information, which has been very positive and helpful.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_9	As the Deputy will be aware, the State Examinations Commission, SEC, has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the leaving certificate examinations. The State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education are acutely aware of the needs of candidates and other stakeholders in regard to the provision of leaving certificate results, and the State Examinations Commission has being doing everything it can to ensure results are delivered as soon as possible. The intended date of Friday, 2 September, is in line with the date leaving certificate results issued to students in both 2020 and 2021. Some 131,000 candidates are undertaking State examinations this year, which represents an increase of 6% on the last time a full set of junior cycle and leaving certificate examinations were run, in 2019. There are significant factors which, when taken together, meant it was not previously possible for the SEC to give a planned date for the issuing of leaving certificate results. These factors included the holding of a deferred sitting of leaving certificate examinations for students who experienced close family bereavement, suffered serious injury or illness, or were unable to present for an examination on public health grounds due to Covid-19; the commitment that the overall set of results in 2022 would be no lower, in the aggregate, than the 2021 results; and the availability of sufficient numbers of examiners to mark written examinations. In addition, as with other years, sufficient time must be allowed for an extensive range of checks and quality assurance procedures in advance of the issue of the results. These are required to ensure the highest standards possible are maintained. The State Examinations Commission has an absolute responsibility to examination candidates to ensure their work is marked to the highest standards of quality and integrity, and the commission must be able to stand over the results it issues each year. In March of this year, officials from my Department and the SEC briefed the further and higher education sector on challenges that could arise this summer. Over the past two years, by working collectively with education stakeholders, it was possible for the further and higher education system to respond to the needs of students wishing to continue their education and training. I am confident this will be the case again in 2022.

For that reason, appropriate provision had to be made for students, taking that environment into account. That is exactly what students, their families and the school communities wanted. That is equally true with regard to our achievement in previous years. It is remarkable that, throughout the Covid pandemic, we have found opportunities for students through the calculated grades process in 2020, the accredited grades process with the offer of a seated examination for students last year, which was almost unique in the world, and the full sitting of the examination this year with accommodation for a second sitting. It is also important the commitment was given to students that the overall results in 2022 would be no lower, in the aggregate, than the 2021 results. It is important the State Examinations Commission can stand over the integrity of the examinations.

In March of this year, officials from the Department of Education and the State Examinations Commission briefed the further and higher education sector on challenges that could arise this summer, particularly with regard to the release of results. The further and higher education sector made provision in this regard last year and I have every confidence it will do likewise this year. Those discussions took place in March so notification was provided as to the challenges there. It is my understanding the results date is within the UCAS timeframe. Regarding international students, in a similar fashion to the past two years, we have taken a very proactive approach. I have written personally to my European counterparts on the matter.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_9	My Department has had engagement from both St. Laurence College and its trustees, Le Chéile Schools Trust, in respect of the school property. The school and trustees have indicated their willingness to support the Department in meeting educational needs in the area. This is very positive and welcome. The school has committed to making both mainstream places and places for pupils with special educational needs available. This proactive and positive approach to providing for pupils with special educational needs must be commended and it is very welcomed. In support of this provision for pupils with special educational needs, the Department has approved capital funding to provide the necessary accommodation under the additional school accommodation scheme. As part of this project, the Department has also approved the provision of specialist rooms to support the school in its delivery of the curriculum to all of its students. As Deputy Carroll MacNeill will be aware, the school is located in an area that is undergoing significant growth, especially within the nearby Cherrywood strategic development zone. Such development is considered as part of the Department’s strategic planning for school accommodation needs. The Department’s strategic planning utilises a geographical information system and uses data from a range of sources, including enrolment data, school transfer patterns, census statistics, information on current and planned residential development and Project Ireland 2040 housing and population targets. Analysis of capacity at existing schools also forms part of the Department’s planning process, as well as the potential for expansion of schools in each area. The Department also works closely with local authorities in respect of their statutory planning processes, including with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, where it has incorporated appropriate schools provision as part of the Cherrywood planning scheme. This scheme includes four primary school sites and two post-primary school sites, intended to meet the education needs of the new population in Cherrywood. The first school, a primary school, Cherrywood Educate Together National School, opened in September 2020. The establishment of two further schools has been announced and planning in that regard is advancing in tandem with the pace of residential development. However, my Department continues to keep school accommodation requirements under review in all areas, in consideration of primary, post-primary and special educational needs. Additionally, under Project Ireland 2040 there will be an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of existing school stock, including an energy retrofit programme.	spk_61
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_9	School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, more than 121,400 children, including in excess of 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The cost in 2021 was more than €289 million. It is worth noting that in recent years the number of children using the scheme has increased by in excess of 8,000. During the previous academic year, there was an increase in capacity to cater for more than 1,700 additional pupils arriving from Ukraine. As the Deputy is aware, the Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and whether it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. The review will also consider the objectives of the school transport scheme in the context of other Government policies as they relate to school transport and, in particular, the potential of the school transport scheme to promote sustainability in transport, reduce car journeys and support rural development. The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs. The review of the primary and post-primary school transport schemes will examine each element of the schemes and include eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes. The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments. Following commencement of this review, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report. Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021-22 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time. Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review, which is under way. The technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation over recent months, including running a public survey for parents or guardians and students who use the service, as well as those who do not use the service but who would like to. These engagements have yielded extensive data, which are now being considered. The group has also consulted a broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments.	spk_64

That motivation is to ensure that we are meeting the needs of students and families, that we are providing opportunities, and that we have a clear emphasis on value for money. We also want to ensure we are conscious of accessibility for students and of encouraging families to use buses and public transport as opposed to family cars. The Deputy referred to the cost of living. Just recently, conscious of the cost of living, there have been lower caps for multiple children, with a reduction in the cost of utilising the school transport system from €650 to €500 for secondary school children, and €200 to €150 for primary school children. The reason for the review is ensuring that we have a service to meet the needs.	spk_66

I am under no illusions about it and appreciate that the Deputy is not either. A significant service is being provided. More than 121,400 students avail of it. We intend to maximise use of the service. In recent years, more than 8,000 more students have availed of the service. Our objective is to ensure the maximum number of students are facilitated to avail of the school transport system. We can see benefits all round for families, the environment and so much more. The review engages all stakeholders, the general public, school communities, providers of the service and others. All aspects and the point the Deputy raised are being looked at.	spk_68
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_9	The State Examinations Commission, SEC, has responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations and has provided me with the following information.  Candidates experience many forms of trauma and adversity, such as serious illness and bereavement, around the time of the leaving certificate examinations and may be sitting examinations at a time that is not optimal for them.  For the 2022 leaving certificate examinations, the SEC is providing an extended scheme of deferred examinations within the policy context of the scheme of reasonable accommodations at the certificate examinations, RACE. RACE was originally established to support students with a complex variety of special educational needs in accessing the examinations each year. As well as providing accommodations for candidates with permanent or enduring special needs, the RACE scheme also provides for emergency situations that occur during the examinations each year. Until 2019, candidates who missed their leaving certificate examinations due to bereavement, or for any other reason, had no option but to sit their examinations the following year. Deferred examinations were first held in 2019 for candidates who experienced bereavement of a close family member. Prior to the pandemic, the SEC had been considering the broader issue of how best to support candidates experiencing different forms of trauma and adversity at examination time. This included consultation with stakeholders, as well as research into practices in other jurisdictions. For the 2022 leaving certificate, the commission has considerably extended the eligibility for the deferred examinations to candidates unable to sit their examinations in the main sitting due to serious accident, injury or illness. Candidates who are absent from examinations on public health grounds due to Covid-19 also have access to deferred examinations. The overarching principles in providing deferred examinations to those who need them include safeguarding integrity and maintaining confidence in the leaving certificate to ensure equity and fairness for all candidates. Every effort will continue to be made by the SEC and by schools to accommodate candidates who suffer bereavement, illness, or other trauma either immediately before or during the examinations.  In addition, the longstanding arrangements under the RACE scheme to support candidates in taking their examinations as scheduled include sitting the examinations in special centres or in hospital, provision of rest breaks, and timetable alterations. These arrangements are available to candidates ineligible for deferred examinations.	spk_70
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_9	To be clear, the SEC has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. I am cognisant of the unique circumstances we find ourselves in this year, particularly due to Covid. I have been an advocate from the beginning that there should be a second sitting of the examination. I am mindful that students should have the maximum opportunity to showcase their talents. The second sitting of the examination allows for that, particularly if there is a case of Covid, a significant medical emergency, a family bereavement or something of that nature. In light of all that we have experienced this year, it is important to have a review of how the scheme operates and how this particular sitting of deferred examinations has operated. There should be a review that engages all stakeholders. The SEC is committed to that.	spk_72
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy. Again, I want to be clear. I have never been ambiguous around the fact that I am an advocate of students getting the maximum opportunity to showcase their talents and present themselves in the best possible light at every step in education, including in the leaving certificate exam. I have said very clearly that there will be a review of the operation of the scheme. This is right and proper. There has been great learning, this year and previously, and I believe we need to look at these learnings going forward. At the centre of it must be the opportunity for students to perform to their best capacity. This review, which will take place under the auspices of the SEC, will be very helpful and will provide direction going forward.	spk_74
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_12	As the Deputy will be aware, for school planning purposes the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and utilises a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including school enrolment data and information on residential development activity, is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department's projections of school place requirements. Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, the Department makes an assessment of existing capacity in that area and its ability to meet any increased demand. Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, the delivery of such is dependent on the circumstances of each case and may be provided through one or a combination of the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools and provision of a new school or schools. The Department's projections of post-primary school place requirements in east Cork show continued growth in enrolments in the short to medium term across most areas, with most growth anticipated in the Midleton-Carrigtwohill school planning area. In response to projected future need and to enrolment pressures in the area, there has been significant capital investment by the Department in post-primary schools in east Cork. While the Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in east Cork, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may be the consequence of a number of issues, for example, duplication of applications; school of choice; where some towns or areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils; or there may be an external draw of pupils coming from outside the local area. The Department is working to establish the true extent of capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in east Cork, to identify capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action.	spk_47
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-06-30	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_12	We keep everything under constant review in terms of demand for places. It is important to point out there has been significant development in the east Cork area. The Deputy referenced Carrigtwohill Community College. That will be a new school building which will cater for 1,000 pupils plus 3 SEN classes and it is being delivered under the Department's design and build programme. It is currently at stage 4. The letter of acceptance issued to the preferred tender on 1 June, commencing the school building contract for the school, as the Deputy has acknowledged.The Department has approved a grant to St. Aloysius' College, Carrigtwohill, to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils and two special educational needs, SEN, classes. The project has been devolved to the school authority for delivery and is at stage 1. The Department has approved a grant to Pobalscoil na Tríonóide in Youghal to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,200 pupils and two SEN classes. The project has been devolved to the school authority for delivery. There is to be an extension to Coláiste an Phiarsaigh in Glanmire to cater for 1,000 pupils and two SEN classes. There is a building project to expand the capacity of Carrignafoy Community College to cater for 600 pupils and three SEN classes. This is being delivered by the patron, Cork Education and Training Board. The project is at stage 1. A devolved grant has been approved to facilitate the expansion of Coláiste Muire, Cobh, to include two SEN classes. Considerable progress is being made in this area.	spk_49

I appreciate the Deputies' acknowledgment of the significant investment the Department is making in the east Cork area. It speaks for itself. When I list the schools, it is very obvious we are committed to delivering the resources required in the area. As I said to the Deputies previously, it is also important to acknowledge we keep everything under review within the Department. We constantly seek to reach out where there are issues. I acknowledge the co-operation of the schools with regard to the sharing of information, which has been very positive and helpful.

The State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education are acutely aware of the needs of candidates and other stakeholders in regard to the provision of leaving certificate results, and the State Examinations Commission has being doing everything it can to ensure results are delivered as soon as possible. The intended date of Friday, 2 September, is in line with the date leaving certificate results issued to students in both 2020 and 2021. Some 131,000 candidates are undertaking State examinations this year, which represents an increase of 6% on the last time a full set of junior cycle and leaving certificate examinations were run, in 2019. There are significant factors which, when taken together, meant it was not previously possible for the SEC to give a planned date for the issuing of leaving certificate results. These factors included the holding of a deferred sitting of leaving certificate examinations for students who experienced close family bereavement, suffered serious injury or illness, or were unable to present for an examination on public health grounds due to Covid-19; the commitment that the overall set of results in 2022 would be no lower, in the aggregate, than the 2021 results; and the availability of sufficient numbers of examiners to mark written examinations. In addition, as with other years, sufficient time must be allowed for an extensive range of checks and quality assurance procedures in advance of the issue of the results. These are required to ensure the highest standards possible are maintained. The State Examinations Commission has an absolute responsibility to examination candidates to ensure their work is marked to the highest standards of quality and integrity, and the commission must be able to stand over the results it issues each year. In March of this year, officials from my Department and the SEC briefed the further and higher education sector on challenges that could arise this summer. Over the past two years, by working collectively with education stakeholders, it was possible for the further and higher education system to respond to the needs of students wishing to continue their education and training. I am confident this will be the case again in 2022. In similar fashion to the past two years, contacts with international counterparts are taking place and will continue over the summer to ensure Irish students continue to have all options available to them.	spk_54

Budget 2022 progressed the ongoing major investment in our primary education sector by providing a further reduction of one point for the 2022-23 school year so that primary schools would be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of one classroom teacher for every 24 pupils in September 2022. This brings the staffing schedule to a further new historic low for primary schools. Lower thresholds apply to DEIS urban band 1 schools. In addition, there has been a reduction of three points in the retention schedule, which has helped schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts. The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain published criteria. The primary school referred to by the Deputy has had its appeal considered by the Primary Staffing Appeals Board and has been informed that it will retain its current staffing for the 2022-23 school year, pending - this point is important - confirmation that the school meets the required enrolment threshold in September. Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by the Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolments. The Department provides a staffing allocation to each education and training board, ETB, based on the overall enrolment of the schools within the ETB. The distribution of this staffing allocation is a matter for the chief executive officer, CEO, of the ETB based on the overall enrolment of the schools within the ETB. The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department's website. In accordance with the published staffing arrangements, each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. Where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, the Department considers applications for additional short-term support, for example, curricular concessions as the case arises. This concession is available as a short-term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue. The allocation processes include appellate mechanisms under which schools and ETBs can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The ETB can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board, which was established specifically to adjudicate on appeals on staffing allocations in post-primary schools. The Post-Primary Appeals Board operates independently of the Department.	spk_347

The Department of Education is committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is supported in reaching their full potential. We must have an education system that celebrates each child and young person within its care and strives to meets his or her individual needs. This is at the heart of what we do across the education sector and it is especially at the heart of special education provision, which is a priority area for investment for this Government. I commend the excellent work happening in many schools around the country in this regard. As part of my work as Minister for Education, I am deeply fortunate to visit very many schools throughout the country and to meet with their students, staff, parents and broader community members. I am continually awed by the warmth, integrity and excellence in teaching and learning which I see in classrooms and schools throughout the country, including in respect of special education in both mainstream and specialised settings. This year, the Department will spend in excess of €2 billion, or more than 25% of the Department's budget, on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs. This is right and proper and we will continue to increase investment to support students and young people over the term of this Government. Departmental policy and educational expertise support children with additional education needs being integrated in mainstream education to the greatest extent possible, with additional resources and supports such as differentiated learning, student support plans, special education teachers and SNAs being made available to schools and students. The total number of special education teachers in the mainstream school system is 14,385 in 2022 - an overall increase of 980 teaching posts. Provision has been made for 19,169 SNAs by the end of 2022, which represents an overall increase of 1,165 posts. It is important to note that students do not require a formal diagnosis or assessment to access these supports. This ensures that schools and students are able to access supports in a streamlined manner. This being said, the Department recognises that some children and young people require more specialist support and it is committed to making special school and special class places available for these children. Ensuring that appropriate class placements are available for students remains one of the key priorities for the Department. One of the most difficult situations that can arise for any child or parent is for an appropriate school place to not be available for the child. I will use this opportunity to outline some of the progress that has been made as well as work that we are continuing to do in this regard because I recognise that work must continue apace to ensure that there is joined-up thinking and co-ordination in this regard. The NCSE is statutorily responsible for planning and co-ordinating provision at both a local and a national level and advising the Department in that regard. A network of SENOs, who are located throughout the country, will continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs. There is ongoing intensive engagement between the Department, the NCSE and other key stakeholders on short-term requirements for special class and special school places and the more strategic and longer-term requirements on a national and local basis. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will update the House in respect of the section 37A process. I would also like the House to note that engagement is ongoing between the Department and the Office of the Attorney General in respect of the legislative tools available to further expedite this process. A number of initiatives have been put in place by my Department over the past two years to assist with the planning and co-ordination of special educational needs provision. These new initiatives are bearing fruit with 315 new special classes due to open for the 2022-23 school year, which will create more than 1,800 places for students. Two new special schools were established in Dublin in 2021. A new special school has been established in Cork in this school year and a new special school is being established in the 2022-23 school year in Cork. Following on from strategic engagement with the Spiritan Education Trust, a new special school will be established in the 2022-23 school year at the Templeogue College campus in Dublin, with the overall objective being to develop a modern, permanent provision for this school to enable it to cater for up to 150 pupils when completed. This will add very significant capacity for south Dublin area. Furthermore, the Department is committed to planning for the future and all major building projects, such as new school buildings and significant extensions, must include space for special class provision as standard. Between 2018 and 2021, permanent accommodation for 292 special classes and additional capacity for 122 classrooms in 22 special schools was delivered. A further 700 projects are currently progressing under the Department's capital plan, which will deliver more than 1,300 new SEN classrooms and 200 replacement SEN classrooms to cater for approximately 7,800 SEN pupils in primary and post-primary education. Almost 100 of these projects are currently on-site, which will ultimately deliver classroom spaces for almost 1,000 additional SEN pupils. This investment is reflective of the broader and greater ambition that we hold for the sector. We will absolutely continue to prioritise investment in this vital and significant area. As such, I propose the Government's countermotion for consideration this evening. I again acknowledge the exemplary work of many schools in the area of special education provision throughout the country. This notwithstanding, I also know from listening to and hearing from young people and families that more work must continue to be done to ensure that every child, including those with additional educational needs, receives timely access to every support he or she might need to reach his or her fullest potential. We must never lose sight of this goal and I look forward to continuing to work with everyone around the table, including all key stakeholders and interested parties, to ensure this the case. In this regard, I thank the Deputies for raising these important matters and I look forward to the debate."	spk_276
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-19	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_37	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as an gceist agus as an deis chun freagra a thabhairt dó ó thaobh na scoile seo. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the current position in regard to the major building project for Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin in Finglas East, Dublin 11. The project is included in my Department's construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan, NDP, as part of the Project Ireland 2040 framework. Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately €4.4 billion in capital investment over the period from 2021 to 2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty with our ambitious plans to deliver high-quality building projects, with a real and particular focus on sustainability, for school communities throughout Ireland. The investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. It will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help to transition the school system to an era of net-zero carbon by 2050. As the Deputy will be aware, the brief for the Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin project provides for the development of a 16-classroom school, with an additional two classrooms for pupils with special educational needs, including the refurbishment of the existing school buildings, minor demolitions, construction of a new school extension and all associated works on the school's existing site at Glasanaon Road. The major building project for Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin will be delivered under the Department's accelerated delivery of architectural planning and tendering, ADAPT, programme. Under the programme, a professional external project manager co-ordinates and drives the design team to achieve the best possible timeframe for the delivery of projects through the stages of architectural planning, tender and on to construction. The tender process to appoint a project manager has just been completed. The first step to be undertaken by the project manager will be the tender competitions for the appointment of design teams for a number of school building projects. This will include the appointment of the design team to progress the project for Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin. The Department will shortly advise the school authorities of further developments in regard to these appointments. Upon appointment, the design team will proceed to stage 1 of architectural planning, that is, preliminary design, whereby the team will assess the site and current school buildings and prepare their initial sketch schemes. The scope and extent of works to be carried out will be established during this early stage. My Department is currently engaging with the school's patron to explore the potential for providing interim accommodation on the school site to facilitate the establishment of a special class for the 2022-23 academic year. I appreciate all the points the Deputy has made, which are to his credit. I want to be clear that this project is now moving in a positive direction in terms of the appointment of a project manager and the other steps that will follow in suit.	spk_302

I absolutely understand all the Deputy has outlined and I appreciate the enormous tribute that is richly deserved by the community, which has worked so hard to advance the school and promote it. Indeed, credit is due also to the community for the manner in which it has embraced the school and ensured it has thrived, as the Deputy outlined. I appreciate how important it is to everybody involved in the school that the project be advanced as a priority. I thank the Deputy for his graciousness in acknowledging the positive step forward that is the completion of the tender process for the appointment of a project manager. The project is part of the ADAPT programme, as I indicated. The next step is the appointment of the design team, which will incorporate a consultant architect, civil structural engineer, building services engineer, quantity surveyor and others. Once it begins, that process will take approximately 12 weeks. The design team will then begin stage 1 of the architectural planning, which will encompass the site investigation, including the condition of the existing school buildings, which is an important consideration, site suitability, the initial sketch scheme and all of that. The next steps will be submission of a pre-stage 1 report to the Department for review and sign-off to develop an agreed design option, followed by the submission of a summary stage 1 report to the Department, based on the agreed preferred design option, for review and approval. I am absolutely determined that this process will move as quickly as possible for all of the reasons the Deputy rightly outlined. I commend everybody involved in growing and nurturing this very significant school.	spk_304
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-19	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_37	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. It gives me an opportunity to present the most up-to-date information to the House. I will say to the House, as I did to the Deputy personally, that it was an excellent visit to east Cork. I very much appreciated the opportunity to meet the schools and school communities on the ground and have very positive engagements. We are very appreciative of that. I acknowledge that many of the points raised with me on the day with regard to issues did not pertain to my Department. There was an absolute acknowledgement, in terms of the resources for English as an additional language, EAL, or additional hours required by schools to meet the demands of having additional students from Ukraine, having already been met by my Department. I gave a commitment on the day that will continue going forward. As Minister for Education in the Department of Education, I acknowledge that our schools throughout the country have done great work in welcoming Ukrainian children and young people into their communities. I have witnessed this excellent work first hand when I have visited many schools, including in the Deputy's constituency. The Department of Education published figures on Monday which show that almost 6,000 students from Ukraine have enrolled in primary and post-primary schools. The Department has allocated additional resources as required for these enrolments, including teaching hours for EAL. All schools who enrol Ukrainian students are eligible for additional EAL support. The Deputy will appreciate the scale of the response needed when more than 30,000 Ukrainians have arrived to date. This was why the Department moved quickly in the early phase of the Ukrainian crisis to establish regional education and language teams, REALTs, throughout the country to co-ordinate school enrolments for Ukrainian families. They have been a key element of the Department's supports for all schools, establishing relationships with each community response forum and with the Tusla education support service, TESS. Other agencies are also linked into these teams, including the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the inspectorate. All school management bodies have nominated representatives to liaise with each REALT. The primary role of REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures and the initial focus is on assisting families in securing school places, when they are ready to engage with the school system. It is important that it is when they are ready to engage. REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support the Department in developing new capacity where required and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined area. The Deputy will recall that there was a very positive endorsement of the work of REALT in our engagement with school management. These teams will ensure that clear, accessible information flows are in place between schools, local education support services and national support structures. The Department is committed to providing every support possible to all those fleeing war in Ukraine and seeking protection in Ireland. These teams will provide critical support in aligning current school capacity with the placement of Ukrainian families as much as possible. The Department's data show that there is generally good capacity across the country, albeit there may be capacity pressures to be managed in some areas.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-19	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_37	I reiterate to the House the Government's commitment to welcome people fleeing the war in Ukraine and seeking protection in Ireland. That welcome is extended across society. The Department's primary concern is to ensure children and young people of schoolgoing age from Ukraine are provided with appropriate educational opportunities. I acknowledge, as I did at the outset, the tremendous work that our students, school leaders and staff are doing and continue to do in welcoming Ukrainian children and young people into our schools over the past three months. I acknowledge the professionalism and care and welcome that they give to Ukrainian families every day. Specifically, as I have outlined, a suite of resources is being made available to schools and being drawn down by them. I have seen that first-hand, whether that includes English as an additional language or additional teaching hours and additional teaching posts as required, depending on the numbers that arrive to our schools. That has been acknowledged. We are currently seeking to roll out the English for speakers of other languages, ESOL, project, which is where we are putting in place additional language tutors for those who do not have English as a first language. That resource will be available to post-primary students and adults. A community and family approach is being taken to accessing language. Regarding planning for the new school year, all the requirements that schools currently have for additional staffing and resources are being provided for. The Deputy will appreciate that it is a fluid situation. Families continue to arrive at different times and they will continue to arrive over the summer. Whatever resources are required in September will also be put in place. The Deputy referred to counselling and NEPS facilities. NEPS psychologists are on the ground working with schools. All resources required to ensure that children and young people are adequately, suitably and appropriately catered for in schools are being put in place. That supplements the excellent work taking place in school communities. I have visited many counties and there has been positive feedback on REALT. Schools are not required to take students if they do not have capacity. It is REALT's function to find appropriate accommodation in appropriate schools where there is capacity or to make alternative arrangements. As I said earlier, we know that we have great capacity in some areas and less in others. We are working closely with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to ensure that, if at all possible, accommodation matches capacity in our schools. I appreciate it can be difficult to do that.	spk_308
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-19	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_40	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as an gceist agus as an deis chun freagra a thabhairt dó ó thaobh na scoile seo. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the current position in regard to the major building project for Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin in Finglas East, Dublin 11. The project is included in my Department's construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan, NDP, as part of the Project Ireland 2040 framework. Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately €4.4 billion in capital investment over the period from 2021 to 2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty with our ambitious plans to deliver high-quality building projects, with a real and particular focus on sustainability, for school communities throughout Ireland. The investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. It will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help to transition the school system to an era of net-zero carbon by 2050. As the Deputy will be aware, the brief for the Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin project provides for the development of a 16-classroom school, with an additional two classrooms for pupils with special educational needs, including the refurbishment of the existing school buildings, minor demolitions, construction of a new school extension and all associated works on the school's existing site at Glasanaon Road. The major building project for Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin will be delivered under the Department's accelerated delivery of architectural planning and tendering, ADAPT, programme. Under the programme, a professional external project manager co-ordinates and drives the design team to achieve the best possible timeframe for the delivery of projects through the stages of architectural planning, tender and on to construction. The tender process to appoint a project manager has just been completed. The first step to be undertaken by the project manager will be the tender competitions for the appointment of design teams for a number of school building projects. This will include the appointment of the design team to progress the project for Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin. The Department will shortly advise the school authorities of further developments in regard to these appointments. Upon appointment, the design team will proceed to stage 1 of architectural planning, that is, preliminary design, whereby the team will assess the site and current school buildings and prepare their initial sketch schemes. The scope and extent of works to be carried out will be established during this early stage. My Department is currently engaging with the school's patron to explore the potential for providing interim accommodation on the school site to facilitate the establishment of a special class for the 2022-23 academic year. I appreciate all the points the Deputy has made, which are to his credit. I want to be clear that this project is now moving in a positive direction in terms of the appointment of a project manager and the other steps that will follow in suit.	spk_302

I absolutely understand all the Deputy has outlined and I appreciate the enormous tribute that is richly deserved by the community, which has worked so hard to advance the school and promote it. Indeed, credit is due also to the community for the manner in which it has embraced the school and ensured it has thrived, as the Deputy outlined. I appreciate how important it is to everybody involved in the school that the project be advanced as a priority. I thank the Deputy for his graciousness in acknowledging the positive step forward that is the completion of the tender process for the appointment of a project manager. The project is part of the ADAPT programme, as I indicated. The next step is the appointment of the design team, which will incorporate a consultant architect, civil structural engineer, building services engineer, quantity surveyor and others. Once it begins, that process will take approximately 12 weeks. The design team will then begin stage 1 of the architectural planning, which will encompass the site investigation, including the condition of the existing school buildings, which is an important consideration, site suitability, the initial sketch scheme and all of that. The next steps will be submission of a pre-stage 1 report to the Department for review and sign-off to develop an agreed design option, followed by the submission of a summary stage 1 report to the Department, based on the agreed preferred design option, for review and approval. I am absolutely determined that this process will move as quickly as possible for all of the reasons the Deputy rightly outlined. I commend everybody involved in growing and nurturing this very significant school.	spk_304
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-19	dail	33	School Admissions	dbsect_41	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. It gives me an opportunity to present the most up-to-date information to the House. I will say to the House, as I did to the Deputy personally, that it was an excellent visit to east Cork. I very much appreciated the opportunity to meet the schools and school communities on the ground and have very positive engagements. We are very appreciative of that. I acknowledge that many of the points raised with me on the day with regard to issues did not pertain to my Department. There was an absolute acknowledgement, in terms of the resources for English as an additional language, EAL, or additional hours required by schools to meet the demands of having additional students from Ukraine, having already been met by my Department. I gave a commitment on the day that will continue going forward. As Minister for Education in the Department of Education, I acknowledge that our schools throughout the country have done great work in welcoming Ukrainian children and young people into their communities. I have witnessed this excellent work first hand when I have visited many schools, including in the Deputy's constituency. The Department of Education published figures on Monday which show that almost 6,000 students from Ukraine have enrolled in primary and post-primary schools. The Department has allocated additional resources as required for these enrolments, including teaching hours for EAL. All schools who enrol Ukrainian students are eligible for additional EAL support. The Deputy will appreciate the scale of the response needed when more than 30,000 Ukrainians have arrived to date. This was why the Department moved quickly in the early phase of the Ukrainian crisis to establish regional education and language teams, REALTs, throughout the country to co-ordinate school enrolments for Ukrainian families. They have been a key element of the Department's supports for all schools, establishing relationships with each community response forum and with the Tusla education support service, TESS. Other agencies are also linked into these teams, including the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the inspectorate. All school management bodies have nominated representatives to liaise with each REALT. The primary role of REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures and the initial focus is on assisting families in securing school places, when they are ready to engage with the school system. It is important that it is when they are ready to engage. REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support the Department in developing new capacity where required and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined area. The Deputy will recall that there was a very positive endorsement of the work of REALT in our engagement with school management. These teams will ensure that clear, accessible information flows are in place between schools, local education support services and national support structures. The Department is committed to providing every support possible to all those fleeing war in Ukraine and seeking protection in Ireland. These teams will provide critical support in aligning current school capacity with the placement of Ukrainian families as much as possible. The Department's data show that there is generally good capacity across the country, albeit there may be capacity pressures to be managed in some areas.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-19	dail	33	Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020 Report: Motion	dbsect_42	I would like to begin by acknowledging and thanking the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for its detailed report on the Bill, particularly noting the committee's emphasis on ensuring equity and access in the admissions policies of Irish schools. This ambition is shared by the Department, which commits to creating an education system in which everyone has access to an excellent education that is inclusive of all, irrespective of belief system, race, ethnicity, class, culture, gender, language or ability. As Deputies are aware, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 was signed into law in July 2018. The overall objective of the Act is to provide a framework for school enrolment that is designed to ensure that every child is catered for and that the way in which schools decide on applications for admission is transparent. It requires all schools to set out clearly the admissions criteria that are used for parents and prospective parents.  The Act provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the Traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single-sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation. The Act also sets out certain criteria that schools cannot take into account when deciding on an application for admission, such as consideration of a student's academic ability, skills or aptitude, consideration of a parent's occupation, financial status, academic ability, skills or aptitude, apart from exceptions provided by the Act, as a consideration for the offer of a school place. In January 2020, certain sections of the Act were commenced in order to be operational in time for the admission processes for the 2021-22 school year. From February 2020 all recognised schools in Ireland were required to draft a new school admission policy in accordance with the Act's requirements. These new admission policies which have been approved by patrons after consultation with parents of children attending the school, are now published on individual school websites. These policies applied for admission to school for the first time last September. As such, the operation of this Act and its provisions remains in relatively early stages. Schools have worked extremely hard in developing, consulting on and drafting these new policies. The Act requires that any subsequent changes to a school's admission policy requires the approval process to be undertaken again before the admission policy could be published by the school. The Bill proposes to delete section 62(10)(b) of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018. The section that the Bill proposes to delete allows schools, and this is an important consideration, if they so desire, to take into account a student's connection to a school by virtue of a parent or grandparent having previously attended the school when deciding on an application for admission to that school. This is subject to a limit of 25% on the number of available places that can be filled by a school using this criterion. This was used in recognition of the ties which parents, grandparents and broader families may have to schools. The use of this provision is subject to the discretion of the school, and it should also be noted that this criteria has no impact on schools where there is no oversubscription. The Department sought information from management bodies of schools in relation to the use and impact of this provision in respect of school admissions for September 2021. The responses received from schools indicated that there are a minimal number of schools nationally that use the full 25% provided for in the Act. At primary level, 907 schools responded to the survey, and of these only 4.7% of them use this criterion. At post-primary 537 responded with 19% applying this provision. However it is worthwhile to note that only 17 of these schools used the full 25% allowed for by the Act. The joint education committee has made a number of recommendations in its report, which will be considered fully by my Department. The committee recommends establishing an expert group to review and compile data on school admission policies. I am supportive of this recommendation. I am also very mindful that the current admissions process of schools is relatively new and has only taken effect for the first time for admission to the 2020-21 school year. To be effective, a longer timeframe is required for the Department and expert group, as recommended by the committee, to undertake a review and compilation of data to provide an opportunity for a greater analysis and evaluation of the measure set against a number of school admission cycles. This would also avoid burdening schools with having to amend school admission policies so soon after they were implemented for the 2020-21 school year. I look forward to engaging with the committee further on the nature of such a review as recommended.	spk_310
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-19	dail	33	Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020 Report: Motion	dbsect_42	I thank both Deputies for their contributions on the committee report and the broader issues related to the admissions Act. It sets out important requirements on transparency that must be adhered to in schools' admissions policies. I am conscious that the Act was commenced fully only in the past academic year. Deputy Ó Murchú referred to the need to tackle disadvantage across society. Significant resources have been made available by the Department of Education to target disadvantage in education specifically. The Deputy will be aware that the single biggest investment in the DEIS programme was recently announced by me. Through the programme, significant resources are being made available to schools in areas with a significant level of disadvantage, to the tune of €18 million this year and rising to €32 million next year. It is very much about giving the optimum opportunity and support to all students, irrespective of their socioeconomic background or experience. On the admissions policy, which has been raised, I am conscious that it is new. I am also conscious that all schools are required to do significant work to update their admissions policies. This has been a considerable undertaking for them. The policy has now operated for just one school cycle, namely, the 2021–22 school cycle. Even in that short time, we have been given an opportunity for some learnings, but not complete learnings. As I referred to earlier, even the information sought from the management bodies of schools on the use and impact of the provision has made for some findings. At primary level, the survey responses came from 907 schools and indicate that only 4.7% of those schools use or invoke the criterion in question. At post-primary level, 537 schools responded, with 19% applying the provision.  I am conscious that the joint committee has made a recommendation, in its report, on the concept of an expert group and on that group having an opportunity to compile data that would reflect how the policy is working, specifically in respect of where, if, when and how the 25% limit is being implemented. It is clearly the view of the joint committee that there are learnings in this regard. I acknowledge that the Deputies have acknowledged the importance of having learnings. I propose that we take the opportunity to work on the joint committee's recommendation to have an expert group.The Department of Education is happy to do that. I consider this a significant and positive way forward because it will give us an opportunity to analyse the data as they become available and make an informed judgment on how the admission policies are operating. There is an obligation on us to show we have taken informed decisions and have taken the time to inform ourselves of the operation of our schools. I propose we work with the recommendation of the joint committee for an expert group, which will work with the Department of Education in this area. I thank both Deputies for the time they have taken to engage in the important issue of schools admissions policy.	spk_312
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_2	A range of measures are in place to reduce back-to-school costs and also to help families with these costs. The Department published a circular in 2017 which sets out principles of cost-effective practice to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of returning to school. Under these measures, schools are required to select school uniforms that are generic and can be purchased from an array of retailers and only iron-on or sew-on crests should be used. The circular also sets out that schools should consult parents on their views and suggestions on cost-reduction initiatives for school uniforms. The Department also supports schools to help reduce the cost of schoolbooks. Schools are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books. Under the book rental scheme, the Department provided funding of €17.2 million in 2021 to schools. Some 96% of primary schools and 69% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme for parents. Additional funding of €1 million was provided under budget 2020 to provide free books in delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, primary schools on a pilot basis. Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of €21 per pupil. This pilot provided an additional €64 per pupil to increase the overall book grant rate to €85 per pupil enrolled in the school. This is in line with the costings as set out in the 2019 Barnardos report on the real cost of school, which states that €85 is the average cost of schoolbooks at primary level. This funding was allocated to 102 DEIS primary schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020-21 school year. This funding has continued for the 2021-22 school year. The aim of this pilot is to provide free schoolbooks for students in the schools involved and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of schoolbooks for parents. It will continue to run for the 2021-22 school year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible. I recently announced the expansion of the DEIS programme benefiting 347 schools. Some 310 schools will be included in DEIS for the first time and 37 existing DEIS primary schools are being reclassified and will be eligible for increased supports. Schools in the DEIS programme are provided with additional financial support by way of a DEIS grant and an enhanced schoolbook grant rate. I also understand the need for improved capitation funding to schools for running costs and I am pleased that budgets 2020 and 2019 provided for increases in standard capitation funding for primary schools.	spk_2
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_2	Deputy Ó Laoghaire needs to take a more holistic view of the various measures we have in schools. For example, as I already referenced, significant funding has gone into DEIS. We have more schools than ever in DEIS, following the single biggest increase in the DEIS profile for schools, costing to the tune of €18 million this year and increasing to €32 million in 2023. In addition, specifically in terms of measures of late, in recognition of the pressure facing families, this year the Government reduced the cost of school transport, which will come on stream for this school year. The cap on school transport fees that currently stands at €220 for families at primary level and €650 for families at post-primary level will be reduced to €150 for a family at primary level and to €500 per family at post-primary level. Furthermore, in recognition of cost-of-living expenses, all examination fees have been voided this year, so there is no cost to families in that regard. That is in addition to the suite of measures that have been introduced by the Government across various sectors such as the fuel allowance and the electricity credit payment.	spk_4
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_2	I reiterate that the book scheme was extended and the pilot programme has run for two years. We have given a commitment that we will review the programme and look at the potential going forward for it to be either continued or extended. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire is aware, that is a budget consideration. It is important that we allow the pilot to complete and for it to be fully reviewed. He would accept that is best practice in regard to any model. Equally so, it is important to acknowledge that under the book rental scheme, more than €17.2 million has been expended by the Department of Education to ensure that families have access to books. Some 96% of primary schools and 69% of post-primary schools are availing of the book rental scheme. Notwithstanding that, in recognition of the opportunity to do something more with books, going forward, when the pilot scheme concludes it will be reviewed and appropriate action will be taken then.	spk_6
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_2	Access to sexual and health education is an important right for students and it is equally important that this education meets the needs of students in their day-to-day lives and reflects models of best practice. The Department of Education continues to work closely with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to give best effect to the commitment in the programme for Government to develop inclusive and age-appropriate relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE, curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex, LGBTI+, relationships and making appropriate legislative changes, if necessary. The work of the NCCA draws on its Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools, which was published in 2019. As the Deputy will be aware from the Second Stage debate of the Private Members’ Bill tabled by him, arising from recommendations in that report the NCCA has been following a two-track approach on this work. First, the NCCA has a focus on developing support materials for teachers for publication online as part of the online guidance toolkit. The toolkits will support teachers in their engagement with the current SPHE-RSE curriculum in a confident and holistic manner and in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. Separate toolkits, which are being used by schools, are available for the primary, junior cycle and senior cycle curriculum areas. In tandem with this work, the NCCA is progressing the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum, with an initial focus on junior cycle. A draft revised junior cycle specification is due to be agreed at the NCCA council in advance of the summer, with a public consultation to follow. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and rolled out in 2023 and will be followed by revised specifications for senior cycle and primary. In addition to this, I have recently announced the Department's intention to provide funding for a new postgraduate programme to upskill registered post-primary teachers teaching SPHE and RSE. In the course of the programme, it is intended that each participant will be provided with high-quality content knowledge and will be empowered to become an effective and enthusiastic teacher of SPHE-RSE. The Department has recently engaged with higher education institutions and it is hoped that a number of them will be interested in designing and developing this programme. I am keen to allow the NCCA time to complete its development work in this important and sensitive area. This is why, as the Deputy is aware, on Second Stage of the Bill on 16 November, the Government tabled a timed amendment that the motion be read in nine months’ time. My Department continues to engage closely with the NCCA to assist completion of this work.	spk_20
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_2	I acknowledge the Deputy's personal engagement with this issue. I also acknowledge we have made significant progress in progressing this. As I have articulated, I can point to the fact that specifications for junior cycle are due to be published very shortly, followed by public consultation, which has marked this process. At the same time, preparation has begun for senior cycle and we are also looking at the revision at primary level. It is equally important to say that all children and young people have a right to access correct and factual information. That is an absolute given. Equally, as part of my intention to advance this, we are doing all that we can to ensure teachers will be properly trained in all areas so there will be what the Deputy called continuity across all schools. I am rolling out the upskilling programme for teachers, which is covered through funding by the Department. As I said, there is an absolute commitment to allowing the work of the NCCA to progress and to read the Bill again in nine months' time.	spk_22
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_2	Again, I very clearly reiterate the curriculum must be followed in our schools. All schools must follow it and all students are entitled to the full and factual information as presented by our curriculum. In anticipation of that, we have very clearly set out the process to ensure our curricula are as current, up to date and appropriate as is necessary and possible. The work is ongoing, which I appreciate the Deputy referenced. While the work is being completed in updating and reviewing the present curriculum, we have ensured we are putting in place a variety of supports for our schools that can be drawn down by our school staff. We are now putting a postgraduate programme in place, the cost of which will be covered by the Department, that will be open to our schools to ensure our staff are fully trained. As I said, there is an absolute commitment to advance this in as timely a manner as we possibly can.We have made significant progress. I am committed to ensuring that is completed.	spk_24
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	School Costs	dbsect_3	A range of measures are in place to reduce back-to-school costs and also to help families with these costs.

Under these measures, schools are required to select school uniforms that are generic and can be purchased from an array of retailers and only iron-on or sew-on crests should be used. The circular also sets out that schools should consult parents on their views and suggestions on cost-reduction initiatives for school uniforms. The Department also supports schools to help reduce the cost of schoolbooks. Schools are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books. Under the book rental scheme, the Department provided funding of €17.2 million in 2021 to schools. Some 96% of primary schools and 69% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme for parents. Additional funding of €1 million was provided under budget 2020 to provide free books in delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, primary schools on a pilot basis. Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of €21 per pupil. This pilot provided an additional €64 per pupil to increase the overall book grant rate to €85 per pupil enrolled in the school. This is in line with the costings as set out in the 2019 Barnardos report on the real cost of school, which states that €85 is the average cost of schoolbooks at primary level. This funding was allocated to 102 DEIS primary schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020-21 school year. This funding has continued for the 2021-22 school year. The aim of this pilot is to provide free schoolbooks for students in the schools involved and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of schoolbooks for parents. It will continue to run for the 2021-22 school year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible. I recently announced the expansion of the DEIS programme benefiting 347 schools. Some 310 schools will be included in DEIS for the first time and 37 existing DEIS primary schools are being reclassified and will be eligible for increased supports. Schools in the DEIS programme are provided with additional financial support by way of a DEIS grant and an enhanced schoolbook grant rate. I also understand the need for improved capitation funding to schools for running costs and I am pleased that budgets 2020 and 2019 provided for increases in standard capitation funding for primary schools.	spk_2
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	School Costs	dbsect_3	Deputy Ó Laoghaire needs to take a more holistic view of the various measures we have in schools. For example, as I already referenced, significant funding has gone into DEIS. We have more schools than ever in DEIS, following the single biggest increase in the DEIS profile for schools, costing to the tune of €18 million this year and increasing to €32 million in 2023. In addition, specifically in terms of measures of late, in recognition of the pressure facing families, this year the Government reduced the cost of school transport, which will come on stream for this school year. The cap on school transport fees that currently stands at €220 for families at primary level and €650 for families at post-primary level will be reduced to €150 for a family at primary level and to €500 per family at post-primary level. Furthermore, in recognition of cost-of-living expenses, all examination fees have been voided this year, so there is no cost to families in that regard. That is in addition to the suite of measures that have been introduced by the Government across various sectors such as the fuel allowance and the electricity credit payment.	spk_4
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	School Costs	dbsect_3	I reiterate that the book scheme was extended and the pilot programme has run for two years. We have given a commitment that we will review the programme and look at the potential going forward for it to be either continued or extended. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire is aware, that is a budget consideration. It is important that we allow the pilot to complete and for it to be fully reviewed. He would accept that is best practice in regard to any model. Equally so, it is important to acknowledge that under the book rental scheme, more than €17.2 million has been expended by the Department of Education to ensure that families have access to books. Some 96% of primary schools and 69% of post-primary schools are availing of the book rental scheme. Notwithstanding that, in recognition of the opportunity to do something more with books, going forward, when the pilot scheme concludes it will be reviewed and appropriate action will be taken then.	spk_6
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Legislative Programme	dbsect_6	Access to sexual and health education is an important right for students and it is equally important that this education meets the needs of students in their day-to-day lives and reflects models of best practice. The Department of Education continues to work closely with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to give best effect to the commitment in the programme for Government to develop inclusive and age-appropriate relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE, curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex, LGBTI+, relationships and making appropriate legislative changes, if necessary. The work of the NCCA draws on its Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools, which was published in 2019. As the Deputy will be aware from the Second Stage debate of the Private Members’ Bill tabled by him, arising from recommendations in that report the NCCA has been following a two-track approach on this work. First, the NCCA has a focus on developing support materials for teachers for publication online as part of the online guidance toolkit. The toolkits will support teachers in their engagement with the current SPHE-RSE curriculum in a confident and holistic manner and in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. Separate toolkits, which are being used by schools, are available for the primary, junior cycle and senior cycle curriculum areas. In tandem with this work, the NCCA is progressing the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum, with an initial focus on junior cycle. A draft revised junior cycle specification is due to be agreed at the NCCA council in advance of the summer, with a public consultation to follow. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and rolled out in 2023 and will be followed by revised specifications for senior cycle and primary. In addition to this, I have recently announced the Department's intention to provide funding for a new postgraduate programme to upskill registered post-primary teachers teaching SPHE and RSE. In the course of the programme, it is intended that each participant will be provided with high-quality content knowledge and will be empowered to become an effective and enthusiastic teacher of SPHE-RSE. The Department has recently engaged with higher education institutions and it is hoped that a number of them will be interested in designing and developing this programme. I am keen to allow the NCCA time to complete its development work in this important and sensitive area. This is why, as the Deputy is aware, on Second Stage of the Bill on 16 November, the Government tabled a timed amendment that the motion be read in nine months’ time. My Department continues to engage closely with the NCCA to assist completion of this work.	spk_20
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Legislative Programme	dbsect_6	I acknowledge the Deputy's personal engagement with this issue. I also acknowledge we have made significant progress in progressing this. As I have articulated, I can point to the fact that specifications for junior cycle are due to be published very shortly, followed by public consultation, which has marked this process. At the same time, preparation has begun for senior cycle and we are also looking at the revision at primary level. It is equally important to say that all children and young people have a right to access correct and factual information. That is an absolute given. Equally, as part of my intention to advance this, we are doing all that we can to ensure teachers will be properly trained in all areas so there will be what the Deputy called continuity across all schools. I am rolling out the upskilling programme for teachers, which is covered through funding by the Department. As I said, there is an absolute commitment to allowing the work of the NCCA to progress and to read the Bill again in nine months' time.	spk_22

In anticipation of that, we have very clearly set out the process to ensure our curricula are as current, up to date and appropriate as is necessary and possible. The work is ongoing, which I appreciate the Deputy referenced. While the work is being completed in updating and reviewing the present curriculum, we have ensured we are putting in place a variety of supports for our schools that can be drawn down by our school staff. We are now putting a postgraduate programme in place, the cost of which will be covered by the Department, that will be open to our schools to ensure our staff are fully trained. As I said, there is an absolute commitment to advance this in as timely a manner as we possibly can.We have made significant progress. I am committed to ensuring that is completed.	spk_24

The project for Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers is included in the Department’s construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan as part of the Project Ireland 2040 framework. Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately €4.4 billion in capital investment over the period from 2021 to 2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high-quality building projects with a real focus on sustainability for school communities across Ireland. This investment will build on the good progress being made in adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050. The brief for this project for Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers is the development of a new 16-classroom Gaelscoil with two classrooms for pupils with special educational needs and all associated site works on the site adjacent to the current school at Farranferris in Cork city. The major building project will be delivered under the Department's ADAPT programme. ADAPT is an acronym for the accelerated delivery of architectural planning and tendering. The ADAPT programme uses a professional external project manager to co-ordinate and drive the design team to achieve the best possible timeframe for the project through the stages of architectural planning to tender and construction. The tender process to appoint a project manager will be completed this week. Once appointed, the project manager will commence the tender process for the appointment of a design team for each of the projects on this ADAPT programme, including a design team for Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers. The Department will keep the school authorities informed of the progression of these appointments as they proceed.	spk_48

For example, since 2013, the Department has provided funding to BeLonG To for StandUp! Awareness which is a campaign that supports school communities to take a stand against bullying that is homophobic, transphobic or biphobic. The Deputy observed that there are issues other than bullying but it is all part of creating a good atmosphere in schools. The campaign also seeks to raise awareness in schools about the experience of LGBTQI+ students. The Department has also collaborated with advocacy bodies and partners to prepare a resource document for schools to support LGBTQI+ students, which has been made available online and to schools. The action plan on bullying and the anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools set out the Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. As the Deputy is aware, the Department has recently commenced a review of the action plan and the anti-bullying procedures that will take account of research and developments since they were published. It will specifically consider cyberbullying, identity bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas. Access to RSE is an important right for students, as was referenced earlier, and it is important that the social personal health education, SPHE, and RSE programmes in place in our schools are relevant, up-to-date and inclusive of all our students and staff. This is reflected in the programme for Government commitment to develop inclusive and age appropriate RSE and SPHE curricula. Following an extensive review of the RSE curriculum, focusing on a range of topics including healthy positive sexual expression and relationships and LGBTQI+ matters, the NCCA published the Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools. I earlier outlined to the Deputy the progress we are making in that regard, particularly in respect of the specifications for the junior cycle that will be published imminently, followed by public consultation and roll-out into our schools. In tandem, preparation work is under way for similar reviews of the senior cycle and at primary level. Specifically in terms of staff, it is also worth noting that under employment law, employers, including schools, have a duty to ensure the health and safety of their employees in the workplace as set out in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.	spk_56

The Department offers an employee assistance service for all school staff, including LGBTQI+ employees. This free service includes a wide range of supports including a confidential 24/7 helpline, short-term counselling, a wellbeing portal, webinars, podcasts and blogs.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Ukraine War	dbsect_8	I thank the Deputies, who have raised a variety of points. Deputy Gannon mentioned the fact that if you cannot see it, you cannot be it. I am hugely supportive of achieving the greatest diversity possible within our schools for the benefit of our school communities, our students and our staff. I recently attended the graduation in Marino of migrant teachers. It has been a phenomenally successful programme through which we are getting the best of experience and diversity to enrich our schools. I intend to support and progress that as much as possible to the benefit of our staff, students and schools. Deputy Ó Laoghaire asked about divestment. He will be aware that we have already rolled out a significant pilot programme to promote divestment in our schools. That was born of a lot of engagement and consultation with all of the stakeholders. I am optimistic. We are already seeing how well that is progressing in terms of independent mediation. As I have already said, we are progressing a new RSE curriculum at pace. We are looking initially at the publication of specifications for the junior cycle. The preparatory work for a similar programme for the senior cycle and at primary level is under way. There is an absolute commitment to advancing new curricula.	spk_62
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Ukraine War	dbsect_8	School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year more than 121,400 children, including in excess of 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported every day to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of more than €289 million in 2021. Under the terms of the school transport schemes, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post-primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school or education centre as determined by the Department or Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language. As the Deputy is aware, the Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, how it operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs and the primary and post-primary school transport schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operates, including eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes. The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that also use transport services. Following commencement of this review, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report in June 2021. Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021-22 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second-nearest school and had applied and paid on time. Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is under way. The technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation over recent months, including running a public survey for parents and guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to do so.  The group has also consulted a broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments.	spk_71
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Ukraine War	dbsect_8	I say to the Deputy that facts are facts and they remain as facts, irrespective of the timeframe. Significant progress has been made. The Deputy will be aware, for example, that last year as an interim measure, eligibility criteria were adjusted.Rather than eligibility revolving around the nearest school, I put in place measures so that students would be facilitated if they were opting to go to their second-nearest school. This has alleviated quite considerably many of the difficulties that heretofore had been experienced. To be fair, I believe there has been a general acknowledgement of the importance of this progressive move. The steering group has undertaken extraordinarily efficient public consultation that involved meeting with pupils and parents and consulting the broadest range of stakeholders by actively seeking their opinions so we could have a system in place that would meet the demands of the time in terms of climate and the demands of the time in terms of capacity for students. That work is nearing completion.	spk_73

I am glad there is an acknowledgement that the improvements made in the interim, and particularly around the second-nearest school, have considerably helped with access. I was asked a direct question about the measures for the 2022-23 school year. They will be announced imminently. The work of the review group is continuing apace, but it is my intention that in the shortest timeframe possible, very shortly, I will be making an announcement on the measures for the 2022-23 school year. The focus here is to ensure there is flexibility, access and greater ability for people to avail of the school transport system. A specific issue was raised around fuel. The Deputy is correct. The discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are ongoing. It is my hope and expectation that they will conclude as soon as possible. Those discussions are continuing with the Department.	spk_80
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Ukraine War	dbsect_8	I acknowledge first of all the great work that our schools, students, school leaders and staff have done in welcoming Ukrainian children and young people into their communities over the past two months, and the wider society also. I have visited many schools across the length and breadth of the country and I have seen at first hand the professionalism, the care, the welcome and the efforts that have been made to provide a happy and inclusive atmosphere for Ukrainian families. The Department is working to support education provision for arriving children with immediate education needs.  Utilisation of each school’s existing capacity is the most flexible way possible to do that. There is generally good capacity across the country, albeit capacity pressures in some areas are greater than in others. Many resources for teaching, learning and inclusion of Ukrainian pupils have been published to date, including a central repository of information and continuing professional development resources for school leaders and teachers to support cultural and linguistic diversity, which is available at  As the Deputy may be aware, we have set up regional education and language teams, known as REALT, to help to ensure good co-ordination and alignment of supports for Ukrainian children arriving in Ireland.  REALT services are hosted by the 16 regional education and training boards and are staffed by existing regionally-based education support personnel. The primary role of REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures. The initial focus is on assisting families in securing school places when they are ready to engage with the school system. REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support my Department in developing new capacity where required, and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined area. Overall, it is estimated that approximately 25,000 school places at primary level are available, along with some 20,000 places at secondary level. These teams will ensure that clear, accessible information flows are in place between schools, local education support services and national support structures.	spk_84

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_14	School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year more than 121,400 children, including in excess of 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported every day to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of more than €289 million in 2021. Under the terms of the school transport schemes, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post-primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school or education centre as determined by the Department or Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language. As the Deputy is aware, the Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, how it operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs and the primary and post-primary school transport schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operates, including eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes. The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that also use transport services. Following commencement of this review, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report in June 2021. Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021-22 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second-nearest school and had applied and paid on time. Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is under way. The technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation over recent months, including running a public survey for parents and guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to do so.  The group has also consulted a broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments.	spk_71
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_14	I say to the Deputy that facts are facts and they remain as facts, irrespective of the timeframe. Significant progress has been made. The Deputy will be aware, for example, that last year as an interim measure, eligibility criteria were adjusted.Rather than eligibility revolving around the nearest school, I put in place measures so that students would be facilitated if they were opting to go to their second-nearest school. This has alleviated quite considerably many of the difficulties that heretofore had been experienced. To be fair, I believe there has been a general acknowledgement of the importance of this progressive move. The steering group has undertaken extraordinarily efficient public consultation that involved meeting with pupils and parents and consulting the broadest range of stakeholders by actively seeking their opinions so we could have a system in place that would meet the demands of the time in terms of climate and the demands of the time in terms of capacity for students. That work is nearing completion.	spk_73
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_14	I appreciate the interest across the floor from all Deputies in the whole school transport system. It is an issue I am very familiar with, given my constituency. There has been a body of work. I am glad there is an acknowledgement that the improvements made in the interim, and particularly around the second-nearest school, have considerably helped with access. I was asked a direct question about the measures for the 2022-23 school year. They will be announced imminently. The work of the review group is continuing apace, but it is my intention that in the shortest timeframe possible, very shortly, I will be making an announcement on the measures for the 2022-23 school year. The focus here is to ensure there is flexibility, access and greater ability for people to avail of the school transport system. A specific issue was raised around fuel. The Deputy is correct. The discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are ongoing. It is my hope and expectation that they will conclude as soon as possible. Those discussions are continuing with the Department.	spk_80
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Ukraine War	dbsect_15	I acknowledge first of all the great work that our schools, students, school leaders and staff have done in welcoming Ukrainian children and young people into their communities over the past two months, and the wider society also. I have visited many schools across the length and breadth of the country and I have seen at first hand the professionalism, the care, the welcome and the efforts that have been made to provide a happy and inclusive atmosphere for Ukrainian families. The Department is working to support education provision for arriving children with immediate education needs.  Utilisation of each school’s existing capacity is the most flexible way possible to do that. There is generally good capacity across the country, albeit capacity pressures in some areas are greater than in others. Many resources for teaching, learning and inclusion of Ukrainian pupils have been published to date, including a central repository of information and continuing professional development resources for school leaders and teachers to support cultural and linguistic diversity, which is available at  As the Deputy may be aware, we have set up regional education and language teams, known as REALT, to help to ensure good co-ordination and alignment of supports for Ukrainian children arriving in Ireland.  REALT services are hosted by the 16 regional education and training boards and are staffed by existing regionally-based education support personnel. The primary role of REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures. The initial focus is on assisting families in securing school places when they are ready to engage with the school system. REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support my Department in developing new capacity where required, and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined area. Overall, it is estimated that approximately 25,000 school places at primary level are available, along with some 20,000 places at secondary level. These teams will ensure that clear, accessible information flows are in place between schools, local education support services and national support structures.	spk_84

We have ensured that where schools requested additional teaching staff, which could have been teaching staff for additional hours or English as an additional language, or whether they requested furniture or whatever, that has all been put in place. Specifically, in relation to the students-----	spk_86
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-12	dail	33	Ukraine War	dbsect_15	We have put in place REALT teams, which are addressing any needs on the ground, either for schools with whatever issues they might have or indeed if there is an inability to access a place from a student's point of view. It has proven very successful, which I want to acknowledge. These locally based regional teams are aware of the issues within schools. They are open to the principals but also to the families to address any of the needs that need to be met for the students. I acknowledge that schools have done tremendous work on their own but they are being very ably supported by the REALT teams.	spk_88
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-11	dail	33	School Patronage	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which gives me the opportunity to set out for the House the position of second level schools in Killester, Raheny and Clontarf. To plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department of Education divides the country into 314 school planning areas, as the Deputy knows, and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. Where data indicate clearly that additional provision is required at post-primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following options. They are utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools or provision of a new school or schools in the area in question. A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required. This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. The online patronage process system, OPPS, has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents that will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage as well as language of instruction, whether Irish or English, of new schools. Parental preferences, as well as other considerations, such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area, including Irish-medium provision, are key to the decision-making process and to whether at post-primary level a school would take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelcholáiste or whether, if English-medium, the school would include an Irish-medium unit or aonad. Most new post-primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of between 600 and 1,000 students. A lower threshold of 400 students may apply to Gaelcholáisti, having regard to the alternative of establishing an aonad within a school. As the Deputy states, there are currently seven post-primary schools serving the Killester, Raheny and Clontarf school planning area. The Department's most recent projections do not indicate significant increases in school place requirements at post-primary level in this area to the extent that a new school would be required in the short term. Nevertheless, I want to be clear in saying that my Department will continue to work to ensure there is sufficient capacity in the area to meet school place demand and will keep the requirements in the area, as with all other school planning areas, under significant review, as we do on an ongoing basis. Additionally, my Department will continue to liaise with Dublin City Council in respect of its review of the Dublin city development plan with a view to identifying any potential long-term school accommodation requirements.	spk_15
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-05-11	dail	33	School Patronage	dbsect_3	I appreciate we are over time. I thank the Deputy. I would like to clarify that the demographics at post-primary level in the Raheny, Clontarf and Killester school planning area are expected to peak in 2028, with a gradual decline out to 2040. The 2020 enrolment is 3,789 across seven schools, with an expected peak in enrolment at 4,087 in 2028. It is important to note that the patronage process is run after it has been decided that a new school is warranted or required. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences for each patron and in regard to the language of instruction at the school from parents of children who reside in the relevant school planning area, together with the extensive diversity currently available in the area, are key to the decision-making process.  An online patronage process system has been developed by the Department to provide objective information to all parents, which allows them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child's education. The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, namely, the new schools establishment group. I appreciate the points made by the Deputy in terms of those with whom he is working. As I said in my earlier response, I am happy to keep this under review. We do that constantly across all of our school planning areas. We work with the information as it comes on stream, either through the local authorities in terms of development plans or whatever the case might be. We are very proactive in this space. I am happy to confirm again that we keep everything under review.	spk_18

I acknowledge the terrific work that is being done on the ground in terms of meeting the needs and the challenges. I have had the opportunity to visit a number of schools throughout the country. I visited Trinity Comprehensive School, Ballymun recently. The welcome, inclusion and effort that is being put in place by school communities is second to none.

All of the key agencies working together in a holistic manner will bring added value and efficiencies to the process of supporting young people and children from the Ukraine. The teams will initially focus on ensuring that children find school places when they are ready to engage with the school system. The utilisation of capacity within existing schools across the country will be a very important aspect for addressing the need for education provision for Ukrainian children.

The Department will be engaging further with schools and education partners to supplement this data.Additionally, the Department is currently working to put arrangements in place to share all of this available information on school capacity with the REALT. The spatial analysis facilitated by the Department's GIS supports the production of capacity reports to help the REALT to identify potential local school take-on capacity, based on a given geographical location, such as an accommodation centre. Reports will include data on schools within ranges of travel distances from that identified centre. This facility is expected to be available to the REALT shortly. TESS will work with all local providers on an ongoing basis to ensure that children and young people are enrolled in school as soon as possible. As part of the process to ensure this, TESS will receive information on families with children of schoolgoing age in different locations. TESS will play a key role in identifying school places through linking with local schools as part of the REALT and in working collaboratively across all Departments and agencies to identify and remove all barriers to school attendance.

DEIS is the main policy initiative of my Department to tackle educational disadvantage at school level. Schools in the programme avail of a range of targeted supports aimed at tackling educational disadvantage, including additional classroom teaching posts, home-school community liaison co-ordinator posts, DEIS grant funding and access to the school completion programme. On 9 March, I was pleased to announce the expansion of the DEIS programme. This will see the programme extended to an additional 310 schools. In addition, 37 existing DEIS schools are being reclassified and are eligible for increased supports. These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage. This now means that in the 2022-23 school year, there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS programme, 960 of which are in primary and 234 in post-primary.  From next September, more than 240,000 students, or nearly one in four students, will be supported in the programme. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme, and it will extend DEIS status to schools that are serving the highest proportions of pupils at a risk of educational disadvantage. From 2023, the Department will spend in the region of €180 million on the DEIS programme. This is an increase of €32 million. This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated level of disadvantage in schools. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model, which is an objective statistics-based model. The model was applied equally to all schools. The model uses address information that schools provide under their annual returns to the Department. These addresses were then combined with the Pobal HP deprivation index, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. The HP index divides the country into approximately 18,500 small areas, with approximately 100 dwellings in each. The refined DEIS identification model being applied to schools in 2022 builds on the objectivity and fairness of the 2017 version, but now captures a greater breadth of disadvantage and accounts for severity of disadvantage through the application of a weighted process. The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students who are residing in direct provision or students who are residing in emergency homeless accommodation. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme. The model has been fairly and equally applied to all schools. To ensure all schools are treated equally and fairly, those that have not been included in the programme at this time will have an opportunity to have the decision reviewed.

The HP deprivation index, as employed by the DEIS model, is also employed in a number of Departments, including the Departments of Justice, Health and Social Protection. The tool measures relative advantage or disadvantage. There are 18,500 small areas of approximately 100 dwellings, and the purpose is to identify not individual deprivation but pockets of deprivation, that is, what is called cumulative disadvantage. It has been acknowledged in both national and international studies that, where there is an accumulation of disadvantage in an area, that is an even more significant disadvantage to a student. It is for that purpose that we have this model in order that targeted interventions can take place where there is cumulative disadvantage. The data that were relied on are the same data, as the Deputy mentioned, from the primary online database, POD, and the post-primary online database, PPOD, identical for all school data, and they were combined with the HP deprivation index.

The HP deprivation index, as employed by the DEIS model, is also employed in a number of Departments, including the Departments of Justice, Health and Social Protection. The tool measures relative advantage or disadvantage. There are 18,500 small areas of approximately 100 dwellings, and the purpose is to identify not individual deprivation but pockets of deprivation, that is, what is called cumulative disadvantage. It has been acknowledged in both national and international studies that, where there is an accumulation of disadvantage in an area, that is an even more significant disadvantage to a student. It is for that purpose that we have this model in order that targeted interventions can take place where there is cumulative disadvantage. The data that were relied on are the same data, as the Deputy mentioned, from the primary online database, POD, and the post-primary online database, PPOD, identical for all school data, and they were combined with the HP deprivation index. The weightings the Deputy mentioned are in the POD------	spk_263
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_17	I was very pleased yesterday to be able to announce a major expansion of the DEIS programme. For the first time, we are now seeing a considerable expansion of the programme, which will mean that a significant number of schools will benefit from the €32 million investment. In fact, it will mean that 310 schools will be provided for in the DEIS programme, which will mean that 25% of our schools are part of the programme, facilitating almost 250,000 or one in four students. Currently, 884 schools and more than 180,000 students benefit from the DEIS programme. As I said, the additions are significant in terms of moving that forward. Supports will be provided to these schools, including a DEIS grant and additional schoolbook grant funding, access to the home school community liaison scheme, access to the school completion programme and priority access to continuous professional development for teachers. Schools have been identified for inclusion in the programme, and this is important, through the refined DEIS identification model, which is an objective, statistics-based model. This model uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP deprivation index. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. The extension of the DEIS programme to additional schools follows intensive work by the DEIS technical group, which involved valuable input from stakeholders. The refined DEIS identification model builds on the objectivity and fairness of the 2017 version, but now captures a greater breadth of disadvantage and accounts for severity of disadvantage through the application of a weighted process. It also takes consideration of the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Using this approach, we can extend the additional targeted supports of the DEIS programme to those schools serving high concentrations of students at risk of educational disadvantage.	spk_107
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_17	I want to finish on the appeals process. I acknowledge that many schools were very pleased yesterday. The Deputy was gracious enough to include a reference to the schools in his constituency. I also appreciate there were schools that did not make the DEIS status yesterday. I want to be very clear that the model employed, that is, the Pobal HP deprivation index, is very clear and transparent in respect of categorising what we are talking about or referring to in terms of compounded disadvantage, which highlights those schools where the greatest level of disadvantage is being experienced. Those were the schools that were successful yesterday. Notwithstanding that, there will almost certainly be an appeals process. The Department is committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which they have been assessed for inclusion in the programme. If a school considers that it should have been identified for inclusion in the programme under the refined model, an appeals process has been developed to allow it to seek a review. That will be forthcoming in the next few weeks.	spk_109
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_17	I thank the Deputy. I want to be very clear at the outset that the consultation actually predated me.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_17	I am not finished yet. I gave an absolute commitment to the Deputy that he would be fully briefed in advance of me making any public announcement in relation to DEIS. That was facilitated yesterday. It was facilitated by experts and by officials from my own Department. Indeed, I was there also. On the availability of information, every step of the way the information has been made available through parliamentary questions, etc. about the model and the work that was ongoing at that time. In fairness, we have benefited greatly from the stakeholder engagements with the managerial bodies and the teaching unions, etc. in the entire process. In fairness, in terms of all the other operations in the Department of Education, the Deputy has been involved.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_17	The Department provides a book grant to all recognised primary and post-primary schools within the free education system in order to provide assistance for books, including book rental schemes. Under this scheme, my Department provided funding of €17.2 million in 2021 to all of these schools. Schools that are participating in the Department's DEIS programme receive an enhanced rate of book grant. Schoolbook rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of schoolbooks for parents and guardians. In order to support the establishment of book rental schemes, the Department provided €15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to all primary schools. From the information available to the Department, approximately 96% of all primary schools and 69% of all post-primary schools currently operate a book rental scheme. It is a matter for the board of management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book rent funding in the school. Schools are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those students most in need. Additional funding of €1 million was provided for in budget 2020 to provide free books in DEIS primary schools on a pilot basis. This funding was allocated to 102 DEIS primary schools for a pilot programme for the 2020-21 school year. This funding continued for the 2021-22 school year. The aim of this pilot is to provide free schoolbooks for students in the schools involved and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of schoolbooks for parents. It will continue to run for the 2021-22 school year. Its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made regarding its possible extension or continuation. It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible. Under circular 46/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of €21 per pupil, which is important to note as well. We have seen that the present pilot has been successful. Indeed, it is important to us that we would take the opportunity to evaluate its strengths, and consider where we might be able to improve, prior to taking any further action.	spk_120
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_17	Again, I want to say very clearly that many of the points the Deputy makes are being acknowledged by the Department. There is a strong vision within the Department. Hence, we have a very significant roll-out of the pilot scheme. It is only right and proper that before we would advance, we would have a significant pilot in place and we would have an opportunity to evaluate it so we can see where we are at. Equally, in terms of the breadth of vision in the Department, I am very pleased to say that there was a €20 million allocation in the budget this year to provide for free books or resources for reading within our schools. This is significant. It is the first time we have done such an initiative. It underpins the value of reading and access to the power of language and words in whatever type of book might appeal to a child, whether it is poetry, artistic or whatever the case might be. There is a strong commitment to the provision of supports for children’s textbooks or reading books in the school environment. This is being supported financially by the Department.	spk_122
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_17	I reiterate that the pilot runs for this school year.

In conjunction with that, we will roll out €20 million into our schools to make additional books and reading supports available in our schools. There is a significant book rental scheme. I know the Deputy has not taken the value of that on board. I think it is a significant resource for our schools. There is a book rental scheme also. It is operating-----	spk_125

It is actually being supported by the Department of Education from a financial point of view as well. I want to be clear that there is no single measure being offered within the schools. There is a multiplicity of measures and supports being provided. There is a wide breadth of vision in terms of how to support our families and our children going forward.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_17	Access to sexual and health education is an important right for students, and it is equally important that this education meets the needs of students in their day-to-day lives and reflect best practice. The Department continues to work closely with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to give effect to the commitment in the programme for Government to develop inclusive and age-appropriate relationship and sexual education, RSE, and social, political and health education, SPHE, curriculums at primary and post-primary levels, including through an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships and making appropriate legislative changes, if necessary. The NCCA draws on the report on the review of relationships and sexuality education in primary and post-primary schools, which was published in December 2019. As the Deputy will be aware from the Second Stage debate on the Private Members’ Bill he tabled, arising from recommendations in that report, the NCCA has been following a twin-track approach in this work. First, the NCCA has a focus on developing support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an online guidance toolkit. The toolkit supports teachers in their engagement with the current SPHE-RSE curriculum in a confident and holistic manner, and in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. Separate toolkits, which are being used by schools, are available for the primary, junior cycle and senior cycle curriculum areas.  In tandem with this work on the online toolkits, the NCCA is progressing the broader redevelopment and update of the SPHE curriculum, with an initial focus on the junior cycle. The Department is also examining means to support teachers through the provision of enhanced continuing professional development, CPD. A review of the current junior cycle SPHE course has been approved by the NCCA and forms the basis for the work of the subject development groups in formulating an updated junior cycle SPHE specification. A draft revised junior cycle specification is due to be agreed by the NCCA in advance of the summer, with a public consultation to follow. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and rolled out in schools from September 2023. Preparatory work will commence in 2022 in respect of senior cycle specifications as the next area of focus.	spk_135
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_17	As I outlined earlier and as was outlined during the debate on the Bill, it is important that the NCCA, which has undertaken a significant body of work on specifications for the junior cycle this year, moving ahead with the senior cycle subsequently, be given time to complete the development work in this significant area.That is why, on Second Stage of the Bill, as the Deputy will be aware, Government tabled a timed amendment that the motion be read in nine months. The Department will continue to work closely with the NCCA to assist in completion of this work as a matter of priority. I made clear at the time I am absolutely committed to this being delivered as a matter of priority. It is important, as I have articulated, that students have the information available. It is the right of every student to have the information available to him or her. It is also important that we are conscious of models of best practice. Indeed, in terms of the work of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, the Deputy will be aware that a cross-departmental approach is being taken and the Department of Education very much will be involved in all of that.	spk_137
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_17	The NCCA has taken the broadest view of models of best practice in terms of the information that should be available to the students. I reiterate there is absolute clarity and commitment on the part of the Department. Indeed, there is recognition on all sides of the importance of the correct and factual information being not only made available to but readily accessed by the students. In tandem with that, it is important that the school staff are supported in the delivery of it. When we talk about various approaches, we are talking about not only the curriculum but also adequate and significant supports being available for the delivery of the curriculum. Underlying and underpinning everything that is in the curriculum, at the heart of it will be meeting the needs and the challenges that children and young people face today and that they would have the information. In terms of working with other Department, I reiterate there is an absolute commitment on our part to work on a cross-departmental level. Whether with the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, we will take that collaborative and co-operative approach.	spk_139

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	As the Deputy will be aware, the school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the current school year, more than 121,400 students, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of more than €289 million in 2021. I know what a hugely important service school transport is for families and children. As the Deputy referenced, my Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure it serves students and their families adequately. The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs and the primary and post-primary school transport schemes in terms of how each element of the scheme currently operates to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes. The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that also use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting, where possible, initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school. In June 2021, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next-nearest school. Following consideration of the report, I approved alleviation measures that allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time. Wider considerations relating to the operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review. As part of this phase, the Department has conducted an extensive stakeholder engagement process. The Department is analysing the views of relevant stakeholders, including parents, guardians, students and other Departments, so that they may be considered as part of the assessment and in informing policy on the future operation of the scheme.	spk_147
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	With regard to engagement, following the announcement of the commencement of the stakeholder consultation process in January 2022, a very proactive approach was taken by the Department. There was direct contact with stakeholders, including school management bodies, parent representative organisations, special education interest groups, EU member states, and school principals, to seek their views on the school transport scheme. Parents and guardians and post-primary students were also invited to complete online surveys. More than 8,200 surveys have been received from parents and guardians and more than 2,400 surveys have been received from students, which is significant engagement by students in the process. To date, five submissions have been received from other Departments and organisations, six from school management bodies, 73 from school principals, and submissions have also been received from special education interest groups and broader interests. Ongoing engagement continues between officials in my Department and others. We hope to expedite the completion of the review on school transport as quickly as possible.	spk_149
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	To be very clear, there is no ambiguity as regards the Department's ambition. We are very clear that it is our intention to advance the school transport system. We have listed a variety of criteria regarding eligibility and encouraging people to access school transport, but also to pursue a green agenda in terms of accessibility.

New specifications in junior cycle science and business studies were introduced in August 2016 and first examined in 2019. The new specifications for the modern foreign languages and Irish were introduced in August 2017 and were due for assessment for the first time in 2020. Junior cycle geography, history, home economics, music and mathematics were introduced in schools in 2018 and were due for assessment in 2021. The State Examinations Commission published sample papers in autumn 2021 for the subjects in the fifth and final phase of junior cycle reform, which will be examined for the first time in 2022. These are religious education, classics, wood technology, engineering, graphics and applied technology. While all new specifications are now being taught in schools, due to the pandemic, the junior cycle examinations in both 2020 and 2021 were not held for school-based candidates. The majority of new specifications will, therefore, be examined, at scale, for the first time in 2022. The SEC advises that, as has long been the case at junior cycle level, the level of detail on examination papers relating to mark allocations may vary from subject to subject. In some cases, mark allocations are shown for questions, sections or the entire paper, and some papers provide guidance as to the length of time to be spent on particular questions. It is important to note that these are no-choice examination papers and candidates are required to answer all questions on the examination paper. In addition, the examination papers are in a completion booklet format, and the space provided for the candidate responses provides an indication to candidates of the length of the response required. The structure and format of the papers are of assistance to teachers in preparing candidates in their preparation for the examinations. In line with long-standing practice, and in the interests of fairness, the SEC does not provide marking schemes for sample papers as the marking scheme cannot be finalised in the absence of a review of candidate work produced under live examination conditions. The SEC advises that it would not be appropriate to draw any inferences from any marking scheme for a sample paper regarding how any subsequent live paper might be marked. The SEC will publish the marking schemes at the time of issue of the provisional examination results. This can assist candidates who are considering whether they may wish to appeal these provisional results, and provides clarity to candidates and their teachers regarding how the work produced was evaluated.	spk_154

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. For the current school year, the staffing schedule operates on a general average of 25 pupils to every one teacher. That is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level. More favourable ratios are implemented for DEIS urban band 1 schools. Budget 2022 progressed the ongoing major investment in our primary education sector which impacts positively on the staffing in primary schools by providing a further one-point reduction for the 2022-23 school year so that primary schools will be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of one classroom teacher for every 24 pupils in September 2022. This brings the staffing schedule to a further new historical low for primary schools.  Budget 2022 also provided the largest-ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme with an additional allocation of €18 million, equivalent to a full year allocation of €32 million, which will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools. This will result in an increase of more than 20% in funding for the DEIS programme.  In addition, nearly 1,000 extra special education teachers will be provided to increase capacity for supporting children in special classes, special schools and mainstream settings. Schools with at least two special classes will be provided with an administrative principal, while release days for teaching principals will be maintained. The staffing schedule for the 2022-23 school year is being finalised and will be published in the coming weeks. The Deputy will appreciate that with 4,000 schools, significant work is involved. I appreciate the need to expedite it. The Department is working on it and it will be published as expeditiously as possible. The timeframe is in the coming weeks.	spk_168

I am very conscious of the ongoing work as we, hopefully, journey out of Covid. All the necessary additional supports to manage infection prevention and control in our schools have been maintained. Notwithstanding those resources and additionalities, they pale into insignificance when considering the sheer goodwill and workload provided in our schools every day from our school staff, school leaders and the students themselves. The commitment is that the schedule will be available in the coming weeks. I cannot give the Deputy a definitive date. We are working as quickly as we can and giving priority to the staffing schedule but it takes time.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	A cross-government, interdepartmental approach is being taken on this. We are clear that families, children and young people from Ukraine are welcome and we will do all that is necessary to support them. I met the Ukrainian ambassador yesterday, as the Deputy will be aware. I also spoke online with the Ukrainian minister for education. The details he shared were very upsetting and harrowing. Some 250 schools and education institutions have been bombed and he said that there would be more to come. Our schools will be open and welcoming.Last week I visited a school that already had a Ukrainian student in it. I spoke to principals over the weekend. One informed me of a family who arrived into his community on Friday and had children in the school on the Monday. Notwithstanding that, English as an additional language, EAL, is a significant support. We will absolutely put in place all the resources we need to. This is a time of emergency and challenge. Any humanitarian support this country can offer the Ukrainian people will be given.	spk_173
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	I thank the Deputy. To plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, GIS, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places throughout the country will arise. With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. This information provides a degree of certainty in projecting demand in an area in future years. Where an additional school place demand is identified, the need can be met by one or more of the following options, namely, utilising spare capacity in existing schools, expansion of existing schools or establishment of a new school. In that assessment of appropriate solutions, the Department considers a national inventory of school capacity that is completed by individual schools. When schools are providing their annual 30 September enrolment returns to the Department in respect of the primary online database for primary schools and post-primary online database for post-primary schools, they are now also requested to provide information in respect of overall demand for school places and available capacity within their schools. The compilation and analysis of this information at local, regional and national level through the Department's GIS is an important additional feature of the school planning process. As the Deputy will be aware, the Department currently has a requirement to identify a permanent site to accommodate the 1,000-pupil capacity Galway Educate Together post-primary school that was established in 2019 to serve the Galway city and Oranmore school planning areas as a regional solution. The site identification exercise for this school requirement found there were no suitable available vacant school buildings that would meet the long-term accommodation needs of the new school. The Department did, as the Deputy has referenced, make progress on that. The Department also has building projects at primary, post-primary and special schools across Galway city and county, including new school buildings for St. Joseph's College in Galway city, Scoil Chaitríona Junior and Senior Schools, Cuan na Gaillimhe Community National School, Rosedale Special School, Scoil Mhuire, Moycullen and St. Teresa's Special School, among others. There are also multiple large and small scale extension projects in train across the county.	spk_175

While no such properties were identified-----	spk_177
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	I appreciate the Deputy's commitment to the provision of appropriate capacity in the Galway area. I want to be very clear the Department is being proactive here. There was a positive announcement yesterday. In an ideal world we would be able to source permanent sites almost overnight. That is not the case. There are significant difficulties. Every site identified as having potential absolutely is evaluated by the Department. Particular time and consideration is given to evaluating every aspect of the site, including whether it is suitable not just for current needs but projected ones going forward, whether there is a planning issue or a road issue and so on. The Deputy herself knows there are a whole variety of considerations that must be taken into account. We are committed to advancing and have made progress. We will continue to deliberate as a matter of urgency on finding appropriate spare capacity going forward.	spk_180
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	Again, I want to be clear when a property becomes available, the Department will engage with the property owner, as it is right and proper. When a site becomes available, the Department will engage and do a full evaluation of the site. It will evaluate the site's positives, negatives and its potential going forward. All of that is a time consideration. Specifically on the matter of properties being available, if the property is not in the Department's ownership, then obviously arrangements need to be made with the property owner. Our key priority is to ensure there is provision of appropriate space for our students, staff and school community. As I referenced earlier, it is not always easy to find an appropriate site, that is, one that will meet not just the current demands but also the future ones. Thus, in some instances we must make short-term arrangements to facilitate a longer or greater vision we have going forward. In this instance we are doing that but we ultimately have the longer objective and longer view of providing a permanent site.	spk_184
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	I wish to be clear regarding the leaving certificate and junior cycle classes of 2022. Significant accommodations have already been made on the papers for leaving certificate students, and equally so in respect of junior cycle students. We are looking at classroom-based assessments being cut by 50% and the assessment task being removed so as to allow for greater contact time in the classroom and a strong well-being approach. I acknowledge that this approach is being taken by all schools in supporting their students - not just their exam students, who are important in this context, but the entire school community. This approach is being well supported throughout our schools.	spk_193
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_23	I can assure the Deputy that it is the policy of my Department to ensure a high standard of permanent accommodation for all schools. However, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population over the past decade or more, it is sometimes necessary to put in place interim accommodation solutions to meet the needs of schools. Given the timeframes for the acquisition of suitable sites, design, statutory planning processes, tendering and construction, it is often necessary for newly-established schools to commence operation in such interim accommodation. Since 2011, 117 new primary, post-primary and special schools have been established by the Department of Education. Of these, 51 are already operating in their permanent accommodation. The projects to deliver permanent accommodation for the remaining schools are at various stages of planning and construction. The Deputy has requested a breakdown of these by status and county in tabular form and I have arranged for my officials to provide the requested details directly to her office in due course. In relation to the acquisition of permanent sites, the Deputy will appreciate that the site acquisition process is very complex and subject to completion of successful negotiation and conveyancing processes. Each acquisition is unique and dependent on multiple factors, many of which may be outside of the control of the Department of Education. The Deputy will also appreciate the importance of conducting a thorough appraisal of site options before proceeding with an acquisition in order to obtain best value for the Exchequer. While the site acquisition can necessarily take some time, I can assure the Deputy that the Department is working to progress all site acquisitions as quickly as possible. It is important to note that of the 117 new schools established since 2011, only six do not yet have their permanent site identification. Once the Department has certainty on the permanent site for a school the project for the new school building is progressed to the architectural planning process as quickly as possible. Approximately 1,200 school building projects under the Department's large-scale and additional accommodation scheme are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction, most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025. There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction, with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage. These are being progressed as quickly as possible. 	spk_200
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_24	As the Deputy will be aware, the school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the current school year, more than 121,400 students, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of more than €289 million in 2021. I know what a hugely important service school transport is for families and children. As the Deputy referenced, my Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure it serves students and their families adequately. The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs and the primary and post-primary school transport schemes in terms of how each element of the scheme currently operates to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes. The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that also use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting, where possible, initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school. In June 2021, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next-nearest school. Following consideration of the report, I approved alleviation measures that allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time. Wider considerations relating to the operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review. As part of this phase, the Department has conducted an extensive stakeholder engagement process. The Department is analysing the views of relevant stakeholders, including parents, guardians, students and other Departments, so that they may be considered as part of the assessment and in informing policy on the future operation of the scheme.	spk_147
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_24	With regard to engagement, following the announcement of the commencement of the stakeholder consultation process in January 2022, a very proactive approach was taken by the Department. There was direct contact with stakeholders, including school management bodies, parent representative organisations, special education interest groups, EU member states, and school principals, to seek their views on the school transport scheme. Parents and guardians and post-primary students were also invited to complete online surveys. More than 8,200 surveys have been received from parents and guardians and more than 2,400 surveys have been received from students, which is significant engagement by students in the process. To date, five submissions have been received from other Departments and organisations, six from school management bodies, 73 from school principals, and submissions have also been received from special education interest groups and broader interests. Ongoing engagement continues between officials in my Department and others. We hope to expedite the completion of the review on school transport as quickly as possible.	spk_149

We are very clear that it is our intention to advance the school transport system. We have listed a variety of criteria regarding eligibility and encouraging people to access school transport, but also to pursue a green agenda in terms of accessibility. We have moved a step forward even in the short term in accessing availability for students who are not necessarily attending their nearest school but their next-nearest school. We continue apace.

That also gives confidence to the project. We have made significant progress and I want us to continue with the same level of urgency and priority.	spk_166
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_27	The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. For the current school year, the staffing schedule operates on a general average of 25 pupils to every one teacher. That is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level. More favourable ratios are implemented for DEIS urban band 1 schools. Budget 2022 progressed the ongoing major investment in our primary education sector which impacts positively on the staffing in primary schools by providing a further one-point reduction for the 2022-23 school year so that primary schools will be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of one classroom teacher for every 24 pupils in September 2022. This brings the staffing schedule to a further new historical low for primary schools.  Budget 2022 also provided the largest-ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme with an additional allocation of €18 million, equivalent to a full year allocation of €32 million, which will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools. This will result in an increase of more than 20% in funding for the DEIS programme.  In addition, nearly 1,000 extra special education teachers will be provided to increase capacity for supporting children in special classes, special schools and mainstream settings. Schools with at least two special classes will be provided with an administrative principal, while release days for teaching principals will be maintained. The staffing schedule for the 2022-23 school year is being finalised and will be published in the coming weeks. The Deputy will appreciate that with 4,000 schools, significant work is involved. I appreciate the need to expedite it. The Department is working on it and it will be published as expeditiously as possible. The timeframe is in the coming weeks.	spk_168
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_27	I appreciate the work that is ongoing in our schools. I visit schools regularly and meet principals, staff, students and school communities, boards of management and parents. I am very conscious of the ongoing work as we, hopefully, journey out of Covid. All the necessary additional supports to manage infection prevention and control in our schools have been maintained. Notwithstanding those resources and additionalities, they pale into insignificance when considering the sheer goodwill and workload provided in our schools every day from our school staff, school leaders and the students themselves. The commitment is that the schedule will be available in the coming weeks. I cannot give the Deputy a definitive date. We are working as quickly as we can and giving priority to the staffing schedule but it takes time.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_27	A cross-government, interdepartmental approach is being taken on this. We are clear that families, children and young people from Ukraine are welcome and we will do all that is necessary to support them. I met the Ukrainian ambassador yesterday, as the Deputy will be aware. I also spoke online with the Ukrainian minister for education. The details he shared were very upsetting and harrowing. Some 250 schools and education institutions have been bombed and he said that there would be more to come. Our schools will be open and welcoming.Last week I visited a school that already had a Ukrainian student in it. I spoke to principals over the weekend. One informed me of a family who arrived into his community on Friday and had children in the school on the Monday. Notwithstanding that, English as an additional language, EAL, is a significant support. We will absolutely put in place all the resources we need to. This is a time of emergency and challenge. Any humanitarian support this country can offer the Ukrainian people will be given.	spk_173
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_28	I thank the Deputy. To plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, GIS, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places throughout the country will arise. With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. This information provides a degree of certainty in projecting demand in an area in future years. Where an additional school place demand is identified, the need can be met by one or more of the following options, namely, utilising spare capacity in existing schools, expansion of existing schools or establishment of a new school. In that assessment of appropriate solutions, the Department considers a national inventory of school capacity that is completed by individual schools. When schools are providing their annual 30 September enrolment returns to the Department in respect of the primary online database for primary schools and post-primary online database for post-primary schools, they are now also requested to provide information in respect of overall demand for school places and available capacity within their schools. The compilation and analysis of this information at local, regional and national level through the Department's GIS is an important additional feature of the school planning process. As the Deputy will be aware, the Department currently has a requirement to identify a permanent site to accommodate the 1,000-pupil capacity Galway Educate Together post-primary school that was established in 2019 to serve the Galway city and Oranmore school planning areas as a regional solution. The site identification exercise for this school requirement found there were no suitable available vacant school buildings that would meet the long-term accommodation needs of the new school. The Department did, as the Deputy has referenced, make progress on that. The Department also has building projects at primary, post-primary and special schools across Galway city and county, including new school buildings for St. Joseph's College in Galway city, Scoil Chaitríona Junior and Senior Schools, Cuan na Gaillimhe Community National School, Rosedale Special School, Scoil Mhuire, Moycullen and St. Teresa's Special School, among others. There are also multiple large and small scale extension projects in train across the county.	spk_175

While no such properties were identified-----	spk_177
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_28	I appreciate the Deputy's commitment to the provision of appropriate capacity in the Galway area. I want to be very clear the Department is being proactive here. There was a positive announcement yesterday. In an ideal world we would be able to source permanent sites almost overnight. That is not the case. There are significant difficulties. Every site identified as having potential absolutely is evaluated by the Department. Particular time and consideration is given to evaluating every aspect of the site, including whether it is suitable not just for current needs but projected ones going forward, whether there is a planning issue or a road issue and so on. The Deputy herself knows there are a whole variety of considerations that must be taken into account. We are committed to advancing and have made progress. We will continue to deliberate as a matter of urgency on finding appropriate spare capacity going forward.	spk_180
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_28	Again, I want to be clear when a property becomes available, the Department will engage with the property owner, as it is right and proper. When a site becomes available, the Department will engage and do a full evaluation of the site. It will evaluate the site's positives, negatives and its potential going forward. All of that is a time consideration. Specifically on the matter of properties being available, if the property is not in the Department's ownership, then obviously arrangements need to be made with the property owner. Our key priority is to ensure there is provision of appropriate space for our students, staff and school community. As I referenced earlier, it is not always easy to find an appropriate site, that is, one that will meet not just the current demands but also the future ones. Thus, in some instances we must make short-term arrangements to facilitate a longer or greater vision we have going forward. In this instance we are doing that but we ultimately have the longer objective and longer view of providing a permanent site.	spk_184
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_29	I wish to be clear regarding the leaving certificate and junior cycle classes of 2022. Significant accommodations have already been made on the papers for leaving certificate students, and equally so in respect of junior cycle students. We are looking at classroom-based assessments being cut by 50% and the assessment task being removed so as to allow for greater contact time in the classroom and a strong well-being approach. I acknowledge that this approach is being taken by all schools in supporting their students - not just their exam students, who are important in this context, but the entire school community. This approach is being well supported throughout our schools.	spk_193
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_31	I can assure the Deputy that it is the policy of my Department to ensure a high standard of permanent accommodation for all schools. However, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population over the past decade or more, it is sometimes necessary to put in place interim accommodation solutions to meet the needs of schools. Given the timeframes for the acquisition of suitable sites, design, statutory planning processes, tendering and construction, it is often necessary for newly-established schools to commence operation in such interim accommodation. Since 2011, 117 new primary, post-primary and special schools have been established by the Department of Education. Of these, 51 are already operating in their permanent accommodation. The projects to deliver permanent accommodation for the remaining schools are at various stages of planning and construction. The Deputy has requested a breakdown of these by status and county in tabular form and I have arranged for my officials to provide the requested details directly to her office in due course. In relation to the acquisition of permanent sites, the Deputy will appreciate that the site acquisition process is very complex and subject to completion of successful negotiation and conveyancing processes. Each acquisition is unique and dependent on multiple factors, many of which may be outside of the control of the Department of Education. The Deputy will also appreciate the importance of conducting a thorough appraisal of site options before proceeding with an acquisition in order to obtain best value for the Exchequer. While the site acquisition can necessarily take some time, I can assure the Deputy that the Department is working to progress all site acquisitions as quickly as possible. It is important to note that of the 117 new schools established since 2011, only six do not yet have their permanent site identification. Once the Department has certainty on the permanent site for a school the project for the new school building is progressed to the architectural planning process as quickly as possible. Approximately 1,200 school building projects under the Department's large-scale and additional accommodation scheme are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction, most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025. There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction, with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage. These are being progressed as quickly as possible. 	spk_200
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Education (Voluntary Contributions) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_48	"I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after ""That"" and substitute the following: ""Dáil Eireann resolves that the Education (Voluntary Contributions) Bill 2021 be deemed to be read a second time this day nine months to allow for the progression of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 and for that then to be taken into account in the consideration of this Bill."".Táim fíorbhuíoch as an deis mo thuairimí ó thaobh an Bhille a chur os comhair na Dála. I share the Deputy’s desire for greater clarity and transparency for parents and guardians around voluntary contributions and I am supportive of measures which will support and enhance that. While very many schools already provide great clarity to parents and the broader school community around how financial contributions and resources are used within the school, I recognise that further work is needed to ensure that this becomes uniform across the board.I am particularly conscious of the need for this clarity, given the financial pressures which many families find themselves under at present. However it is my strong view that Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 is the correct approach to achieve this goal. The programme for Government contains a commitment to enact the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019. The charter Bill has already been passed by the Seanad and completed Second Stage in the Dáil and now awaits progress to Committee Stage. It is well under way in the legislative process and has received support from many Members of the House and within the broader education sphere in its overall aims and objectives. The overall aim of the charter Bill is to improve the level of engagement between the school community by inviting feedback, comment and observation from students and parents and by further developing a listening culture in schools. One of the key concepts of the Bill is the need for a school to consult students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities. The charter guidelines will set out the form and manner in which information is to be provided to students and parents, which may include publishing information on the school's own website about voluntary contributions and how they are spent. This Bill seeks to require the school to state clearly that any contribution made by parents and guardians toward the operating costs of the school is voluntary and that there is no obligation on parents and guardians to make such a contribution. This is backed up in previous legislation, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which already contains a provision prohibiting the charging of admission and enrolment fees for admission to or for continued enrolment in a school. This Private Members' Bill also proposes that the Department of Education publish details of the total moneys collected annually by schools, as well as details of the expenditure of those moneys. The charter Bill requires schools to prepare, publish and implement a charter in accordance with national guidelines which will be published by me, as Minister for Education, after consultation with unions, management bodies, parents and student representatives. The charter guidelines will set out the financial information that schools must provide to students and their parents. The information provided to students and parents must include information about how the school has spent moneys that it has received, including any funding obtained through fundraising and voluntary contributions. In the charter Bill, I am putting in place an obligation on schools to be transparent in relation to voluntary contributions and to provide key information to parents on the moneys raised and how they have been spent. I am doing this in a structured and clear way as part of a school’s obligations under its own charter. Publishing data that allow for comparison of schools based on moneys raised and spent in a given year without any consideration of context could be misleading for parents and unfair to the schools concerned. For example, such comparisons would not reflect the difference between a school that consistently seeks high levels of contributions and a school that in a given year or for a short period is raising funds for a particular project or facility but typically does not seek or raise significant amounts from parents. I believe the approach taken in the charter Bill in this regard is clear, fair and balanced and will not be unduly burdensome for schools. On the broader context of the funding of our schools, as raised by the Deputy, I know that our schools and our education system can only prosper with the right supports and the right investment. We are fortunate in Ireland to have teaching and school staff of an extremely high quality and to enjoy the support and commitment of many volunteers from board of management members to parent representatives to local community members. This must be accompanied and reinforced by strong State investment in schools and their communities. That is why I have, as Minister for Education, prioritised successive funding increases for our schools through the last two budgets. For example, yesterday I announced a €32 million investment in the DEIS programme, which provides targeted and tailored supports for students at greatest risk of educational disadvantage. This is the single most significant investment in the DEIS programme since its inception and will benefit 347 schools across the primary and post-primary sector. It will mean that nearly 25% of Irish pupils are enrolled in a DEIS school and will bring the total number of DEIS schools in Ireland to 1,194. We know that the DEIS programme works and that it has helped to dramatically increase Ireland’s school completion rate and to narrow the attainment gap between schools. The supports provided to schools vary by school type and DEIS tier, but the supports offered under the DEIS programme can include a lower pupil-teacher ratio in DEIS urban band 1 schools, separate DEIS grant funding, access to professional support services, enhanced schoolbook grant rates and access to the home school liaison and school completion programmes. We make this investment because there is no greater leveller than education. I know that the Deputies here appreciate that. We know that being supported through school is associated with positive outcomes for a person throughout their life, be it accessing further work and study opportunities or their broader well-being, which is equally important. I know that the Covid-19 pandemic has presented considerable challenges for the education sector. I remain deeply appreciative of the leadership, dedication and courage that was shown by so many people throughout the pandemic. Between 2020 and 2022, inclusive, €860 million has been allocated for Covid-related supports and capital funding. Throughout the pandemic, this has supported an array of measures from additional staffing allocations to Covid grant payments to purchase PPE and hand sanitiser, to provide enhanced cleaning and to carry out Covid-19 related building works, such as reconfiguration works. Thankfully, while we remain vigilant in respect of the pandemic, we continue to see its effects on our children and broader society decrease. On the more general funding streams for our schools, capitation grant funding is paid to schools to meet their day-to-day current costs such as insurance, lighting and heating. This is separate to minor works funding, which is capital funding intended to support maintenance and minor upgrade work within schools. A standard rate of capitation is paid in respect of each mainstream pupil at primary and post-primary level, with enhanced rates of capitation provided for pupils enrolled in special classes and special schools and pupils from a Traveller background. At second level, additional funding is provided to support individual programmes within the school, including the transition year grant and the leaving certificate applied programme, and to schools providing Irish-medium education. That said, I understand the need for improved capitation funding. In recent years, there has been a 7.5% increase in such funding and I intend to seek further funding increases in future budgets. All schools have received the benefit of the capitation increases awarded to date. Finally, I am deeply conscious of the need to minimise the cost of school attendance for all families, parents and guardians. As a Government, we have a number of measures in place to help to do this, from the back-to-school grant, which last year supported over 200,000 children, to the school book grant, which this year provided over €17 million to schools to support book rental schemes for their pupils. Approximately 96% of primary schools and 69% of post-primary schools operate book rental schemes. Just last month, the Government announced further measures aimed at mitigating the rising cost of living, including a reduction in the maximum amount payable for families to access the school transport scheme, an increase in the threshold for the working family payment and a €200 energy credit for households. It is my strong view that the particular policy objective of this Bill will be achieved, but it will be achieved by the enactment of the charter Bill. Rather than opposing the Bill, the amendment I am seeking to move allows time for the progression of the charter Bill that will achieve the objectives set out in this Bill of improving information and transparency for parents and guardians around the collection and use of voluntary contributions by their schools, while avoiding any unintended consequences and not placing any unnecessary burden on our schools in this respect."	spk_341
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-10	dail	33	Education (Voluntary Contributions) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_48	With all due respect to the Deputy, who does not have the courtesy to wait to hear my response, in my experience, righteous indignation and rhetoric are no replacement for action and delivery. He has referred to a lack of investment in education, but the largest budget that has ever been made available to the education sector of in excess of €10 billion is a considerable investment. Last week, there was an announcement of a €32 million investment in DEIS, meaning that one in four of our students is now availing of DEIS supports in our schools. Some €17 million is being made available for the book rental scheme and there is a €20 million investment in the delivery of books, access to literature and promotion of same in our schools. In light of the challenge of Covid over the past two years, more than €860 million has been made available to schools so that they can continue operating and remain places where students can attend and work. That involves ambition and vision. In what has perhaps been the most challenging time this country and the rest of the world have ever experienced, the Department of Education, in co-operation with stakeholders, found a pathway forward for the classes of 2020, 2021 and 2022. Unique in the world in 2021, we offered both a written exam and an accredited grades process. This year, we are ensuring that seated exams are provided for. There is no absence of ambition or investment in education. Empty rhetoric and righteous indignation serve no purpose because, at the end of the day, this is all about action and delivery and I am content with the action and delivery that have been provided by my Department. The overall aim of the Bill is to ensure greater clarity for parents and guardians about voluntary contributions collected by schools but it remains my view that these objectives would be better met through the advancement of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019, which has reached an advanced stage. The approach that I am taking in the charter Bill is to put in place a set of legislative measures that will establish a framework and help support and foster a cultural change in schools in terms of engagement across the whole school community. The charter guidelines will be developed following a consultative process with the education partners. This consultative approach is of fundamental importance. It will help to ensure that the reporting requirements put in place under the charter guidelines are clear to all, ensure that the relevant information needed for transparency is made available and, importantly, are straightforward and workable at school level. The charter guidelines will set out the form and manner in which information is to be provided to students and parents, which includes publishing information about voluntary contributions and how they are spent, and, therefore, it is considered that the particular policy objective of the legislation before us will be achieved with the enactment of the charter Bill. This is an important consideration. It is my firm belief that what Deputy Ó Laoghaire's Bill sets out to achieve will be achieved in that way. The charter Bill has already been passed by the Seanad and has completed Second Stage in the Dáil. It now awaits progress to Committee Stage. Therefore, I am seeking the House's approval for my timed amendment.	spk_343
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-02	dail	33	Mental Health Services	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline the current position on the provision for children with special educational needs, including autism. Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is an ongoing priority for this Government. This year the Department of Education will invest in excess of €2 billion, or over 25% of the Department's budget, in the area of special educational needs support. As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special classes and school places are at unprecedented levels. Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to a current total of 2,148 for the 2021-22 school year. Of these, almost 1,900 special classes cater for students with autism. Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements throughout 2020 and 2021, my Department and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process that has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year. I am satisfied this approach is delivering and this intensive intervention has seen the addition of 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places that have already been opened nationwide for the 2021-22 school year. The Department recognises that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their child, particularly a child with additional needs, it can most certainly be a stressful experience. The Department is working hard to ensure there are sufficient school places appropriate to the needs of all children available on a timely basis nationwide. On Cork specifically, there is currently a network of 357 special classes, of which 309 are special classes for children with autism. Of those 309 special classes for children with autism, 228 are at primary level, including 21 early intervention classes, with 81 at post-primary level. A total of 45 new special classes have been established in Cork for the 2021-22 school year. It is important to point out that the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme provides up to two years of preschool within the eligible age range without charge. The access and inclusion model, AIM, introduced in 2016, enables the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities and additional needs in the ECCE programme. The goal is to create a more inclusive environment in preschool so all children, regardless of ability, may benefit from quality early learning and care. The model achieves this by providing universal supports to preschool settings and targeted supports focusing on the needs of the individual child. A diagnosis of autism is not required to access AIM support but preschool children with a diagnosis are generally supported in mainstream preschools, with additional supports provided through AIM where required. The NCSE sanctions the establishment of special classes, including autism spectrum disorder early intervention classes, where there is an identified need. I understand that, on occasion, early intervention classes are redesigned as school-age special classes to reflect the changing age profile of students. Kilbrittain National School currently has an enrolment of 205 students and the school, in conjunction with the NCSE, agreed that whereas an early intervention class could be opened, it would be redesignated as a primary school special class in September 2022 to meet the projected demand for places in the area. It was further noted the class would cater for the children enrolled in the early intervention class should they continue to require a special class place for primary education. On 10 February the school engaged with the NCSE on the emerging need for the retention of the early intervention class in the school and requested that the class be retained. The NCSE has now reviewed the matter and approval has been given to the school for the retention of the early intervention class for the 2022-23 school year. In addition, a new special class is being opened by the school to cater for children transitioning from this year's early intervention class. This decision was taken following consideration of the needs in the area and the capacity of the school to make the additional provision.	spk_17
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-02	dail	33	Mental Health Services	dbsect_3	I thank both Deputies and appreciate them raising this matter. It is important to put on record the commitment of this Government to special education. It is worth noting that 25% of our budget, as I outlined earlier, is dedicated to special education, which is correct. That is a budget of €2 billion. It is also important to note that considerable progress has been made in the past number of years in the provision of special education classes. We can very clearly say that budget 2022 provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022-23 school year, which will provide over 1,700 new places. This means for the 2022-23 school year, there will be a provision of 2,435 special classes, which is significant progress in a short period. I acknowledge most sincerely that further work must be done. On the provision of early intervention, I want to be very clear that the request from the school was received by the Department on 10 February; the acknowledgement from the school that its view was that there was an appropriate opportunity for the early intervention class to continue. On 1 March it was communicated that the early intervention class would continue in the school, that it would be retained, and that provision would be made for a new special class to be opened by the school to cater for children transitioning from this year's early intervention class. That speaks volumes about the proactive nature of the process, the determination and the recognition of where there is a need, early intervention classes will be put in place. Where there is a need for children to progress from the early intervention class, that will also be catered for. That is important and we must have a focus on children not just being put into classes but having a facility to progress to meet their future needs. That is being provided for.	spk_20

The NCSE has now reviewed the matter and approval has been given to the school for the retention of the early intervention class for the 2022-23 school year. In addition, a new special class is being opened by the school to cater for children transitioning from this year's early intervention class. This decision was taken following consideration of the needs in the area and the capacity of the school to make the additional provision.	spk_17
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-03-02	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_6	I thank both Deputies and appreciate them raising this matter. It is important to put on record the commitment of this Government to special education. It is worth noting that 25% of our budget, as I outlined earlier, is dedicated to special education, which is correct. That is a budget of €2 billion. It is also important to note that considerable progress has been made in the past number of years in the provision of special education classes. We can very clearly say that budget 2022 provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022-23 school year, which will provide over 1,700 new places. This means for the 2022-23 school year, there will be a provision of 2,435 special classes, which is significant progress in a short period. I acknowledge most sincerely that further work must be done. On the provision of early intervention, I want to be very clear that the request from the school was received by the Department on 10 February; the acknowledgement from the school that its view was that there was an appropriate opportunity for the early intervention class to continue. On 1 March it was communicated that the early intervention class would continue in the school, that it would be retained, and that provision would be made for a new special class to be opened by the school to cater for children transitioning from this year's early intervention class. That speaks volumes about the proactive nature of the process, the determination and the recognition of where there is a need, early intervention classes will be put in place. Where there is a need for children to progress from the early intervention class, that will also be catered for. That is important and we must have a focus on children not just being put into classes but having a facility to progress to meet their future needs. That is being provided for.	spk_20

I acknowledge that there is unanimity among the Deputies and I appreciate the passion with which they speak and the necessity for their constituents. The HSE has been seeking to acquire a site for a primary care centre at Collinstown Park Community College. This school site is in the ownership of the Minister for Education. Discussions have taken place with the HSE regarding the disposal of part of the site to the HSE for the development of the primary care centre. Discussions between the HSE and Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education Training Board, DDLETB, have been ongoing for a number of years and, more recently, with my Department. The initial proposal developed from an engagement between DDLETB, the school and the HSE was that the HSE would construct a facility adjoining the primary care centre for the use of the school. The site for this development is separated from the main school building by an internal access road. Initially, this facility was intended to be a library, but it then evolved into a multifunctional space that could be subdivided, if required. Following a review of the proposal by my Department in consultation with the HSE and ETB, it was determined that the provision of additional facilities for the school that adjoined the main school building would be more effective and provide a value-for-money solution. The Department of Education has engaged with the HSE and the ETB concerning the delivery of the facilities at their revised location adjoining the school as part of the disposal agreement. Following further engagement with the HSE and ETB, I am pleased that it has now been decided that the disposal of the site for the primary care centre will proceed separate from delivery of the facilities to the school. This is a significant positive. My Department will proceed to progress the disposal of the site to the HSE in line with the protocols for the disposal of sites between State bodies and subject to the sanction of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Department of Education is in discussions with the ETB regarding the provision of additional facilities for the school. The ETB will be submitting an application for the proposed additional facilities shortly and this application will be processed promptly upon receipt. It is anticipated that the Department will be in a position to advise the school and HSE of the outcome of this engagement with the ETB soon.	spk_416

This means that there is now the impetus for that project to move ahead. I appreciate how the timeline is an issue for the Deputies' constituents.

The Department will also obtain the necessary sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the disposal of the property. As with all property disposals, due diligence is required, which the Deputies will appreciate. This can give rise to added complexities. Therefore, it is not possible to give a definitive timeframe. However, the Department can provide the HSE with the necessary licences to enable it to commence development work on the site pending completion of the sale. That is fair progress. In tandem with that, my Department will process the application from the ETB for additional facilities for the school. I can confirm to the Deputies that officials in my Department will endeavour to progress and expedite both matters as quickly as possible. This is significant progress for both projects, which are of particular significance to the Deputies' constituents.	spk_421

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	Budget 2022 has provided for an allocation of €18 million for 2022 and €32 million for 2023 to extend the delivery of DEIS programme to further schools with the highest levels of disadvantage. This package represents an increase of more than 20% on the €150 million already allocated by my Department to provide supports for schools in the DEIS programme. The programme currently supports 884 schools. The additional funding provided in budget 2022 will allow for the extension of the programme to additional schools from September 2022. This year's package follows an extensive body of work that was undertaken by the DEIS technical group on the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. The DEIS identification process, under DEIS Plan 2017, is based on an objective, statistics-based model to determine which schools merit inclusion in the programme. An extensive body of work has been undertaken by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification. The key data sources used in the DEIS identification process are the Department of Education primary online database and post-primary online databases, and CSO data from the national census of population as represented in the Pobal HP index for small areas, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. It is important to note that schools are not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and that all schools will be considered under the refined model when it is applied. During the process to refine the DEIS identification model, as is general practice in the Department, the Department has consulted with education partners, including school management and national parent representative bodies and unions, on the technical aspects of the refinement of the DEIS identification model. The purpose of this engagement is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application. There will be further engagement with relevant stakeholders in advance of the implementation of the refined DEIS identification model. The programme for Government sets out a commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model, ensuring the extension of DEIS status to schools that are identified as being suitable.	spk_304
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	We intend to be in a position to roll out the DEIS model for 2022. We have an ambition programme of funding being made available for it. It was a considerable achievement that, for budget 2022, there was €18 million available, rising to €32 million in 2023, with the explicit intention of enhancing or extending the DEIS model in our schools. A greater number of schools will be included in the DEIS scheme. Extensive work has been undertaken. There has been engagement with stakeholders, as I have outlined to the Deputy. At every stage I welcome the thoughts of Opposition Deputies. The Deputy is welcome to make those thoughts known to me. Regarding this specific engagement, I believe that my Department has communicated to him that, as we come towards the finalisation of the programme, we will consult with all of the stakeholders once again, including Opposition spokespersons.	spk_306

In advance of completion and implementation of the DEIS identification model there will be further engagement with relevant stakeholders.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	"I thank Deputy Murphy for his question. I watched much of the discussion this evening on ""Six One"". In the main, students asked for clarity regarding leaving certificate 2022 and they acknowledged they have received that. In fact, the students asked for four things when I met them. The second thing they asked was that there would be additional changes made to the exam papers and we have provided for that. They also raised the issue of grade inflation in terms of the class of 2022 competing with the class of 2021 and we have addressed that issue for them. They also raised the issue of accredited grades, but as I have already explained, we are not in a position to offer accredited grades this year because one in four students does not have data related to the junior cycle. Those data are important because they are used for comparability or standardisation for students. It is fair to say that the reaction of students today has been varied. The views of parents and others around the table are also varied. I have met with all of those around the table, including parents, students, teaching unions and management bodies, have listened to them and heard what they had to say. Specifically on the four points that were raised by the students, I have gone as far as I possibly can to ensure they are presented with what they have asked me to do for them. I am in a position to deliver on three of their requests but the fourth one, for reasons I have outlined, cannot be delivered because of an absence of data. We are not in a position to provide for accredited grades this year in a similar fashion to last year. If Deputy Murphy heard the news this evening, he would recognise that many of the students accepted that the absence of data is an issue."	spk_310
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	To the Deputy's suggestion that we are just ploughing on I would say, far from it. He should take time to study what has been put in place in terms of these exams in June. It is very clear the exams in June are very different from what has been offered previously. For example, students studying maths would traditionally have had ten questions to answer but there is such significant choice now that they only have to answer six on paper one and paper two. On the higher level English paper two there are three very significant bodies of study. Rather than answering three questions, students will only answer two. Those changes are across all sections, including the oral exams. In the Spanish oral exam, for example, students would have had to prepare for five role plays but this year they will only have to prepare for three. Likewise, with Irish where they would have had 20 sraith pictiúr, they now have ten. These significant changes are across the system and are an acknowledgement of what the students actually asked for. They asked that additional changes would be made to the papers and that has been achieved. They also raised the question of grade inflation and a commitment has been given that the grade inflation for 2022 will be on a par with 2021. In terms of the accredited grades, I have not heard Deputy Murphy propose any alternative. We have said there is an absence of data so it cannot be as fair as the system we were in a position to operate last year.	spk_312
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	I have to be very clear that the question of access to higher education is a policy matter which is not under my remit but under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. I am aware it is a key of objective of that Department to ensure there is access into either further or higher education for each person who wishes to pursue educational options at third level. Regarding the leaving certificate, what is being offered this year is different. Again, I have not heard Deputy Murphy reference how he would propose to offer accredited grades given-----	spk_314

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	-----very clearly that we have not answered the needs of students, but I am saying we specifically went through each of the four issues that were raised by students. They asked for clarity, greater choice and that we would address the issues of grade inflation and accredited grades. We were able to address three out of four of those issues for them, but because of an absence of data, we were not able to address the fourth one. We have made sufficient and significant changes to the papers to accommodate the students going forward.	spk_318
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	In recent weeks, I have attended a meeting with the advisory group on State examinations, which has representatives of students, parents, teachers, managerial bodies, the further and higher education sector, and the State Examinations Commission, SEC. Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter. I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points. Following consideration of this matter by the Government today, I announced the decision to operate an examinations approach for the leaving certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of the leaving certificate in 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run accredited grades in the same manner as last year, as junior cycle data was unavailable for one in four students. The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, means that candidates have greater choice in the papers; have fewer questions to answer and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, in both mathematics papers, instead of having to answer all ten questions, candidates will only have to answer six. This is in addition to previously announced changes such as the running of the oral examinations and music practical over the first week of the Easter break.  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the leaving certificate applied examinations have also been pushed out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination coursework. I have also confirmed that junior cycle examinations will take place this summer. Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for junior cycle were published in August 2021 and provide for more teaching time in schools. They include a reduction in the number of classroom-based assessments to be completed, the removal of the requirement to complete assessment tasks and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests. I believe the decision that has been made will provide leaving certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education to be assessed and will enable them to progress to the next stage of their lives. It also provides the certainty and clarity in this matter that had been requested.	spk_320
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	As I outlined, I have engaged with all the stakeholders, including parents, students, teachers and school management bodies. I have listened to the proposals they put on the table and evaluated each one of them. They were primarily around making additional changes to the written papers - the exams as we know them - and I answered that. Substantial additional changes have been made to the papers. I was also asked to consider grade inflation. I am amazed that the only people the Deputy heard speaking about grade inflation were from the Opposition. In fact, grade inflation was raised by many people around the table, including students. I have addressed the issue of grade inflation. The matter of accredited grades was also raised. We did look at it. It is important that there be comparability or standardisation as part of the accredited grades process. It is important that the data available are the data belonging to the students, as was the case last year, because that is the fairest. Because of the absence of data, we were not in a position for accredited grades to be as fair as they were last year to the class of 2021.	spk_322
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	What has been set out today is that there will be additional choice which means there is greater time and less content required to be studied to take these exams in June. We are not just talking about the written exams but also the orals and practical exams. There have been accommodations along the line there. That was a chief consideration for the students and one they raised consistently around the table. They felt that the class of 2022 could not compete with the class of 2021 because of grade inflation. A concession was rightly made to acknowledge that grade inflation for the class of 2022 would be on a par with that of 2021. On accredited grades, at the heart of it, the students wanted it to be fair. To afford students accredited grades would not be as fair as I would like when we do not have the data that are necessary for standardisation or comparability.	spk_324
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a project for the schools to which he refers has recently been approved. The single project will provide for the construction of a 41-classroom primary school for Trinity National School as well as the development of an eight-classroom primary school for Tuam Educate Together National School on the same site. Special education needs classes are also being provided for both schools. I can also confirm that the project for Trinity National School will facilitate the amalgamation to which he refers. Trinity National School is an amalgamation of three schools; namely, Presentation Primary School, Scoil Mhuire Mercy Primary School and St. Patrick’s Primary School. The amalgamation took place from 1 September 2019 and the three schools' existing buildings are continuing to be used until the new amalgamated school is provided. The Department will be devolving the delivery of this project to Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, ETB. The next step in the progression of this project through the architectural planning process is for Galway and Roscommon ETB to enter into a service level agreement with the Department. The execution of the service level agreement is currently under way. Once this is in place, Galway and Roscommon ETB will proceed with the appointment of a design team to progress the project through design, planning and construction in due course. I thank Galway and Roscommon ETB for taking on the management and delivery of this campus project. This project will involve a very significant investment in the provision of new and very modern school facilities in Tuam and is very welcome.	spk_326
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy. I agree with him this is a very significant and positive development and an ambitious project for the town and rightly so. The single project will provide, as I have said, for the construction of a 41-classroom primary school for Trinity national school as well as the development of an eight-classroom primary school for Tuam Educate Together national school together on the same site. The timeline for the completion of the campus projects progressed together as a single project should not be expected to be any different from an equivalent single major building project that is not on a campus. However, at least until such time as the statutory consent process has been completed it is not possible at this stage to provide a timeline for the completion of the project, but it is my expectation that the service level agreement will be progressed as a matter of priority.	spk_328

In all sectors of society and most notably in the education sector, we can achieve great things when we enter into the spirit of collaboration and co-operation. This is an excellent example of patrons coming together, of there being a very clear and defined ambition for education in Tuam and because of the collective engagement and the generosity of everyone involved in the process, ensuring that we can develop what will really be an ambitious, positive and significant development in education for Tuam. It is a development that looks to the future with ambition for education in the area. I support the Deputy's very positive comments.	spk_330
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy for raising the question. The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the current school year more than 121,400 children, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over €289 million in 2021. The Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. Following commencement of this review the steering group presented me with an interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school. Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures in the current school year for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second-nearest school rather than their nearest school. Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently under way. As part of this phase of the review, the Department is currently conducting an extensive stakeholder engagement process. The Department will be listening to the views specifically of parents and guardians, students, the education partners and other relevant stakeholders through the use of surveys, focus groups and meetings, as well as inviting written submissions. The Department is inviting stakeholders to share their views and opinions so that they may be considered as part of the assessment and in informing policy on the future operation of the scheme. The steering group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. This is an important body of work but it is also important that I receive those interim reports because it allows me to progress, as I did previously for this school year, on actions that can be taken. The work continues with the widest possible level of engagement.	spk_333
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy for the points he raised. On some of them, for example the 70 years of age rule, that is something that is across the public sector and not unique to this operation here. In many of the issues he raises, this requires a wide and all-encompassing review of the system to ensure it is serving the students and their families. This year we introduced the eligibility for students who were not necessarily attending their nearest school but their second-nearest school. We have done that because there is an acknowledgement that there is a difficulty for students for a variety of reasons, in terms of accessing their second-nearest school. There is a broader context here as well. We are looking at efficiencies in terms of travel, in terms of utilising the transport service and making it as readily available as possible so that it is freeing up families in terms of the commitment of taking children to school.	spk_338
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_18	I appreciate the points raised by the Deputy because I appreciate the importance of the school transport system, especially in rural constituencies such as ours. I was, therefore, very clear that there needed to be a review of the system as it currently stands. I ensured that the review began, which it did in a timely fashion, and that interim recommendations were made to me. I have actioned those recommendations. The Deputy has raised different points, but it is important that everybody gets the opportunity to flag particular issues. We are currently engaging with parents, students, all stakeholders and anybody who wants to make a submission. Those submissions are being evaluated, as are all the points being raised, to ensure that the school transport system as we know it meets the needs and demands of students and their families.

The purpose of this engagement is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application. There will be further engagement with relevant stakeholders in advance of the implementation of the refined DEIS identification model. The programme for Government sets out a commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model, ensuring the extension of DEIS status to schools that are identified as being suitable.	spk_304
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	Education Schemes	dbsect_19	We intend to be in a position to roll out the DEIS model for 2022. We have an ambition programme of funding being made available for it. It was a considerable achievement that, for budget 2022, there was €18 million available, rising to €32 million in 2023, with the explicit intention of enhancing or extending the DEIS model in our schools. A greater number of schools will be included in the DEIS scheme. Extensive work has been undertaken. There has been engagement with stakeholders, as I have outlined to the Deputy. At every stage I welcome the thoughts of Opposition Deputies. The Deputy is welcome to make those thoughts known to me. Regarding this specific engagement, I believe that my Department has communicated to him that, as we come towards the finalisation of the programme, we will consult with all of the stakeholders once again, including Opposition spokespersons.	spk_306
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	Education Schemes	dbsect_19	Again, to confirm to the Deputy, the process of refining the DEIS identification model has been a consequence of and is reliant on the engagement of a variety of stakeholders, as I have already outlined, including school management, national parent representative bodies, unions and so on, particularly with regard to the technical aspects of the refinement. In advance of completion and implementation of the DEIS identification model there will be further engagement with relevant stakeholders. As I have outlined to Deputy Ó Laoghaire, there will be an opportunity, as we near the end of the process, to engage with Opposition spokespersons also.	spk_308
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	Educational Reform	dbsect_20	"I thank Deputy Murphy for his question. I watched much of the discussion this evening on ""Six One"". In the main, students asked for clarity regarding leaving certificate 2022 and they acknowledged they have received that. In fact, the students asked for four things when I met them. The second thing they asked was that there would be additional changes made to the exam papers and we have provided for that. They also raised the issue of grade inflation in terms of the class of 2022 competing with the class of 2021 and we have addressed that issue for them. They also raised the issue of accredited grades, but as I have already explained, we are not in a position to offer accredited grades this year because one in four students does not have data related to the junior cycle. Those data are important because they are used for comparability or standardisation for students. It is fair to say that the reaction of students today has been varied. The views of parents and others around the table are also varied. I have met with all of those around the table, including parents, students, teaching unions and management bodies, have listened to them and heard what they had to say. Specifically on the four points that were raised by the students, I have gone as far as I possibly can to ensure they are presented with what they have asked me to do for them. I am in a position to deliver on three of their requests but the fourth one, for reasons I have outlined, cannot be delivered because of an absence of data. We are not in a position to provide for accredited grades this year in a similar fashion to last year. If Deputy Murphy heard the news this evening, he would recognise that many of the students accepted that the absence of data is an issue."	spk_310
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	Educational Reform	dbsect_20	To the Deputy's suggestion that we are just ploughing on I would say, far from it. He should take time to study what has been put in place in terms of these exams in June. It is very clear the exams in June are very different from what has been offered previously. For example, students studying maths would traditionally have had ten questions to answer but there is such significant choice now that they only have to answer six on paper one and paper two. On the higher level English paper two there are three very significant bodies of study. Rather than answering three questions, students will only answer two. Those changes are across all sections, including the oral exams. In the Spanish oral exam, for example, students would have had to prepare for five role plays but this year they will only have to prepare for three. Likewise, with Irish where they would have had 20 sraith pictiúr, they now have ten. These significant changes are across the system and are an acknowledgement of what the students actually asked for. They asked that additional changes would be made to the papers and that has been achieved. They also raised the question of grade inflation and a commitment has been given that the grade inflation for 2022 will be on a par with 2021. In terms of the accredited grades, I have not heard Deputy Murphy propose any alternative. We have said there is an absence of data so it cannot be as fair as the system we were in a position to operate last year.	spk_312
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	Educational Reform	dbsect_20	I have to be very clear that the question of access to higher education is a policy matter which is not under my remit but under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. I am aware it is a key of objective of that Department to ensure there is access into either further or higher education for each person who wishes to pursue educational options at third level. Regarding the leaving certificate, what is being offered this year is different. Again, I have not heard Deputy Murphy reference how he would propose to offer accredited grades given-----	spk_314
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	Educational Reform	dbsect_20	I am just making the point the Deputy said-----	spk_316
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	Educational Reform	dbsect_20	-----very clearly that we have not answered the needs of students, but I am saying we specifically went through each of the four issues that were raised by students. They asked for clarity, greater choice and that we would address the issues of grade inflation and accredited grades. We were able to address three out of four of those issues for them, but because of an absence of data, we were not able to address the fourth one. We have made sufficient and significant changes to the papers to accommodate the students going forward.	spk_318
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_21	In recent weeks, I have attended a meeting with the advisory group on State examinations, which has representatives of students, parents, teachers, managerial bodies, the further and higher education sector, and the State Examinations Commission, SEC. Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter. I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points. Following consideration of this matter by the Government today, I announced the decision to operate an examinations approach for the leaving certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of the leaving certificate in 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run accredited grades in the same manner as last year, as junior cycle data was unavailable for one in four students. The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, means that candidates have greater choice in the papers; have fewer questions to answer and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, in both mathematics papers, instead of having to answer all ten questions, candidates will only have to answer six. This is in addition to previously announced changes such as the running of the oral examinations and music practical over the first week of the Easter break.  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the leaving certificate applied examinations have also been pushed out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination coursework. I have also confirmed that junior cycle examinations will take place this summer. Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for junior cycle were published in August 2021 and provide for more teaching time in schools. They include a reduction in the number of classroom-based assessments to be completed, the removal of the requirement to complete assessment tasks and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests. I believe the decision that has been made will provide leaving certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education to be assessed and will enable them to progress to the next stage of their lives. It also provides the certainty and clarity in this matter that had been requested.	spk_320
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_21	As I outlined, I have engaged with all the stakeholders, including parents, students, teachers and school management bodies. I have listened to the proposals they put on the table and evaluated each one of them. They were primarily around making additional changes to the written papers - the exams as we know them - and I answered that. Substantial additional changes have been made to the papers. I was also asked to consider grade inflation. I am amazed that the only people the Deputy heard speaking about grade inflation were from the Opposition. In fact, grade inflation was raised by many people around the table, including students. I have addressed the issue of grade inflation. The matter of accredited grades was also raised. We did look at it. It is important that there be comparability or standardisation as part of the accredited grades process. It is important that the data available are the data belonging to the students, as was the case last year, because that is the fairest. Because of the absence of data, we were not in a position for accredited grades to be as fair as they were last year to the class of 2021.	spk_322
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_21	What has been set out today is that there will be additional choice which means there is greater time and less content required to be studied to take these exams in June. We are not just talking about the written exams but also the orals and practical exams. There have been accommodations along the line there. That was a chief consideration for the students and one they raised consistently around the table. They felt that the class of 2022 could not compete with the class of 2021 because of grade inflation. A concession was rightly made to acknowledge that grade inflation for the class of 2022 would be on a par with that of 2021. On accredited grades, at the heart of it, the students wanted it to be fair. To afford students accredited grades would not be as fair as I would like when we do not have the data that are necessary for standardisation or comparability.	spk_324
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_22	I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a project for the schools to which he refers has recently been approved. The single project will provide for the construction of a 41-classroom primary school for Trinity National School as well as the development of an eight-classroom primary school for Tuam Educate Together National School on the same site. Special education needs classes are also being provided for both schools. I can also confirm that the project for Trinity National School will facilitate the amalgamation to which he refers. Trinity National School is an amalgamation of three schools; namely, Presentation Primary School, Scoil Mhuire Mercy Primary School and St. Patrick’s Primary School. The amalgamation took place from 1 September 2019 and the three schools' existing buildings are continuing to be used until the new amalgamated school is provided. The Department will be devolving the delivery of this project to Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, ETB. The next step in the progression of this project through the architectural planning process is for Galway and Roscommon ETB to enter into a service level agreement with the Department. The execution of the service level agreement is currently under way. Once this is in place, Galway and Roscommon ETB will proceed with the appointment of a design team to progress the project through design, planning and construction in due course. I thank Galway and Roscommon ETB for taking on the management and delivery of this campus project. This project will involve a very significant investment in the provision of new and very modern school facilities in Tuam and is very welcome.	spk_326
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_22	I thank the Deputy. I agree with him this is a very significant and positive development and an ambitious project for the town and rightly so. The single project will provide, as I have said, for the construction of a 41-classroom primary school for Trinity national school as well as the development of an eight-classroom primary school for Tuam Educate Together national school together on the same site. The timeline for the completion of the campus projects progressed together as a single project should not be expected to be any different from an equivalent single major building project that is not on a campus. However, at least until such time as the statutory consent process has been completed it is not possible at this stage to provide a timeline for the completion of the project, but it is my expectation that the service level agreement will be progressed as a matter of priority.	spk_328
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_22	I thank the Deputy. I acknowledge the commendation of the patrons. There has been a very strong collaborative and co-operative approach taken here and that is very important. In all sectors of society and most notably in the education sector, we can achieve great things when we enter into the spirit of collaboration and co-operation. This is an excellent example of patrons coming together, of there being a very clear and defined ambition for education in Tuam and because of the collective engagement and the generosity of everyone involved in the process, ensuring that we can develop what will really be an ambitious, positive and significant development in education for Tuam. It is a development that looks to the future with ambition for education in the area. I support the Deputy's very positive comments.	spk_330
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_23	I thank the Deputy for raising the question. The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the current school year more than 121,400 children, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over €289 million in 2021. The Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. Following commencement of this review the steering group presented me with an interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school. Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures in the current school year for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second-nearest school rather than their nearest school. Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently under way. As part of this phase of the review, the Department is currently conducting an extensive stakeholder engagement process. The Department will be listening to the views specifically of parents and guardians, students, the education partners and other relevant stakeholders through the use of surveys, focus groups and meetings, as well as inviting written submissions. The Department is inviting stakeholders to share their views and opinions so that they may be considered as part of the assessment and in informing policy on the future operation of the scheme. The steering group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. This is an important body of work but it is also important that I receive those interim reports because it allows me to progress, as I did previously for this school year, on actions that can be taken. The work continues with the widest possible level of engagement.	spk_333
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_23	I thank the Deputy for the points he raised. On some of them, for example the 70 years of age rule, that is something that is across the public sector and not unique to this operation here. In many of the issues he raises, this requires a wide and all-encompassing review of the system to ensure it is serving the students and their families. This year we introduced the eligibility for students who were not necessarily attending their nearest school but their second-nearest school. We have done that because there is an acknowledgement that there is a difficulty for students for a variety of reasons, in terms of accessing their second-nearest school. There is a broader context here as well. We are looking at efficiencies in terms of travel, in terms of utilising the transport service and making it as readily available as possible so that it is freeing up families in terms of the commitment of taking children to school.	spk_338
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_23	I appreciate the points raised by the Deputy because I appreciate the importance of the school transport system, especially in rural constituencies such as ours. I was, therefore, very clear that there needed to be a review of the system as it currently stands. I ensured that the review began, which it did in a timely fashion, and that interim recommendations were made to me. I have actioned those recommendations. The Deputy has raised different points, but it is important that everybody gets the opportunity to flag particular issues. We are currently engaging with parents, students, all stakeholders and anybody who wants to make a submission. Those submissions are being evaluated, as are all the points being raised, to ensure that the school transport system as we know it meets the needs and demands of students and their families. All issues will be addressed.	spk_340
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_23	Yes, there is an openness for submissions.	spk_342
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I am very aware of the disruption experienced by students who are due to take their junior cycle examinations this year. The State Examinations Commission, SEC, with my Department, has been progressing planning for these examinations in consultation with, as I have previously outlined, the advisory group on planning for the State examinations, which has met on a number of occasions to consider this matter. As I previously said, I also met with this group on a bilateral basis over recent weeks. Following consideration of this matter by the Government, today I announced decisions regarding this year’s leaving certificate and junior cycle examinations. I was happy to confirm that the junior cycle examinations will take place this summer for the first time since 2019 having been cancelled in 2020 and 2021 on foot of public health advice due to the impact of Covid-19. I was strongly of the view that these examinations should proceed this year. This year is the first year that all of the new subject specifications for junior cycle will be assessed by the SEC. A number of adjustments to the assessment arrangements for junior cycle have been published to take account of the impact of Covid and will provide for more teaching time in schools. As part of the junior cycle, students normally complete a number of classroom-based assessments, CBAs, which have been reduced by 50%. The school also has autonomy in dealing with the CBAs regarding when they will be completed by students, with some exceptions. As CBAs are school-based assessments, schools have been advised that there are flexibilities in the windows for completion of the CBAs in light of particular circumstances within an individual school. The assessment task, which is usually assessed and marked by the SEC, will not be assessed in 2022 in the relevant subjects. Instead, the written examination will account for 100% of the marks, giving further time within the schools. Adjustments have been made to the requirements for practicals and coursework in subjects including, for example, music, home economics, art and technologies. No changes have been made to the other aspects of the examinations as these are already specific and very significant changes to their format. It is a recognition of the importance of running the exam for the first time in three years.	spk_344
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I will be clear that 2022 is the first year that all the new subject specifications for junior cycle will be assessed by the SEC. Those specifications provide for a very flexible and wide-realm approach in respect of questions and options being made available to students. A number of significant adjustments have been made. I know from my own experience that the requirement that a number of CBAs take place for a subject is quite a time constraint within the classroom. Those have, therefore, been cut by 50%. The assessment task, another task that is time demanding within the classroom and the experience of what can be provided from a teaching and learning point of view, has been done away with this year. These are very significant and progressive steps forward. Other amendments have been made. For example, adjustments have been made to the requirements for practicals and coursework in particular subjects, such as music, home economics, art and technologies. It is important to recognise that there have been adjustments and changes to provide greater flexibility for junior cycle students.	spk_346
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	It is important to reiterate that there have been changes, amendments and alterations to the paper. The papers have been tailored to meet the needs of the class of 2022. I will again specifically reference, as somebody who has worked in the area, that it is a considerable benefit that the number of CBAs has been reduced by 50%. To address the time issue raised by the Deputy, I know it is also a considerable benefit that the assessment task no longer takes place. The adjustments that have been made to practicals, including those for music, home economics, art and technologies, are of significant benefit. It is also important to acknowledge that the junior cycle examination papers are completed in a booklet format, with students required to answer all questions. The papers are designed to assess the subject specifications in an integrated way, reflecting the way in which teachers’ expertise is used to plan for delivering the subjects using integrated strands and elements. Any adjustments made to these papers at this stage would make them fundamentally different from expectations and what students are expecting. They would be more likely to disadvantage rather than benefit students, while acknowledging yet again that there have been significant alterations to, and tailoring of, the papers to meet the needs of the class of 2022.	spk_348
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	As already outlined to the House, in recent weeks I attended a meeting with the advisory group on State examinations, which is representative of students, parents, teachers, managerial bodies, the further and higher education sector and the State Examinations Commission. Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a one-to one or bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter. I listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders had to say and examined each of their points. Following consideration of this matter by the Government today, I announced the decision to operate an examinations approach for the leaving certificate class of 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of leaving certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run accredited grades in the same manner as had been done last year as junior cycle data was unavailable for 25%, or one in four, of our students.  The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers over and above those announced in August 2021 mean that candidates have greater choice in the papers, have less questions to answer and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, as I have previously outlined, in mathematics, where students would traditionally have ten questions to answer, they now have only six. This is in addition to previously announced changes such as the running of the oral examinations and music practical over the first week of the Easter break.  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the leaving certificate applied examinations have also been pushed out.

As I outlined earlier, they include a reduction in the number of classroom-based assessments, the removal of the requirement to complete the assessment tasks and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I reiterate that we are all very conscious of the difficulties of the past two years for the education sector and for wider society, but most specifically in this instance for our students. As I have previously outlined to the House, I have engaged with students, parents, teachers and school management bodies. There were four key points consistently raised by students, including the necessity to have clarity, which we have provided today. We were in a position to do that earlier this year than was achieved last year. The second point was that they would have greater choice in the examination papers. As I have outlined to the Deputy, we have achieved that for them. There is a significantly different examination being experienced by students in 2022 than was experienced by those in 2018 or 2019. The issue of grade inflation was a key point highlighted by students. Again, I have given the commitment today that the grade inflation of 2021 will be on a par for the class of 2022. On the accredited grades process and the issues around that, we did do work on that. There is an issue around the fact that one in four students do not have the junior cycle data.	spk_352
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I thank the Deputies. On Deputy Murnane O'Connor's specific question with regard to the accommodation for students who have a significant illness, a bereavement or are impacted by Covid, it may have escaped the Deputy but I did announce some time ago that there is a contingency second sitting of the examination, which will take place immediately after the first sitting of the examination. This is for exceptional cases such as a medical issue pertaining to a student, a bereavement or an issue pertaining to Covid. I appreciate the points that have been raised in regard to the need to support the students in all aspects of their lives. Deputies will be aware that earlier this year we launched the Covid learning and support scheme for schools, which is not only a support scheme with additional hours and additional teaching resources for academic learning, but also for well-being initiatives within our schools. On the issue of senior cycle reform, I am enormously committed to senior cycle reform. It is something that we will be progressing. My objective is to ensure that we maximise the potential of all of our students and the assessment of their various skill sets, and provide pathways for them.	spk_355
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, there has been significant growth in post-primary student numbers in the Swords area in recent years. Across the Swords school planning area, total post-primary enrolments have increased by over 800 pupils since 2011. Enrolments at Fingal Community College have grown by over 300 in that same timeframe and additional accommodation was provided at the school in 2015 and 2016 in order to address the increased pupil numbers. In the context of further increasing pupil numbers at Fingal Community College the school submitted an application for capital funding under my Department's additional school accommodation scheme. An interim solution to meet the needs of the school was put in place. However, as part of the assessment process for an additional school accommodation application my officials consider not just the existing enrolments at the school, but also anticipated future needs in order to make full and appropriate provision for both current and future students. To anticipate school place requirements, my Department uses a geographical information system, utilising statistical models, child benefit data, school enrolment figures, information on residential development activity, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets and other relevant data. The most recent projections of post-primary school place requirements in the Swords school planning area show continued growth in requirements over the coming years.  Having considered the existing accommodation at the school relative to both current and long-term needs in the area, it was determined that there should be significant additional permanent accommodation provision at Fingal Community College. However, the school site is extremely constrained and this presents significant challenges in delivering the required volume of accommodation. In that context, my Department is working to formulate an appropriate long-term plan to meet the needs of the school and deliver the required accommodation in consultation with the school's patron, Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board, ETB.A number of potential options are being explored in this regard and the Deputy will appreciate that to identify the optimum solution for this school, it is necessary to undertake a full and thorough technical appraisal of these options, which takes some time. Pending the delivery of this long-term solution, the Department will continue to work with Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB as school patron to ensure any necessary interim accommodation requirements are met.	spk_357
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I appreciate the case that the Deputy makes. I recognise the necessity for the area. The key issue is that the school site is extremely constrained, as the Deputy identified. That is presenting considerable challenges in delivering the required volume of accommodation necessary for the school. It is a tribute to the school that it is growing. The Department is heavily committed to working to formulate an appropriate long-term solution to meet the accommodation needs of the school. We are doing that. I acknowledge the co-operation of the school's patron, Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB. A number of different, appropriate options are being explored. The Deputy will appreciate that, for every option, there needs to be a considered evaluation and that is a time constraint. I assure the Deputy that priority is being given to this matter.	spk_359
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I thank the Deputies. I appreciate their points and the acknowledgement there is an absolute commitment on the part of the Department to the advancement of the school Deputy Farrell mentioned. On the point raised by Deputy Crowe, I can confirm the school to which he referred has been approved for a project under the Department's additional accommodation scheme. The project will provide for one mainstream classroom and a two-classroom special educational needs base. I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that the Department approved this project to proceed to construction in May of 2021. The project is currently on site. The school has recently submitted a request for additional funding for the project to provide a sensory garden, hard play and soft play areas and six car parking spaces. I am pleased to inform the Deputy of our agreement in principle to provide the additional funding in question, subject to agreement being reached on the costs associated with the proposal.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I appreciate the case the Deputy has made. There are similar cases throughout the country. As I said earlier, budget 2022 has provided for an allocation of €18 million for 2022 and €32 million for 2023 to extend the DEIS programme to further schools with the highest levels of disadvantage. As the Deputy has acknowledged, this package represents an increase of over 20% on the €150 million already allocated by my Department to provide supports for schools in the DEIS programme. The DEIS programme currently supports 884 schools. The additional funding provided in budget 2022 will allow for the extension of the programme to additional schools from September 2022. This year's package follows an extensive body of work which has been undertaken by the DEIS technical group on the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. The DEIS identification process under the DEIS plan is based on an objective, statistics-based model to determine which schools merit inclusion in the programme. An extensive body of work has been undertaken by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification. The key data sources are the Department of Education primary online database, the post-primary online databases and Central Statistics Office data from the national census of population as represented in the Pobal HP index for small areas, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. It is important to note that schools are not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and that all schools will be considered under the refined model when it is applied. During the process to refine the DEIS identification model, and as is general practice in the Department, my Department has consulted school management, national parent representative bodies and unions on the technical aspects of the refinement of the DEIS identification model. The purpose of this engagement is to ensure, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application. There will be further engagement with relevant stakeholders in advance of the implementation of the refined DEIS identification model.	spk_369

I want to be clear that the progression, enhancement and expansion of the DEIS model to as many schools as possible has been a chief objective of my Ministry. It is a significant undertaking by the Department of Education to have secured €18 million for 2022 and €32 million for 2023 to advance that objective clearly for the types of schools the Deputy has referenced. Such schools are spread throughout the country. I am conscious of that and I know that. I have clearly said to the Deputy it is my intention that the new DEIS programme, including the schools that will be added to DEIS status, will be operational from September 2022. I am currently working towards that target. I am confident we will reach that target and it will be operational for September 2022.	spk_371

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	In recent weeks, I attended a meeting with the advisory group on State examinations, which has representatives of students, parents, teachers, managerial bodies, the further and higher education sector and the State Examinations Commission. As I previously outlined, following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a one-to-one and bilateral basis and had further engagement with each of them thereafter. I listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders had to say and examined each of their points. Following consideration of this matter by Government today, I announced the decision to operate an examinations approach for leaving certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations, and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of leaving certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run accredited grades in the same manner as last year because junior cycle data were unavailable for one in four of our students. The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, mean that candidates have greater choice in the papers, fewer questions to answer and still have the same time as in a normal year to complete the examination. Various examples can be given. For the Spanish oral, rather than having five presentations to prepare for in terms of role play, they will only have three. In the sraith pictiúr in Irish, where they would normally have 20 to prepare for, they now have ten. This is, of course, a significant change to the examinations as students would have known them and an accommodation of issues that have been raised by them. Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the leaving certificate applied examinations have been also pushed out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination course work. Importantly, I also confirmed that junior cycle examinations will take place this summer. Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for junior cycle were published in August 2021 and provide for more teaching time in schools. They include a reduction in the number of CBAs to be completed, the removal of the requirement to complete assessment tasks and adjustments to the requirements in course work and practical performance tests. I believe the decision will provide the junior cycle and leaving certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end.	spk_382
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I must point out to the Deputy that if an answer given the first time is honest, fair and accurate, it will be the same answer I give him the second and, indeed, third and fourth time. If it is a truthful answer first time, it will remain a truthful answer. I have given a truthful answer in this House as regards my engagements, the deliberations concerning leaving certificate 2022 and the junior cycle, engagements I had with the advisory group, parents, students and teachers, the issues that were raised with me by students, in particular, where they asked for clarity and for greater choice in their examinations, which we delivered upon today. I outlined for the Deputy earlier what they were. Issues of grade inflation were raised by many around the table at the advisory group, which I delivered upon today. Issues regarding accredited grades were raised. I very clearly pointed out to this House in an honest answer the difficulty in that we could not implement accredited grades this year in a similar and fair fashion to how that was implemented last year. For that reason, I maintain the answers I gave the first, second and, indeed, third time	spk_384
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I want to be clear that the reason the hybrid model or accredited grades aspect is not being implemented this year is that when a teacher provides an estimated mark, he or she does so because he or she knows his or her student.He or she does not know the student in another class whom the teacher has not taught. It is important that there is comparability between the students in a national examination. To achieve that comparability, as I have outlined earlier, we relied upon the junior cycle data belonging to the class of that year group. One in four of the class of 2022 does not have those data. Therefore, we were not in a position to provide the accredited grades in as fair a manner as was provided to the students last year. That is the honest reason as to what has transpired.  I want to be clear that I am committed to senior cycle reform. I am conscious that we need to find a mechanism that can assess the various talents, abilities and skill sets of our students in the widest possible manner. That needs to be incorporated into senior cycle, as indeed does the maximum potential for students going forward to choose whatever pathway they might wish to choose. I am completely committed to it. 	spk_387

As the Deputy is aware, the public consultation aspect of his process recently concluded. It deals with the new draft specifications for leaving certificate Irish. The current development of draft specifications for leaving certificate Irish is part of the ongoing cycle of curriculum review and redevelopment. As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, opened the consultation process. In response to stakeholder concerns and requests, it extended the closing date at the end of November 2021. To support stakeholder participation, the NCCA employed a wide range of consultation tools, including an online survey, bilateral and focus group meetings and written submissions. The NCCA is conducting a detailed analysis of all feedback that is received. It is hoped that an interim consultation report will be presented to the NCCA council in June. A report on early enactment of Irish at junior cycle is also due to be presented to the NCCA council shortly. I look forward to the outcomes of these processes in due course. 	spk_389
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I thank the Deputy. I know that he has a particular and passionate interest in this. He have raised it on an ongoing basis with me. With all due respect, it has been raised by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and indeed by others here. I wish to acknowledge that there has been considerable engagement via the consultation process. For example, the NCCA has received some 740 responses in the online survey, as well as 240 written submissions. In addition, the NCCA hosted 13 focus group meetings in which there were 275 participants. Some eight bilateral meetings were held, and 19 individual interviews were held with teachers. Therefore, there has been significant engagement. That engagement is important because it will inform the ultimate decision that is made. To respect that process, it is important that I allow the analysis of that feedback, as well as the varied views, I have no doubt, that have been offered. We should allow that to be completed.	spk_391
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_24	I need to say that it is important in every sector, including in the education sector, that the widest realm of people who are involved in the process have an opportunity to put and to record their views and their thoughts. I accept the passionately and sincerely held views that have been articulated by both Deputies here. However, it is important, in the interest of fairness and the interests of the process, that all views and all shades of views would be facilitated in having their voices heard. That is exactly what this consultation process has been about, namely, facilitating similarities of views as well as dissimilarity of views. I have no doubt that there will be competing views expressed here via this process. I accept that the publication of the conclusion of this process needs to be done as a matter of priority. It will be done. However, it is important that the considered views of everybody who engaged - and the Deputies will can see that it has been a huge engagement by people - would be given due consideration.	spk_394
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_25	I am very aware of the disruption experienced by students who are due to take their junior cycle examinations this year. The State Examinations Commission, SEC, with my Department, has been progressing planning for these examinations in consultation with, as I have previously outlined, the advisory group on planning for the State examinations, which has met on a number of occasions to consider this matter. As I previously said, I also met with this group on a bilateral basis over recent weeks. Following consideration of this matter by the Government, today I announced decisions regarding this year’s leaving certificate and junior cycle examinations. I was happy to confirm that the junior cycle examinations will take place this summer for the first time since 2019 having been cancelled in 2020 and 2021 on foot of public health advice due to the impact of Covid-19. I was strongly of the view that these examinations should proceed this year. This year is the first year that all of the new subject specifications for junior cycle will be assessed by the SEC. A number of adjustments to the assessment arrangements for junior cycle have been published to take account of the impact of Covid and will provide for more teaching time in schools. As part of the junior cycle, students normally complete a number of classroom-based assessments, CBAs, which have been reduced by 50%. The school also has autonomy in dealing with the CBAs regarding when they will be completed by students, with some exceptions. As CBAs are school-based assessments, schools have been advised that there are flexibilities in the windows for completion of the CBAs in light of particular circumstances within an individual school. The assessment task, which is usually assessed and marked by the SEC, will not be assessed in 2022 in the relevant subjects. Instead, the written examination will account for 100% of the marks, giving further time within the schools. Adjustments have been made to the requirements for practicals and coursework in subjects including, for example, music, home economics, art and technologies. No changes have been made to the other aspects of the examinations as these are already specific and very significant changes to their format. It is a recognition of the importance of running the exam for the first time in three years.	spk_344
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_25	I will be clear that 2022 is the first year that all the new subject specifications for junior cycle will be assessed by the SEC. Those specifications provide for a very flexible and wide-realm approach in respect of questions and options being made available to students. A number of significant adjustments have been made. I know from my own experience that the requirement that a number of CBAs take place for a subject is quite a time constraint within the classroom. Those have, therefore, been cut by 50%. The assessment task, another task that is time demanding within the classroom and the experience of what can be provided from a teaching and learning point of view, has been done away with this year. These are very significant and progressive steps forward. Other amendments have been made. For example, adjustments have been made to the requirements for practicals and coursework in particular subjects, such as music, home economics, art and technologies. It is important to recognise that there have been adjustments and changes to provide greater flexibility for junior cycle students.	spk_346
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_25	It is important to reiterate that there have been changes, amendments and alterations to the paper. The papers have been tailored to meet the needs of the class of 2022. I will again specifically reference, as somebody who has worked in the area, that it is a considerable benefit that the number of CBAs has been reduced by 50%. To address the time issue raised by the Deputy, I know it is also a considerable benefit that the assessment task no longer takes place. The adjustments that have been made to practicals, including those for music, home economics, art and technologies, are of significant benefit. It is also important to acknowledge that the junior cycle examination papers are completed in a booklet format, with students required to answer all questions. The papers are designed to assess the subject specifications in an integrated way, reflecting the way in which teachers’ expertise is used to plan for delivering the subjects using integrated strands and elements. Any adjustments made to these papers at this stage would make them fundamentally different from expectations and what students are expecting. They would be more likely to disadvantage rather than benefit students, while acknowledging yet again that there have been significant alterations to, and tailoring of, the papers to meet the needs of the class of 2022.	spk_348
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_26	As already outlined to the House, in recent weeks I attended a meeting with the advisory group on State examinations, which is representative of students, parents, teachers, managerial bodies, the further and higher education sector and the State Examinations Commission. Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a one-to one or bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter. I listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders had to say and examined each of their points.

As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run accredited grades in the same manner as had been done last year as junior cycle data was unavailable for 25%, or one in four, of our students.  The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers over and above those announced in August 2021 mean that candidates have greater choice in the papers, have less questions to answer and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, as I have previously outlined, in mathematics, where students would traditionally have ten questions to answer, they now have only six. This is in addition to previously announced changes such as the running of the oral examinations and music practical over the first week of the Easter break.  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the leaving certificate applied examinations have also been pushed out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination coursework. I have also confirmed that junior cycle examinations will take place this summer, which I think is also important. Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for junior cycle were published previously and provide for more teaching time in schools. As I outlined earlier, they include a reduction in the number of classroom-based assessments, the removal of the requirement to complete the assessment tasks and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests. I believe that the decision will provide the junior cycle and leaving certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education to be assessed and to enable them to progress.	spk_350
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_26	I reiterate that we are all very conscious of the difficulties of the past two years for the education sector and for wider society, but most specifically in this instance for our students. As I have previously outlined to the House, I have engaged with students, parents, teachers and school management bodies. There were four key points consistently raised by students, including the necessity to have clarity, which we have provided today. We were in a position to do that earlier this year than was achieved last year. The second point was that they would have greater choice in the examination papers. As I have outlined to the Deputy, we have achieved that for them. There is a significantly different examination being experienced by students in 2022 than was experienced by those in 2018 or 2019. The issue of grade inflation was a key point highlighted by students. Again, I have given the commitment today that the grade inflation of 2021 will be on a par for the class of 2022. On the accredited grades process and the issues around that, we did do work on that. There is an issue around the fact that one in four students do not have the junior cycle data.	spk_352
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_26	I thank the Deputies. On Deputy Murnane O'Connor's specific question with regard to the accommodation for students who have a significant illness, a bereavement or are impacted by Covid, it may have escaped the Deputy but I did announce some time ago that there is a contingency second sitting of the examination, which will take place immediately after the first sitting of the examination. This is for exceptional cases such as a medical issue pertaining to a student, a bereavement or an issue pertaining to Covid. I appreciate the points that have been raised in regard to the need to support the students in all aspects of their lives. Deputies will be aware that earlier this year we launched the Covid learning and support scheme for schools, which is not only a support scheme with additional hours and additional teaching resources for academic learning, but also for well-being initiatives within our schools. On the issue of senior cycle reform, I am enormously committed to senior cycle reform. It is something that we will be progressing. My objective is to ensure that we maximise the potential of all of our students and the assessment of their various skill sets, and provide pathways for them.	spk_355
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_27	As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, there has been significant growth in post-primary student numbers in the Swords area in recent years. Across the Swords school planning area, total post-primary enrolments have increased by over 800 pupils since 2011. Enrolments at Fingal Community College have grown by over 300 in that same timeframe and additional accommodation was provided at the school in 2015 and 2016 in order to address the increased pupil numbers. In the context of further increasing pupil numbers at Fingal Community College the school submitted an application for capital funding under my Department's additional school accommodation scheme. An interim solution to meet the needs of the school was put in place. However, as part of the assessment process for an additional school accommodation application my officials consider not just the existing enrolments at the school, but also anticipated future needs in order to make full and appropriate provision for both current and future students. To anticipate school place requirements, my Department uses a geographical information system, utilising statistical models, child benefit data, school enrolment figures, information on residential development activity, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets and other relevant data. The most recent projections of post-primary school place requirements in the Swords school planning area show continued growth in requirements over the coming years.  Having considered the existing accommodation at the school relative to both current and long-term needs in the area, it was determined that there should be significant additional permanent accommodation provision at Fingal Community College. However, the school site is extremely constrained and this presents significant challenges in delivering the required volume of accommodation. In that context, my Department is working to formulate an appropriate long-term plan to meet the needs of the school and deliver the required accommodation in consultation with the school's patron, Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board, ETB.A number of potential options are being explored in this regard and the Deputy will appreciate that to identify the optimum solution for this school, it is necessary to undertake a full and thorough technical appraisal of these options, which takes some time. Pending the delivery of this long-term solution, the Department will continue to work with Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB as school patron to ensure any necessary interim accommodation requirements are met.	spk_357
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_27	I appreciate the case that the Deputy makes. I recognise the necessity for the area.

That is presenting considerable challenges in delivering the required volume of accommodation necessary for the school. It is a tribute to the school that it is growing. The Department is heavily committed to working to formulate an appropriate long-term solution to meet the accommodation needs of the school. We are doing that. I acknowledge the co-operation of the school's patron, Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB. A number of different, appropriate options are being explored. The Deputy will appreciate that, for every option, there needs to be a considered evaluation and that is a time constraint. I assure the Deputy that priority is being given to this matter.	spk_359

I appreciate their points and the acknowledgement there is an absolute commitment on the part of the Department to the advancement of the school Deputy Farrell mentioned. On the point raised by Deputy Crowe, I can confirm the school to which he referred has been approved for a project under the Department's additional accommodation scheme. The project will provide for one mainstream classroom and a two-classroom special educational needs base. I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that the Department approved this project to proceed to construction in May of 2021. The project is currently on site. The school has recently submitted a request for additional funding for the project to provide a sensory garden, hard play and soft play areas and six car parking spaces. I am pleased to inform the Deputy of our agreement in principle to provide the additional funding in question, subject to agreement being reached on the costs associated with the proposal. My officials have written to the school to seek further information and clarification on the cost of these additions, including whether cost-saving measures can be achieved.	spk_366

I believe the decision will provide the junior cycle and leaving certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end.	spk_382
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_29	I must point out to the Deputy that if an answer given the first time is honest, fair and accurate, it will be the same answer I give him the second and, indeed, third and fourth time. If it is a truthful answer first time, it will remain a truthful answer. I have given a truthful answer in this House as regards my engagements, the deliberations concerning leaving certificate 2022 and the junior cycle, engagements I had with the advisory group, parents, students and teachers, the issues that were raised with me by students, in particular, where they asked for clarity and for greater choice in their examinations, which we delivered upon today. I outlined for the Deputy earlier what they were. Issues of grade inflation were raised by many around the table at the advisory group, which I delivered upon today. Issues regarding accredited grades were raised. I very clearly pointed out to this House in an honest answer the difficulty in that we could not implement accredited grades this year in a similar and fair fashion to how that was implemented last year. For that reason, I maintain the answers I gave the first, second and, indeed, third time	spk_384
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_29	I want to be clear that the reason the hybrid model or accredited grades aspect is not being implemented this year is that when a teacher provides an estimated mark, he or she does so because he or she knows his or her student.He or she does not know the student in another class whom the teacher has not taught. It is important that there is comparability between the students in a national examination. To achieve that comparability, as I have outlined earlier, we relied upon the junior cycle data belonging to the class of that year group. One in four of the class of 2022 does not have those data. Therefore, we were not in a position to provide the accredited grades in as fair a manner as was provided to the students last year. That is the honest reason as to what has transpired.  I want to be clear that I am committed to senior cycle reform. I am conscious that we need to find a mechanism that can assess the various talents, abilities and skill sets of our students in the widest possible manner. That needs to be incorporated into senior cycle, as indeed does the maximum potential for students going forward to choose whatever pathway they might wish to choose. I am completely committed to it. 	spk_387

Dúnadh le déanaí comhairliúchán leis an gComhairle Náisiúnta Curaclaim agus Measúnachta, CNCM, ar dhréacht-sonraíochtaí nua do Ghaeilge na hardteistiméireachta. Tá forbairt reatha na ndréacht-sonraíochtaí do Ghaeilge na hardteistiméireachta mar chuid den timthriall leanúnach athbhreithnithe agus athfhorbartha curaclaim. As the Deputy is aware, the public consultation aspect of his process recently concluded. It deals with the new draft specifications for leaving certificate Irish. The current development of draft specifications for leaving certificate Irish is part of the ongoing cycle of curriculum review and redevelopment. As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, opened the consultation process. In response to stakeholder concerns and requests, it extended the closing date at the end of November 2021. To support stakeholder participation, the NCCA employed a wide range of consultation tools, including an online survey, bilateral and focus group meetings and written submissions. The NCCA is conducting a detailed analysis of all feedback that is received. It is hoped that an interim consultation report will be presented to the NCCA council in June. A report on early enactment of Irish at junior cycle is also due to be presented to the NCCA council shortly. I look forward to the outcomes of these processes in due course. 	spk_389
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	Curaclam Scoile	dbsect_30	I thank the Deputy. I know that he has a particular and passionate interest in this. He have raised it on an ongoing basis with me. With all due respect, it has been raised by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and indeed by others here. I wish to acknowledge that there has been considerable engagement via the consultation process. For example, the NCCA has received some 740 responses in the online survey, as well as 240 written submissions. In addition, the NCCA hosted 13 focus group meetings in which there were 275 participants. Some eight bilateral meetings were held, and 19 individual interviews were held with teachers. Therefore, there has been significant engagement. That engagement is important because it will inform the ultimate decision that is made. To respect that process, it is important that I allow the analysis of that feedback, as well as the varied views, I have no doubt, that have been offered. We should allow that to be completed.	spk_391
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-02-01	dail	33	Curaclam Scoile	dbsect_30	I need to say that it is important in every sector, including in the education sector, that the widest realm of people who are involved in the process have an opportunity to put and to record their views and their thoughts. I accept the passionately and sincerely held views that have been articulated by both Deputies here. However, it is important, in the interest of fairness and the interests of the process, that all views and all shades of views would be facilitated in having their voices heard. That is exactly what this consultation process has been about, namely, facilitating similarities of views as well as dissimilarity of views. I have no doubt that there will be competing views expressed here via this process. I accept that the publication of the conclusion of this process needs to be done as a matter of priority. It will be done. However, it is important that the considered views of everybody who engaged - and the Deputies will can see that it has been a huge engagement by people - would be given due consideration.	spk_394

I welcome the opportunity to speak to the House on the important matter of the State examinations. I understand the sentiments and concerns underlying the motion and I appreciate that examination year students have faced significant challenges in their learning as a result of the disruption caused by Covid-19. I also acknowledge that these students are eager to have certainty about the approach to be taken to this year's State examinations. The Department of Education and I are currently involved in a process of engagement with education stakeholders regarding the 2022 State examinations. It is important that this process be allowed to conclude to inform the decision that will be taken. Consequently, the Government is tabling an amendment to allow this process to conclude. I welcome the opportunity to update Deputies on the progress of the engagements to date. I also want to advise of measures that have to date been put in place by my Department and by the SEC to help address the disruption to teaching and learning caused to leaving certificate students as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. I am keen to lean on the wisdom of all in the education sector in helping to provide certainty to our examination students as soon as possible and to allow them to focus on their preparations for the 2022 leaving certificate. It is important to hear and understand all voices and perspectives in respect of the most appropriate approach to the 2022 State examinations. Most important is the need for clarity for students. In this regard, I welcome the opportunity this evening to hear the views of Deputies on these important issues. My Department and the SEC have been progressing planning for the 2022 junior cycle and leaving certificate examinations. This has been done in close consultation with the advisory group on planning for the State examinations and, of course, with public health. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers and school leaders as well as representatives from the SEC, NCCA, higher education and my Department. I acknowledge the significant contributions made by all members of the advisory group to the work on planning for the examinations. I pay tribute to the extraordinary and unstinting efforts being made every day by school communities up and down the country to support the continuity of learning for students during what has been a challenging time. I am aware that the leaving certificate experience for the class of 2022 has been disruptive. The SEC, working with the Department of Education, has sought through a range of measures to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by these students. Adjustments have been made to the assessment arrangements that were announced in August 2021 for the 2022 state examinations. These adjustments were designed to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by students in the early part of 2021 as well as provide for some possible further disruption in the 2021-22 school year. They are considered proportionate to the students' experience and loss of learning and are educationally appropriate. They also ensure that the overall structure of the examinations remains intact but will allow for greater choice for students. Just before Christmas, I made an announcement regarding the arrangements for leaving certificate oral examinations in Irish and modern foreign languages and the practical performance tests in leaving certificate music. These examinations will take place outside of school time over the first week of the Easter holidays with the examinations running in schools during the six-day period from Saturday, 9 April to Thursday, 14 April, inclusive. Holding these examinations over Easter and outside of school time will minimise disruption for schools and students. Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the leaving certificate applied examinations have been pushed out. There has also been a reduction in the amount of preparatory time required for some practical exams in order to give more time for tuition. Schools have been reminded of the available flexibility in terms of the dates for the completion and authentication of leaving certificate course work. I also announced that an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations would be run in 2022 shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations. This will be for students who are unable to sit the main set of exams for specific reasons.In addition to those measures focused on exam year students, I have announced a series of broader measures to enhance teaching and learning in our schools.  With a view to increasing the supply of substitute post-primary teachers to cover teachers absent from school for Covid-related or other reasons, I have introduced a range of emergency measures to provide increased numbers of substitute teachers. These include the release of student teachers from their college programmes to enable them to support schools; the cancellation of all teacher continuing professional development that gives rise to substitution needs; the deployment of teachers currently serving with the school support services to work in schools; requests to retired teachers to return to teaching duties; the ending of the abatement of salary payments to retired teachers for substitution work for this school term; a relaxation of career break and job-sharing restrictions for substitution purposes; and permission for post-primary teachers to work more than 22 hours per week, working extra hours to provide substitution cover, up to a total of 35 hours. The capacity of the school system to provide for remote tuition has improved significantly in recent times. While schools were closed as a result of Covid-19 from January 2021, all students, including students who are due to sit the 2022 leaving certificate examinations, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools from 11 January 2021 until their return to in-person tuition. Fifth year students were also prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students in spring of 2021. I have introduced measures to address the greater impact on the education of some students and the learning loss suffered by them. These include the opportunity provided to primary and post-primary schools to offer summer provision, at a cost of up to €40 million, in addition to the €10 million allocated to a supplementary education programme, aimed at students with complex educational needs. In addition to this, provision of up to €52 million in extra teaching hours was made by the Department for the Covid learning and support scheme, under which a block of additional teaching hours is provided to each recognised school, from which schools can provide additional teaching support for students who have experienced difficulties in settling back into school and engaging with learning. Information has also been provided on well-being supports for leaving certificate students. This includes a series of supports on managing well-being, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in the Department, to support students. My Department has worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure that the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students. As I have outlined previously, I continue to engage with all the partners in education on all matters relating to the leaving certificate 2022 examinations. At the most recent meeting of the State examinations advisory group a number of updates were received from group members, including reports of emerging and final results from surveys of their members which were conducted by some bodies. The meeting was positive and collaborative, with all parties committed to continued engagement in the short period ahead to provide clarity on the State examinations in 2022. It was agreed that the members of the group would reflect on the contributions made at the meeting and that engagement would continue between me and the various stakeholders on a bilateral and intensive basis. This bilateral engagement has continued since last week, over the weekend and into this week, with a view to reaching an appropriate solution that responds to the concerns and issues that have been raised by students and other stakeholders. A further meeting of the advisory group will be held and I am working towards a decision on the State examinations in 2022 being made as soon as is reasonably practicable. I am mindful that, under Standing Order 59, I am permitted to speak only once to the motion. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will close the debate on behalf of the Government. I commend once again all those working in schools to support students. The work of those who support students - teachers, school leaders, SNAs, bus escorts, secretaries and caretakers - has never been more important or more challenging. Those in examination years face added challenge beyond what is faced in normal years. My Government colleagues and I appreciate the need to bring clarity to the position for these students as soon as possible in order that they can focus on their preparations for the upcoming exams. I will continue to engage with stakeholders with the aim of reaching an appropriate solution as quickly as possible. I commend the Government amendment to the House."	spk_299
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-01-25	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_30	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it allows me to provide an update on the current position on the planned development of the new three-school campus at Carrigtohill. I know of the Deputy's ongoing interest and I also know the interest of Deputies Stanton and O'Connor, who have consistently raised the matter with me also. Carrigtwohill Community College is a co-educational post-primary school under the patronage of Cork Education and Training Board and the Diocese of Cloyne. The school first opened its doors in August 2016 and is located in interim accommodation at Unit 2A, Fota Business Park, Carrigtohill. The brief for the project is to provide a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school with a three-classroom special educational needs unit. Scoil Chlíodhna Community National School is a co-educational primary school which opened in September 2015 and is currently in interim accommodation at Carrigtwohill GAA sports complex. The brief for the project is to provide a new 24-classroom primary school with a three-classroom special educational needs unit. Scoil Mhuire Naofa National School is a co-educational primary school and is under the patronage of the Catholic Bishop of Cloyne. The school is currently located on a parish-owned site consisting of ten permanent classrooms with seven classes in temporary accommodation on site. The brief for the project is to provide a new 24-classroom school with a three-classroom special educational needs unit. It is an impressive testament to the ambitious plans that this campus will be the largest single-school building project ever undertaken by the Department and will serve a school community of 2,400 pupils. As the Deputy has outlined, there have been difficulties with planning. A planning application for the permanent accommodation for the three schools was lodged in March 2019. A request for further information was received in August 2019. A final grant of planning permission was received on 6 July 2020. In 2021, my Department engaged with a third-party contractor regarding the road network which is required to be constructed by that party to facilitate the schools building projects. The construction of the roads is now approaching completion, which is very positive. In 2021, the Department established a design and build contractors framework to which design and build projects are tendered. The project for the Carrigtohill campus was tendered to this framework on 14 June 2021. Since the commencement of the tender process, the Department has explicitly required potential tenderers to prioritise the completion of the community college first within the campus. The tenders were returned on 27 October 2021 and the tender assessment report from my Department's project manager has been recently received by my Department and is currently under review. It is anticipated that the letter of intent to appoint the building contractor will issue in the coming weeks in quarter 1. Once the successful contractor is appointed, the Department's technical team will immediately liaise with the contractor to ensure that the delivery of the community college is prioritised within the contractor's programme of works. Throughout construction, the Department's technical team will ensure that a sharp focus is maintained on delivering the finished community college as early as possible within the campus construction programme.	spk_481

Deputy Buckley specifically referenced the wider area of east Cork. I am personally very familiar with the area because I spent time teaching there. I am very conscious of its needs and demands given that it is a growing area. I appreciate the high priority that is being placed on the future of this three-school campus. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. It will be a significant achievement for Carrigtwohill Community College, Scoil Chlíodhna Community National School and Scoil Mhuire Naofa National School. It is a very ambitious project and undertaking by the Department of Education, and will be the largest campus we have ever delivered. The Department is acutely aware of the need to provide modern permanent new school buildings for these three schools and we are acting proactively to do all that we can to deliver this as a matter of priority. As the Deputy has indicated, it is very heartening for people to see, for example, the roads, which are very important for the delivery of the project, now nearing completion. The Deputy also highlighted the other aspects. I assure him that every possible priority is being given to the project. As I indicated, we are looking at the letter of intent being issued in quarter 1.

Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-01-19	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_15	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to outline the current position regarding provision for children with special education needs, including autism. In fairness, I acknowledge his ongoing engagement with me and his very clear and specific interest in this area of education. I thank him for that. Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for this Government. This year, the Department of Education will invest in excess of €2 billion or more than 25% of the Department's budget in special education needs support. As a result, the numbers of special education needs teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels in this country. Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 386% from 548 to 2,118 for the 2021-22 school year. Of these, 1,854 special classes cater for students with autism. Throughout 2020 and 2021, the Department of Education and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process, which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year. This approach is delivering. This intensive intervention has seen an additional 269 special classes providing more than 1,600 new places opened nationwide for the 2021-22 school year. Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can between them cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full co-operation of the schools in areas where they are required. There are, however, some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special classes or special school places. I know this can cause much anguish for the parents and families involved. There is currently a network of 357 special classes in Cork of which 309 are special classes for children with autism. Of those, 228 are at primary level, including 21 early intervention classes and 81 at post-primary level. A total of 45 new special classes were established for the 2021-22 school year. The NCSE, through its network of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022-23 school year and beyond. The council is looking at local information with regard to projected demand for future special education places, particularly to cater for students with autism who have associated complex needs. Budget 2022 has provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022-23 school year. These additional classes will provide more than 1,700 new places this year. This additional provision will bring the total number of special classes to more than 2,400 in the 2022-23 school year. The provision of special school places in Cork was also significantly increased for the 2021-22 school year with the opening of a new special school in Carrigaline. The number of places available in this school will again increase for September 2022 and work is also progressing on the expansion of an existing special school in Rochestown. Overall, budget 2022 has provided for an additional 23 teaching pots and 46 SNA posts in special schools nationwide, which will create an additional 140 special school places in 2022.	spk_269
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-01-19	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_15	I thank the Deputy again for raising this issue and for the opportunity to reassure the House that the Department is committed to ensuring that all children can access an education suitable to their needs. Planning is actively under way to ensure that children without a placement for next year are provided with a suitable placement. The NCSE is leading work in this regard. I reassure the Deputy that the Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education. Considerable work is undertaken with schools on the ground and this has proven successful, notwithstanding the issues the Deputy has raised and the need to continue to engage with schools in this respect. I want to again emphasise that there is a huge commitment from the point of view of the Department to accelerate provision of school places and special schools. Considerable progress has been made in this very short time span since the formation of this Government. It is a significant recognition that almost 25% of the budget now is being expended on special education and rightly so. Beyond that, specific interventions, for example, budget 2021, provided an additional 990 SNAs and this resulted in more than 18,000 SNAs being allocated to schools by the end of December in 2021. Budget 2022 then provides funding for an additional 1,165 SNAs to provide support to children with special education needs, which will bring the total number of SNAs in this country to more than 19,169 at the end of December 2022. As I said, provision for 19,169 SNAs at the end of the year will represent an increase of 81% since 2011, at which time 10,575 SNAs were provided for.Budget 2021 also provided for an additional 145 special educational teachers, bringing the provision to 13,765. Budget 2022 provides for the creation of an additional 980 new teaching posts in special education. This new investment is required to meet the needs of students with special educational needs. The point is that there is an ongoing commitment to address the issues that arise in staffing and supports for students, as well as the provision of places for students with additional needs.	spk_271
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-01-19	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_15	I thank Deputies for raising this issue and for allowing me to address the matter. At the outset, I would like to say that I am very much aware of the disruption experienced by students who are due to take their leaving certificate examinations this year in the class of 2022. It is welcome that the schools reopened at the normal time after the Christmas holidays. I know that schools are working tirelessly to deliver the best possible educational experience to students. It is important to say that. All planning for the 2022 examinations is guided by the prevailing public health advice and it will have regard to the well-being of students. The Department of Education continues to engage with the partners in education on all matters relating to the leaving certificate 2022 examinations. The next meeting of the advisory group on the State examinations is planned for tomorrow. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers and school leaders, as well as representatives from the State Examinations Commission, SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, higher education and my Department. Adjustments to the examination papers for the 2022 State examinations were announced in August 2021. These adjustments were designed to take account of both the disruption to learning experience by students in the early part of 2021, as well as providing for some possible further disruption in the 2021-22 academic school year. The adjustments ensure that the overall structure of the examinations remains intact, but allow for greater choicer for students. Revised arrangements for leaving certificate oral examinations in Irish, in the modern foreign languages and the practical performance tests in leaving certificate music were announced last month. These examinations will now take place outside of school time over the first week of school Easter holidays. By moving these examinations to the Easter holidays, the State Examinations Commission aims to minimise disruption to teaching and learning, especially for those candidates preparing for the examinations, as this change will specifically limit teacher absence from schools. The State Examinations Commission also recently provided further information to schools regarding aspects of the 2022 State examinations. This included postponing commencement of assessment of what is known as the leaving certificate applied February tasks from 31 January to 14 February. Schools were also reminded of the flexibility which is available regarding the dates for completion and authentication of coursework for leaving certificate candidates. I have also announced that an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations will be run in 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations. This will be for students who are unable to set the main set of examinations for various reasons, including Covid-19 illness, bereavement or serious illness. Finally, the Department of Education has also provided a suite of guidance materials agreed with the educational partners to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils and students in a Covid-19 context. The Department of Education will continue to engage with all partners in education on all matters relating to the leaving certificate 2022 examinations. As I said, the meeting of the advisory group on planning for State examinations 2022 has been planned for tomorrow, Thursday. As previously outlined, this group represents the widest possible experience of stakeholders in education, students, parents, teachers and managerial bodies. It is important that this advisory group has been in operation for a considerable amount of time. Their last meeting was on 20 December, where the decision around the final arrangements as regards the examinations for the orals and the musical practicals was taken. The next meeting will take place tomorrow. I look forward to that opportunity tomorrow to hear again the views, thoughts and experiences of everybody around the table. They have played a vital role up to this point in determining how we proceed. It is important that they be afforded the opportunity also tomorrow.	spk_277
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-01-19	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_15	I again thank the Deputies for their contributions. I will note them. In my previous response, I took the opportunity to outline the progress and consultation that has taken place to this point. It has been a process of progress and consultation, which is important. As I have already outlined, it is a consultation with the widest possible representation of stakeholders through the advisory body. That includes students and they have been very much part of the process, which continues tomorrow. That is right and proper. It has been the hallmark of progress to this point for the leaving certificate in 2022 and equally so for those in 2020 and 2021. I emphasise that I am acutely aware of the disruption caused to students who are taking the exam in 2022. The Department will continue to engage with education stakeholders to ensure the best interests of all students are at the heart of all decisions made relating to the leaving certificate in 2022. There was ongoing engagement in planning prior to the return to school when plans were put in place for accommodations to exam papers. As I outlined earlier, other accommodations such as second sittings of exams and the provision of exams at Easter outside of school time will be made. There will be a further opportunity tomorrow to hear all voices and opinions at the advisory group meeting in what has always been an open and constructive manner. An opportunity will be afforded to each of the stakeholders tomorrow to articulate their views, experiences and representative thoughts and ideas on the next stages of development for the process. I look forward to that opportunity. I have always supported the opportunity for the widest possible stakeholder engagement, including with students, and I will continue to do that. It is a proper process and it is right and proper that that opportunity be facilitated tomorrow.	spk_283
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-01-19	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to outline the current position regarding provision for children with special education needs, including autism. In fairness, I acknowledge his ongoing engagement with me and his very clear and specific interest in this area of education. I thank him for that. Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for this Government. This year, the Department of Education will invest in excess of €2 billion or more than 25% of the Department's budget in special education needs support. As a result, the numbers of special education needs teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels in this country. Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 386% from 548 to 2,118 for the 2021-22 school year. Of these, 1,854 special classes cater for students with autism. Throughout 2020 and 2021, the Department of Education and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process, which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year. This approach is delivering. This intensive intervention has seen an additional 269 special classes providing more than 1,600 new places opened nationwide for the 2021-22 school year. Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can between them cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full co-operation of the schools in areas where they are required. There are, however, some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special classes or special school places. I know this can cause much anguish for the parents and families involved. There is currently a network of 357 special classes in Cork of which 309 are special classes for children with autism. Of those, 228 are at primary level, including 21 early intervention classes and 81 at post-primary level. A total of 45 new special classes were established for the 2021-22 school year. The NCSE, through its network of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022-23 school year and beyond. The council is looking at local information with regard to projected demand for future special education places, particularly to cater for students with autism who have associated complex needs. Budget 2022 has provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022-23 school year. These additional classes will provide more than 1,700 new places this year. This additional provision will bring the total number of special classes to more than 2,400 in the 2022-23 school year. The provision of special school places in Cork was also significantly increased for the 2021-22 school year with the opening of a new special school in Carrigaline. The number of places available in this school will again increase for September 2022 and work is also progressing on the expansion of an existing special school in Rochestown. Overall, budget 2022 has provided for an additional 23 teaching pots and 46 SNA posts in special schools nationwide, which will create an additional 140 special school places in 2022.	spk_269
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-01-19	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy again for raising this issue and for the opportunity to reassure the House that the Department is committed to ensuring that all children can access an education suitable to their needs. Planning is actively under way to ensure that children without a placement for next year are provided with a suitable placement. The NCSE is leading work in this regard. I reassure the Deputy that the Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education. Considerable work is undertaken with schools on the ground and this has proven successful, notwithstanding the issues the Deputy has raised and the need to continue to engage with schools in this respect. I want to again emphasise that there is a huge commitment from the point of view of the Department to accelerate provision of school places and special schools. Considerable progress has been made in this very short time span since the formation of this Government. It is a significant recognition that almost 25% of the budget now is being expended on special education and rightly so. Beyond that, specific interventions, for example, budget 2021, provided an additional 990 SNAs and this resulted in more than 18,000 SNAs being allocated to schools by the end of December in 2021. Budget 2022 then provides funding for an additional 1,165 SNAs to provide support to children with special education needs, which will bring the total number of SNAs in this country to more than 19,169 at the end of December 2022. As I said, provision for 19,169 SNAs at the end of the year will represent an increase of 81% since 2011, at which time 10,575 SNAs were provided for.Budget 2021 also provided for an additional 145 special educational teachers, bringing the provision to 13,765. Budget 2022 provides for the creation of an additional 980 new teaching posts in special education. This new investment is required to meet the needs of students with special educational needs. The point is that there is an ongoing commitment to address the issues that arise in staffing and supports for students, as well as the provision of places for students with additional needs.	spk_271
Norma Foley	50	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2022-01-19	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_19	I thank Deputies for raising this issue and for allowing me to address the matter. At the outset, I would like to say that I am very much aware of the disruption experienced by students who are due to take their leaving certificate examinations this year in the class of 2022. It is welcome that the schools reopened at the normal time after the Christmas holidays. I know that schools are working tirelessly to deliver the best possible educational experience to students. It is important to say that. All planning for the 2022 examinations is guided by the prevailing public health advice and it will have regard to the well-being of students. The Department of Education continues to engage with the partners in education on all matters relating to the leaving certificate 2022 examinations. The next meeting of the advisory group on the State examinations is planned for tomorrow. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers and school leaders, as well as representatives from the State Examinations Commission, SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, higher education and my Department. Adjustments to the examination papers for the 2022 State examinations were announced in August 2021. These adjustments were designed to take account of both the disruption to learning experience by students in the early part of 2021, as well as providing for some possible further disruption in the 2021-22 academic school year. The adjustments ensure that the overall structure of the examinations remains intact, but allow for greater choicer for students. Revised arrangements for leaving certificate oral examinations in Irish, in the modern foreign languages and the practical performance tests in leaving certificate music were announced last month. These examinations will now take place outside of school time over the first week of school Easter holidays. By moving these examinations to the Easter holidays, the State Examinations Commission aims to minimise disruption to teaching and learning, especially for those candidates preparing for the examinations, as this change will specifically limit teacher absence from schools.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-16	dail	33	Covid-19: Statements	dbsect_34	"I am pleased to be here today with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to provide the House with an update on the important measures that we have taken to address the continuing impact of Covid-19 on the educational experience of our children and young people. The operation of schools has been and continues to be a key priority for the Government. I do not underestimate for a moment the significant challenge that the pandemic has presented for schools in their operation and in their everyday running. I sincerely acknowledge the hard work and commitment of all education partners, working together with the Department of Education and public health, to ensure that our schools have been in a position to operate throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. I also acknowledge the work of public health, whose support has been critical in these efforts. As Members will be aware, the operation of schools is vital for our children and young people. From social development, to academic learning, to well-being, school is a crucial service for them. If the Covid-19 pandemic has shown us anything, it is the vital importance of our education system. Significant resources have been made available to schools throughout the pandemic to support them in their continued operation. However, the education system is not defined by Covid-19. Budget 2022 includes a number of investments in our education system that will create a stronger, brighter future for our learners. We have further reduced the primary staffing schedule from the present historic low of 25:1 to 24:1 from September 2022 onwards. The primary staffing schedule reduced by one point, to an historic low level of 25:1, in 2021 and further investment in new teaching posts will see the general average reduced to 24:1 in 2022. We have provided an additional annual allocation to the DEIS programme of €18 million in 2022, growing to €23 million the following year. Together with a further one point improvement in the staffing schedule for DEIS urban band 1 schools, this will create the largest ever education package to tackle educational disadvantage and represents an increase of more than 20% in funding for the DEIS programme in 2022 and 2023. The budget for 2022 includes a capital allocation of €20 million to schools for the purchase of books, audiobooks and other media for the purposes of improving their existing literacy resource banks. This funding is additional to that given for the school book rental scheme and is intended to promote the joy of literature, words and reading within our schools and classrooms. The budget also seeks to support our excellent school leaders by extending administrative principal status to all teaching principals in schools with two or more special classes, or in special schools where a principal was previously a teaching principal. Furthermore, provision has been made for a minimum of one day of administrative leave per week for teaching principals. I look forward to advancing these initiatives, together with our partners in education. The Department has always been guided by advice from our public health authorities, including NPHET and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, in respect of the infection prevention and control measures appropriate for schools. We are appreciative of the priority and guidance these expert bodies have provided to the education sector throughout the pandemic and we continue to engage with them where further measures are recommended or needed. The wearing of face masks by children aged nine years and older in a number of settings, including for children in third class and above in primary schools, has now been introduced on a temporary basis and will be subject to review in mid-February 2022. A set of frequently asked questions relating to face masks and face coverings in primary schools was published online and sent directly to primary schools. The FAQs provide further guidance to schools regarding the use of face masks or face coverings in the third to sixth class cohort. Advice from the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, on supporting children in wearing face coverings in primary schools was also published online and forwarded to schools. Further resources have also been published by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA. As I have set out previously, any engagement between parents and schools will take place in a spirit of partnership and co-operation to ensure the safety of the whole school community. The guidance seeks a solution-focused approach between schools and parents to resolve any issues that may arise. Where significant issues have not been resolved locally, contact should be made with the Department’s Covid-19 support helpline by email or telephone and a departmental inspector will provide further support. The guidance recognises that in the case of certain children with additional needs, schools may be already aware of difficulties they may face regarding the appropriate use of face coverings. Schools will be best placed to identify those children whose complex needs are such that the wearing of face coverings may not be possible for them, and to discuss this with parents and guardians as required. In such circumstances, schools do not require medical certification to provide an exemption to the wearing of face coverings. The Chief Medical Officer recently confirmed that it is his view that there is a role for the use of antigen tests as an additional tool in our schools. The Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with the Department of Education, have introduced a programme where antigen tests will be made available to children in primary schools when a case of Covid-19 arises. Parents and guardians of a primary schoolchild with a confirmed case of Covid-19 following a PCR test are asked to inform their school’s principal. The school principal will then inform the parents of other children in the pod of a confirmed case. Where there are two cases in a class in more than one pod within a seven-day period, antigen testing is being made available to every child in the class. It is important that parents inform principals quickly if a child receives a ""detected"" PCR test for Covid-19. By doing this, the choice to participate in antigen testing can be offered to other parents quickly. It is important that everyone continues to follow all the public health advice in using this new programme. No personal details of the child will be shared. These parents will be provided with the option to receive free antigen tests for their child, which they will be able to order using a freephone number or online portal for delivery to their home. It is not mandatory for children to participate in antigen testing. Children who are in a pod where a child has tested positive for Covid-19 can continue to attend school whether or not they participate in antigen testing. School principals will not be required to gather evidence of participation or of any antigen test results. Information materials for parents have been shared with schools and publicised directly to parents.  While Covid-19 has had an effect on all aspects of education, it is clear that some students have been impacted more than others, especially students with additional educational needs and those who are at risk of educational disadvantage. The Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS, was introduced to mitigate the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on learning loss and well-being arising from the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021. Under the programme, a block of additional teaching hours is being provided to schools, from which each school can provide additional teaching support for the pupils who have experienced difficulties in settling back into school and engaging with learning. These hours are additional to any other teaching hours allocated to the school, such as special education teacher or English as an additional language hours. Schools have the flexibility to identify the pupils who have been most affected by the school closures, and schools can use these additional hours throughout the year to support these students. It is a matter for each school to recruit the teachers required to provide the hours or, alternatively, a school can offer additional teaching hours to teachers already in the school who have less than full teaching contracts. Any registered teacher may be recruited to provide CLASS hours, irrespective of whether the teacher is otherwise employed by the school. Ventilation is one part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19. Updated guidance for schools on practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices was provided in early May. The guidance outlines that CO2 monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas and rooms may not be adequately ventilated. As such, a number of portable CO2 monitors were sent directly to primary and secondary schools as part of a free scheme. In excess of 36,000 monitors have been provided. To assist schools with this work, the Department recently announced the payment of a minor works grant totalling €45 million for primary schools and special schools as part of additional support in the context of Covid-19, and €17 million was allocated for post-primary schools. Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can use their minor works grant, including for the purchase of HEPA air cleaners where identified as necessary. Schools may also apply for emergency works grant assistance to address larger-scale issues, as has always been the procedure.  Well-being is a central focus of schools and the Department. Specific supports have been put in place for schools to allow for well-being measures. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to address the House. I am very appreciative of the tremendous support that has been given by all our partners in education and the school communities on the ground, as well as Deputies, in what has been a particularly unprecedented time in the education sector. I am appreciative of their support and I wish them a happy Christmas."	spk_232
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House, as he has requested, the current position regarding Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in schools. Ensuring that schools can continue to operate through Covid-19 has been a key priority for the Government. The Department always has been guided by our public health authorities, such as NPHET, the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, regarding the appropriate Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in place in schools. Additional funding and staff have been made available to schools to support the implementation of these measures. Furthermore, I would like to record again that I am deeply appreciative of the strong work that has taken place and continues to take place on the ground in schools around the country to implement these public health measures. As the Deputy will be aware, there have been a number of additional measures recommended by public health recently. First, the Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with the Department of Education, recently commenced a programme in which antigen tests are made available to children in primary schools when a case of Covid-19 arises. The Deputy will be aware that there were varying views at various times in regard to the effectiveness of antigen testing, but it is now the strong recommendation of the CMO that there is a place for antigen testing as an additional tool to augment all of the other tools that are in our schools. For that reason, as public health have recommended it, it is now going forward.Information materials for parents were shared with schools last week and publicised directly to parents. It has been referenced that, following recent advice from NPHET, the Government has approved the wearing of face masks by children aged nine years and older in a number of settings, including for children in third class and above in primary schools. Guidance has issued to primary schools on this basis, setting out the recommendation and the exemptions which apply in respect of children with medical or special needs. Of course, it may be difficult for some students with special needs or certain medical issues to wear face coverings. Schools know their children and are best placed to identify those children whose complex needs are such that the wearing of face coverings may not be possible for them and to discuss this with parents as required. Schools have been provided with guidance and information for parents and children. It is expected that schools, as usual, will take a practical approach over the next day or two, as has been communicated, in order to communicate the new measures to parents and ensure parents have the opportunity to provide masks to children. The measure is being introduced on a temporary basis and is subject to review in mid-February 2022. The Deputy will appreciate that this is a public health measure. It is guided by public health. It is the strong recommendation of the CMO and NPHET that this is an additional tool for our schools. The decision was taken yesterday but schools have been given the latitude over the coming days to engage with parents and students on the wearing of face masks. I confirm that this well-being approach is typical of the approach we have taken since the reopening of schools. It is a public health measure in the best interests of children, as advised by public health for the protection of children, individually and collectively, and the school community.	spk_7
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House these measures. I reiterate that if there are outbreaks of concern in educational facilities, public health teams continue to provide support to schools where required and the measures we have implemented in schools are on the back of expert public health advice. The on-the-ground experience of public health doctors has been and remains that schools are relatively low-risk environments in terms of transmission and have not been a driver of transmission in children over the course of the pandemic. That has been reiterated by our CMO and NPHET on an ongoing basis.	spk_9
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_3	The Government is committed to supporting schools and keeping them open for all children as we continue to live with Covid-19. The aim of all the Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in place in schools is to support schools to operate safely and prevent the introduction and onward transmission of Covid-19 among the school community. I will speak specifically on the measures confirmed by the Government yesterday and the guidelines issued to schools. It is important because I have heard from the Deputy and others about the necessity to get the guidelines in place as a matter of urgency. Guidelines are required-----	spk_11
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_3	We did that yesterday and are very clear in the guidelines. I know schools and have spent the vast majority of my working life in schools.	spk_13

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_3	In relation to there being an opportunity for schools to take a flexible approach, as they always do, they have that flexibility in the coming days. The vast majority of parents are aware, as I am, that many children wore masks on the word of the CMO last week. We are taking an approach advised by public health. The measure is regarded as an additional tool for the benefit of our schools and we are implementing it. We ask parents to co-operate as they have done magnificently up to this point. I have no doubt they will do so going forward. It is operating seamlessly at second level. This is a mirror reflection of a measure regarded by public health as a public health measure. On resources going into schools, about which the Deputy made an inference, over €700 million has been expended on resources being made available to schools for a variety of infection prevention and control measures. Ventilation is considered on a case-by-case basis, as the Deputy will appreciate, because no two schools have the same requirements. It is the strong advice that natural ventilation is best but where there are specific issues, the Department has engaged on a case-by-case basis with schools, whether it is for increased vents, windows or whatever. Moneys have been paid, work has been done and if HEPA filters are required, that is also a measure.	spk_19
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_3	I acknowledge the Deputy's ongoing commitment to this issue in his constituency. It is an issue on which Deputy Aindrias Moynihan has also engaged with me. I thank Deputy Creed for raising the matter, as it allows me to provide an update to the House on the current position on the provision of interim accommodation for Le Chéile Secondary School in Ballincollig, County Cork. In September 2021, the school opened in contingency interim accommodation in the former Cork Film Centre in Ballincollig. The school will operate in interim accommodation pending delivery of its permanent school project. As the Deputy outlined, the Department of Education had sought planning permission from Cork City Council for the planned interim accommodation for the school on the grounds of Ballincollig GAA Club. That planning application has been refused by Cork City Council. At the moment, my Department is exploring what other options may be available, but it is proving difficult. Having done this previously, my Department had identified the Ballincollig GAA site as the best option. My Department will be liaising urgently with the local authority on alternative options. My Department will endeavour to make the appropriate and necessary interim accommodation arrangements in the shortest timeframe possible and will keep the school and its patron informed as viable options are examined and arrangements for September 2022 are made. My Department has been in contact with the school regarding its first year enrolment for 2022. The school's admissions policy, as published on its website, confirms that 72 places are available. My Department understands that the school made offers to applicants on 11 November and that the closing date for acceptance of these offers is 7 December. My Department will continue to work with the school and its patron in exploring the accommodation options for mainstream and special education needs pupils for the 2022-23 school year. Officials in my Department continue to liaise with officials in Cork City Council on the identification and acquisition of a suitable permanent site for the school in question. A number of permanent site options were identified. Each of these was investigated by the Department in conjunction with officials from Cork City Council. Unfortunately, in the case of all options identified, either the land could not be readily acquired from the landowner or the site was ultimately considered unfeasible for development. There has been consistent engagement and liaising with the local authority on identifying an appropriate and suitable site, and this will remain ongoing. A potential suitable site has been identified in conjunction with the city council and discussions are ongoing in terms of exploring all options available to the Department to obtain possession of it. The Department is unable to provide any further information at this stage due to commercial sensitivities related to acquisition of the permanent site, but this is a priority for the Department. I acknowledge the need within the area. We have taken a proactive approach. We have engaged from a pre-planning point of view and in respect of a variety of other sites that had potential, each of which was evaluated in conjunction with the local authority. I acknowledge the liaising with the local authority, which has been most helpful. As we proceed, we need that liaising to continue. I assure the Deputy that we will do everything possible to prioritise the acquisition of a site and move matters forward in a timely and appropriate manner so as to meet the needs of the school and the area.	spk_21

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_5	I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House, as he has requested, the current position regarding Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in schools. Ensuring that schools can continue to operate through Covid-19 has been a key priority for the Government. The Department always has been guided by our public health authorities, such as NPHET, the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, regarding the appropriate Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in place in schools. Additional funding and staff have been made available to schools to support the implementation of these measures. Furthermore, I would like to record again that I am deeply appreciative of the strong work that has taken place and continues to take place on the ground in schools around the country to implement these public health measures. As the Deputy will be aware, there have been a number of additional measures recommended by public health recently. First, the Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with the Department of Education, recently commenced a programme in which antigen tests are made available to children in primary schools when a case of Covid-19 arises. The Deputy will be aware that there were varying views at various times in regard to the effectiveness of antigen testing, but it is now the strong recommendation of the CMO that there is a place for antigen testing as an additional tool to augment all of the other tools that are in our schools. For that reason, as public health have recommended it, it is now going forward.Information materials for parents were shared with schools last week and publicised directly to parents. It has been referenced that, following recent advice from NPHET, the Government has approved the wearing of face masks by children aged nine years and older in a number of settings, including for children in third class and above in primary schools. Guidance has issued to primary schools on this basis, setting out the recommendation and the exemptions which apply in respect of children with medical or special needs. Of course, it may be difficult for some students with special needs or certain medical issues to wear face coverings. Schools know their children and are best placed to identify those children whose complex needs are such that the wearing of face coverings may not be possible for them and to discuss this with parents as required. Schools have been provided with guidance and information for parents and children. It is expected that schools, as usual, will take a practical approach over the next day or two, as has been communicated, in order to communicate the new measures to parents and ensure parents have the opportunity to provide masks to children. The measure is being introduced on a temporary basis and is subject to review in mid-February 2022. The Deputy will appreciate that this is a public health measure. It is guided by public health. It is the strong recommendation of the CMO and NPHET that this is an additional tool for our schools. The decision was taken yesterday but schools have been given the latitude over the coming days to engage with parents and students on the wearing of face masks. I confirm that this well-being approach is typical of the approach we have taken since the reopening of schools. It is a public health measure in the best interests of children, as advised by public health for the protection of children, individually and collectively, and the school community.	spk_7
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_5	I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House these measures. I reiterate that if there are outbreaks of concern in educational facilities, public health teams continue to provide support to schools where required and the measures we have implemented in schools are on the back of expert public health advice. The on-the-ground experience of public health doctors has been and remains that schools are relatively low-risk environments in terms of transmission and have not been a driver of transmission in children over the course of the pandemic. That has been reiterated by our CMO and NPHET on an ongoing basis.	spk_9
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_5	The Government is committed to supporting schools and keeping them open for all children as we continue to live with Covid-19. The aim of all the Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in place in schools is to support schools to operate safely and prevent the introduction and onward transmission of Covid-19 among the school community. I will speak specifically on the measures confirmed by the Government yesterday and the guidelines issued to schools. It is important because I have heard from the Deputy and others about the necessity to get the guidelines in place as a matter of urgency. Guidelines are required-----	spk_11
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_5	We did that yesterday and are very clear in the guidelines. I know schools and have spent the vast majority of my working life in schools.	spk_13

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_5	In relation to there being an opportunity for schools to take a flexible approach, as they always do, they have that flexibility in the coming days. The vast majority of parents are aware, as I am, that many children wore masks on the word of the CMO last week. We are taking an approach advised by public health. The measure is regarded as an additional tool for the benefit of our schools and we are implementing it. We ask parents to co-operate as they have done magnificently up to this point. I have no doubt they will do so going forward. It is operating seamlessly at second level. This is a mirror reflection of a measure regarded by public health as a public health measure. On resources going into schools, about which the Deputy made an inference, over €700 million has been expended on resources being made available to schools for a variety of infection prevention and control measures. Ventilation is considered on a case-by-case basis, as the Deputy will appreciate, because no two schools have the same requirements. It is the strong advice that natural ventilation is best but where there are specific issues, the Department has engaged on a case-by-case basis with schools, whether it is for increased vents, windows or whatever. Moneys have been paid, work has been done and if HEPA filters are required, that is also a measure.	spk_19
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-12-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_6	I acknowledge the Deputy's ongoing commitment to this issue in his constituency. It is an issue on which Deputy Aindrias Moynihan has also engaged with me. I thank Deputy Creed for raising the matter, as it allows me to provide an update to the House on the current position on the provision of interim accommodation for Le Chéile Secondary School in Ballincollig, County Cork. In September 2021, the school opened in contingency interim accommodation in the former Cork Film Centre in Ballincollig. The school will operate in interim accommodation pending delivery of its permanent school project. As the Deputy outlined, the Department of Education had sought planning permission from Cork City Council for the planned interim accommodation for the school on the grounds of Ballincollig GAA Club. That planning application has been refused by Cork City Council. At the moment, my Department is exploring what other options may be available, but it is proving difficult. Having done this previously, my Department had identified the Ballincollig GAA site as the best option. My Department will be liaising urgently with the local authority on alternative options. My Department will endeavour to make the appropriate and necessary interim accommodation arrangements in the shortest timeframe possible and will keep the school and its patron informed as viable options are examined and arrangements for September 2022 are made. My Department has been in contact with the school regarding its first year enrolment for 2022. The school's admissions policy, as published on its website, confirms that 72 places are available. My Department understands that the school made offers to applicants on 11 November and that the closing date for acceptance of these offers is 7 December. My Department will continue to work with the school and its patron in exploring the accommodation options for mainstream and special education needs pupils for the 2022-23 school year. Officials in my Department continue to liaise with officials in Cork City Council on the identification and acquisition of a suitable permanent site for the school in question. A number of permanent site options were identified. Each of these was investigated by the Department in conjunction with officials from Cork City Council. Unfortunately, in the case of all options identified, either the land could not be readily acquired from the landowner or the site was ultimately considered unfeasible for development. There has been consistent engagement and liaising with the local authority on identifying an appropriate and suitable site, and this will remain ongoing. A potential suitable site has been identified in conjunction with the city council and discussions are ongoing in terms of exploring all options available to the Department to obtain possession of it. The Department is unable to provide any further information at this stage due to commercial sensitivities related to acquisition of the permanent site, but this is a priority for the Department. I acknowledge the need within the area. We have taken a proactive approach. We have engaged from a pre-planning point of view and in respect of a variety of other sites that had potential, each of which was evaluated in conjunction with the local authority. I acknowledge the liaising with the local authority, which has been most helpful. As we proceed, we need that liaising to continue.

I thank Deputy Gannon for raising this crucial issue, which I agree must be addressed. The Government is not opposing this Private Member's Bill, although I have proposed an amendment to allow time for work under way by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to be advanced. The amendment will have the effect of the Bill being read a Second Time nine months from today. This will allow the NCCA further time for its development work. I will set out some background on the work undertaken by the NCCA and the Government’s response to the Bill. Access to relationships and sexuality education is an essential right for students and young people. Every student has a right to access information about sexual health, relationships and sexuality and this must be supported through our education system. Social, personal and health education SPHE, which includes RSE, is mandatory in all primary schools and the junior cycle. RSE is required at all levels, from primary school to senior cycle. The Department of Education has set out the content of each of the programmes in the SPHE and RSE syllabuses and guidelines.  Department of Education Circular 27/2010 requires that schools have a policy for RSE developed in consultation with teachers, parents and guardians, members of boards of management and students. The schools must teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including but not limited to family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. The circular provides that all aspects of the programme can and should be taught within the ethos and value system of the school as expressed in the school RSE policy. It should be emphasised, however, that elements of the programme cannot be omitted on the grounds of school ethos. I believe all of us are cognisant of the change that has occurred since the present RSE curriculum was developed. It is crucial our young people be taught material that is current, up to date and reflective of their lived experiences in a modern world. As we know, the Internet and social media have considerably changed the context in which education operates and, of course, considerable developments have occurred in respect of attitudes to sexuality more broadly and issues such as sexual orientation, contraception and consent. We must ensure the curriculum provides information in a manner that is factual and appropriate to a student’s age and stage of development.  As such, in 2018, the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, requested the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to undertake a major review of RSE in schools at all stages of education to ensure it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland. The request to the NCCA included a number of areas for inclusion in the review, namely, how the RSE curriculum is planned, how it is taught and how parents are involved; that the entire curriculum is taught in schools to a high standard; the role of the classroom teacher in teaching the curriculum and the appropriate level of supports provided by external providers; how much time is given to it, what resources are provided and what support materials are used; and how effective the continuing professional development opportunities provided by the Department and other bodies to RSE teachers are. The review was asked also to consider a number of curriculum areas, namely, consent, what it means and its importance; developments in contraception; healthy, positive sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet; social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters. The Department of Education and the NCCA continue to advance that work. The report on the review of relationships and sexuality education in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA in December 2019. On foot of the recommendations within the report, the NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the development of an updated curriculum and materials in this area and supporting the development of guidance material for schools. Both the primary and post-primary SPHE-RSE development groups have been meeting online monthly since the groups were convened in October 2020. The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an interim guidance toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE and RSE linked to the current curriculum. This work is progressing well and extensive supports have been published as part of these toolkits, which can be accessed at  In tandem with providing these immediate supports for teachers, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum is well under way, with an initial focus on the junior cycle. Following a review of the current junior cycle SPHE short course, a brief for the redevelopment of junior cycle SPHE was developed. Together with a background paper, this brief was published on the NCCA website and consulted on from late September to early November this year. Feedback from this consultation is being analysed and will be reported on in early 2022. Consultation feedback will inform the work of the post-primary development group in updating the specification for junior cycle SPHE. Importantly, consultation will also take place in 2022 on the draft updated specification during which students, teachers, parents and wider civil society can provide their views. Drawing on this feedback, the updated specification will be finalised by the end of 2022. It is planned the new specification will be rolled out to all schools from September 2023. The redevelopment of the junior cycle SPHE and RSE curriculum materials will be followed by the redevelopment of the senior cycle and primary curriculums. Resources to equip teachers with the skills, competence and confidence to teach the curriculum effectively will also be developed. In updating the curriculums, particular attention is being given to the inclusion of learning in topics including but limited to: healthy, positive sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media; consent; pornography; gender and sexual discrimination; developments in contraception; and LGBTQ+ matters. In addition, inter-agency meetings are taking place to discuss how teachers’ professional development needs can be met in this area and how teachers can be supported and upskilled to enable the successful implementation of an updated curriculum. Work is well under way in developing an integrated, updated SPHE-RSE curriculum for both primary and post-primary that is grounded in the rights of all children and young people to learning that is inclusive and both age and developmentally appropriate, aimed at enabling them to create and maintain healthy, respectful relationships and lead fulfilling and healthy lives. The work is grounded in research and international good practice as well as significant consultations that have taken place with teachers, parents, students and other education partners in recent times.This evidence-informed, collaborative and consultative approach is important in progressing this vitally important and sensitive area of curriculum development. It is vital that students have access to factual, evidence-informed, scientific and objective information. Where legislation is needed to support the right approach, then we must ensure this happens. This is reflected in the programme for Government, which states that this Government will ""Develop inclusive and age-appropriate RSE and SPHE curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships and making appropriate legislative changes, if necessary."" For these reasons, I very much welcome Deputy Gannon’s initiative in raising this critical issue in this House. It is important that the need for legislation, the form it takes and its content should be informed by the development work that is currently being advanced."	spk_27

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	Ensuring schools can operate safely has been a key priority for me as Minister for Education. My Department has always been guided by public health advice on appropriate Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in our schools. These measures protect students, their parents and school staff and are effective. Public health advice is that the two most important actions to prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses are ensuring no one with new onset symptoms attends school and all recommended infection prevention and control measures are in place in line with school Covid response plans. Each school was provided with an updated Covid-19 response plan in advance of the return to school. Significant additional resources of €639 million were put into schools in the previous academic year to keep schools safe. Further funding of €57.6 million has been paid by way of Covid-19 capitation to schools in September for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures for this term alone. This funding will cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures, personal protective equipment, PPE, requirements, enhanced cleaning supports and supervision. At primary level, additional management resources for principal release days were provided for principals and deputy principals. Teacher supply panels were also expanded to cover the majority of primary schools nationwide, and a recent review saw an additional 100 teaching posts added, resulting in approximately 480 teaching posts on these panels available to provide substitute cover in schools At post-primary level, more than 1,000 teaching posts were provided to support social distancing within classrooms, to provide for enhanced supervision arrangements to manage and prevent congregation of large groups of students, and to ensure the careful movement in a socially distant manner to classes for specialist subjects where it is neither practical nor possible to remain in the classroom. This funding also included additional posts for guidance provision. Managing ventilation is also an important part of the measures to keep our schools safe. Updated guidance for schools on practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices in schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing Covid-19. The Department's guidance is clear that where the recommended measures have been undertaken and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with the other methods of ventilation that are available.	spk_254
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	At the outset I want to be very clear that we have followed public health advice and guidance in our schools. It is the expert view of public health officials that our schools are places of low transmission, largely because of the very significant and substantial infection prevention and control measures that are in place in schools. Specifically on the points made by the Deputy on CO2 monitors, these were suggested and are available in our schools. Equally, in terms of ventilation we have been very clear at every point that if there are issues with ventilation, they can and will be addressed. Public health officials have been very clear in telling us that natural ventilation is the most important type of ventilation, but where there are specific issues with a vent or a window or more substantial issues, we have a technical team available to schools. Schools can apply for emergency works funding, which they have done and they have been supported in doing so. All measures that are required in terms of ventilation are being put in place in schools, whatever those measures might be.	spk_256
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	Again, to reiterate, at the risk of repeating myself, we follow best practice public health advice in our schools. Indeed, that is what we have done in wider society also. The Deputy is aware it is the expert judgment of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, that there is now a role for antigen testing in our schools and the HSE has been charged with the responsibility of rolling that out. The Deputy will be aware that if a child tests positive, parents are being asked to inform the principal. In turn, the principal is being asked to inform the parents of the children in that child's pod, without giving away any personal details. If there are more than two outbreaks in a classroom within a seven-day period, apart from the original pod, antigen testing will be made available to the entire class. In that instance, accommodation will be made for staff members related to the pod or the class. In terms of the mechanism of receiving tests in the post, the Deputy will be aware this is the current situation regarding wider society. There is no question of principals or anyone else in the school sector being asked to do contact tracing. Public health teams remain available to schools where the need arises.	spk_258
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	I appreciate the question and the sincerity with which it is put. The Deputy may be aware that, between 2016 and 2020, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, undertook an extensive review of senior cycle programmes and vocational pathways. The NCCA’s advisory report on the senior cycle has been submitted to my Department for consideration and will be published once that consideration is complete. I am aware of the desire in the education community and more generally for that to happen, but we must complete our consideration of the report. I am focusing on what the implementation of the report would involve and what we can do to best ensure the further evolution of the senior cycle. As the consideration of the advisory report has continued, my officials have had contact with officials in the NCCA and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, to ensure there is a clarity of understanding on some matters identified in the report. I have had a considerable number of briefing sessions and meetings with relevant officials in my Department as our consideration of the NCCA advisory report has continued.In addition, I recently attended an NCCA meeting to thank the council and acknowledge its work in developing the advisory report. I also opened the recent Joint Managerial Body conference, the theme of which was A Senior Cycle for All. In respect of the advisory report, the review considered a number of areas, including the question of the overall purpose of senior cycle education, as the Deputy referenced, how to establish continuity and progression, and the pathways available to students. The review involved a broad range of research, consultations, and communications with a broad range of stakeholders, including very importantly, students themselves, on all aspects of review and redevelopment. The NCCA also commissioned external expertise, which is also important, to support the process, including the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the OECD.	spk_260
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	I appreciate the point the Deputy made. Covid has focused our lens even more closely on how the leaving certificate and senior cycle operates. To be fair, the entire review involves all of the senior cycle, and, therefore, includes the leaving certificate applied, the leaving certificate established and the leaving certificate vocational programme. We are also referring to the transition year programme as well. I agree that when we are looking at the senior cycle, we must look at it in its entirety. I acknowledge that within the report there has been an opportunity to consider what we have currently and what works well, but also to go beyond that and to consider the key question, which is if there is a pathway for all within education where every child's needs are met within the education system and there is an opportunity for everybody to progress to whatever level or to take whatever pathway they might wish to follow. I am especially pleased that the review has consulted widely and that students have been at the centre of it, and also that there is outside expertise. There is an urgency attached to moving ahead with senior cycle reform. I confirm that I am conscious of that and cognisant of it.	spk_262
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	I appreciate the points the Deputy has made and the urgency with which he views the question. The review was four years in the making and involves a considerable body of work. There was the widest consultation, rightly, with all the partners in education – parents, teachers, wider society, obviously students as well, and also the views and experiences of experts from other jurisdictions. Therefore, it demands a level of consideration that is important. As I previously outlined to the Deputy, it has involved further engagement with the NCCA on points of clarification. It has also involved work with the secondary education committee, SEC. I appreciate the urgency attached to the review. I assure him that it will be published in the shortest timeframe. I am confident that it will set a pathway forward.	spk_264
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	I am the first to acknowledge that these have been difficult and challenging times, not just currently but throughout the pandemic, for all school leaders and all school communities. There has been an extraordinary generosity by school leaders and school communities to do what needs to be done in the delivery of education and to pivot in other directions when it was not possible to maintain the delivery in the school setting and to provide remote teaching and learning. I accept there are continuing challenges in the education sector. The Deputy referred in particular to substitution. I acknowledge that there has been extraordinary co-operation between the partners in education and others in finding a pathway forward. It is a considerable challenge, and it is more acute in some areas than others. Significant measures have been put in place in recent weeks, and again this evening. Following positive engagement with the higher education institutions, HEIs, in recent weeks, including today, we are now in a position to say that there will be an opportunity for the HEIs to facilitate release of master’s in primary education, and BEd years 3 and 4 students to support schools up to the end of term. The HEIs have also agreed to explore flexible options on the assessment requirements for programmes in the context of students being available to support schools also, which is an important consideration. Retired teachers returning to the classroom until the end of the current term will not have their pensions impacted. Qualified teachers on secondment to the Department's teacher education support services will now be released and made available to schools. The continuing professional development, CPD, programmes, which are being followed at primary school, where substitution is required will be deferred until the mid-term break in February. It is intended that the programmes will be rescheduled following the mid-term break. There will also be additionality added to the supply panels. A total of 100 teachers were added in the past week or so and a further 200 will be added bringing us to 680 teachers available on a full-time basis. There are also other measures.	spk_266
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	I want to be very clear. No single measure is sufficient of itself to meet the challenges that are particularly acute in some areas. I have referenced the fact that those who are on secondment, in particular those who are on secondment to the professional development service for teachers, PDST, will be released and made available.That is an important measure. It is important to say also that a number of measures have been announced in the last while and these are additional measures that are being announced today. The Deputy referenced the substitution panel, which I also referenced. We now have full-time opportunities for teachers to make themselves available for emergency cover in schools. These panels have been expanded. Prior to this Government being formed, there were six of those panels in the country and there are now more than 400 of them, and we continue to keep that under review and to provide additionality, with more than 680 teachers being made available as well. There are also other measures in terms of teachers on supply panels completing Droichead in order to assist with the recruitment of teachers and, in the context of the pandemic, the Teaching Council has confirmed that teachers who secure posts on supply panels will also be eligible to complete Droichead.	spk_268
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	To clarify with regard to substitution, a whole myriad of measures are being made available to schools, not one single measure. In terms of special education specifically, it is very important that children who need to avail of particular supports because they have particular special educational challenges should receive that support at the time they are scheduled to receive it. I do not think it is helpful to pit one group of students against another. It is important that, as the need arises and as the students are timetabled for special educational support, they should receive it at that time. On contact tracing, I want to be very clear. The Deputy referred to public health, which continues to be available to schools currently and in the future in terms of any particular issues that might arise in schools. I have outlined previously what the new mechanisms will be, bearing in mind that this is the expert recommendation of the CMO and of public health, which have supported the running of our schools right from the very beginning and the onset of this pandemic.	spk_270
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	"I appreciate the question. The approach to supporting schools to operate safely during Covid-19 has been to follow and implement public health advice. A range of measures have been implemented across schools, including social distancing, enhanced cleaning and, as the Deputy will be aware, mask wearing in some settings for students and in all settings for staff. As of 27 September 2021, following a recommendation from NPHET, a decision was taken to cease routine contact tracing of asymptomatic close contacts in children older than three months to under 13 years outside the household setting, including those attending primary educational and childcare settings. Contact tracing continues for those over 13 years, including those attending post-primary schools. Schools are still required to undertake the two most important actions to prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses by ensuring no one with new acute symptoms attends class and that all recommended infection prevention and control measures are in place in line with school Covid response plans. The Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with the Department of Education, announced last week a programme in which antigen tests will be made available to children in primary schools when a case of Covid-19 arises. Parents and guardians of a primary school child who is a confirmed case of Covid-19 following a PCR test are asked to inform their school principal. The school principal will then inform the parents of other children in the pod of a confirmed case. Where there are two cases in a class in more than one pod in a seven- day period, antigen tests will be offered to every child in the class. Of course, no personal details of the child will be shared. These parents will be provided with the option to receive free antigen tests for their child, which they will be able to order for delivery to their home. It is important that parents inform principals quickly if a child receives a PCR ""detected"" test for Covid-19. By doing this, the choice to participate in antigen testing can be offered to other parents quickly. It is important that everyone continues to follow all the public health advice in using this new programme. It is not mandatory for children to participate in antigen testing. Children who are in a pod where a child has tested positive for Covid-19 can continue to attend school whether they participate in antigen testing or not."	spk_272
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	I thank the Deputy. Again, I appreciate the very positive approach he takes and the generosity with which he shares his experience. In terms of our schools as they exist, comparable to other schools, there are very significant infection prevention and control measures in our schools, and I would venture to say they are not comparable to the lack of them in other jurisdictions. On antigen testing, the Deputy will appreciate there have been very differing views on antigen tests, their utility and their effectiveness, and all of that. As new evidence becomes available, as we have found throughout Covid, the implementation of measures and the recommendations are altered. We now have the expert view of the CMO who, having reviewed the evidence, believes there is a role for antigen testing in our schools, but he is very clear to say it is merely an additional tool and it will be seen and implemented in that respect. All of the other infection prevention and control measures will continue in schools to support the operation of our schools.	spk_274
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	I thank the Deputy. In terms of antigen testing, obviously, it is a public health measure and it is being led by the HSE, but there is a significant body of work under way whereby guidelines will now be made available to school principals, school staff and parents, and that will all be communicated in advance of Monday, 29 November. How correctly to utilise and use antigen testing will also form part of that communication, which is very important. Particular significance has been given to that by all of the public health officials so that we would know exactly how best to use and utilise them within the schools. I want to be clear that, as I said previously, all of the measures that are recommended to us by public health have been made available to our schools and we have resourced them. This is an additional tool. We will continue to listen and to work with public health and any further recommendations or requirements that are necessary, we will also implement.	spk_276
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	I appreciate the Deputy raising this issue and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, has raised it with me on an ongoing basis as well. I recognise the considerable challenge experienced by all of those impacted by mica. I have met families and representative groups to discuss the issue and I want to confirm that my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, is engaging extensively with homeowners, as the Deputy will be aware, to develop an appropriate redress package for all those affected. I am conscious of the submission from Donegal ETB seeking supports to assist those affected. My Department has a comprehensive range of supports in place to support the well-being and mental health of all students. These supports should be prioritised and utilised by the ETB to help address any mental health and well-being needs of those students who are affected by this issue. These supports include casework by psychologists from my Department’s National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. Psychologists also work with school staff to build their capability to support the well-being and academic, social and emotional development of all pupils. Resources and guidance on managing stress, anxiety and panic attacks and on self-regulation are also available. NEPS has developed a range of workshops to build the capability of school staff in the promotion of well-being and resilience in schools, which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically informed approaches in schools. The Department of Health has responsibility for the provision of counselling services, and through HSE primary care psychology and child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, provides clinical support to children and young people with mental health requirements. My Department will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE-funded mental health services. Significant additional resources have been made available to schools this year under the Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS, which has provided additional teaching hours to schools to support academic teaching and learning as well as holistic development and well-being. Overall, 3,930 hours have been allocated to Donegal ETB for the 2021 and 2022 school year in the CLASS.	spk_278
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	I want to make it clear that I do not for one minute underestimate the personal difficulties of any family, individual, young person or child experiencing mica defects in their homes. As I have outlined, there are specific and strong supports available within our school system. Equally, additional measures have been put in place this year. For example, for the first time almost 4,000 hours are going to Donegal ETB under the CLASS, which is for academic and holistic supports that students would require at this time, even apart from mica. However, I am happy to say that I will be cognisant of the points the Deputy and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, have raised with me. I will be happy for my officials in the Department to meet Donegal ETB to see what scope or opportunity there might be to address some of the points it wishes to raise.	spk_280
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_17	I do not in any way take from the seriousness of the situation. There has been a request for counselling services and that is a matter for the Department of Health. It has responsibility for the provision of counselling services, and through the HSE it provides primary care psychology and CAMHS services to children and young people with mental health needs. On the additional supports that might help, I am open to officials in my Department meeting Donegal ETB, recognising that there is a body of measures in place. I am open and willing to have my officials meet Donegal ETB to specifically hear from it about the measures it wishes to bring to the attention of the Department.	spk_282
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_18	Ensuring schools can operate safely has been a key priority for me as Minister for Education. My Department has always been guided by public health advice on appropriate Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in our schools. These measures protect students, their parents and school staff and are effective. Public health advice is that the two most important actions to prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses are ensuring no one with new onset symptoms attends school and all recommended infection prevention and control measures are in place in line with school Covid response plans. Each school was provided with an updated Covid-19 response plan in advance of the return to school. Significant additional resources of €639 million were put into schools in the previous academic year to keep schools safe. Further funding of €57.6 million has been paid by way of Covid-19 capitation to schools in September for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures for this term alone. This funding will cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures, personal protective equipment, PPE, requirements, enhanced cleaning supports and supervision. At primary level, additional management resources for principal release days were provided for principals and deputy principals. Teacher supply panels were also expanded to cover the majority of primary schools nationwide, and a recent review saw an additional 100 teaching posts added, resulting in approximately 480 teaching posts on these panels available to provide substitute cover in schools At post-primary level, more than 1,000 teaching posts were provided to support social distancing within classrooms, to provide for enhanced supervision arrangements to manage and prevent congregation of large groups of students, and to ensure the careful movement in a socially distant manner to classes for specialist subjects where it is neither practical nor possible to remain in the classroom. This funding also included additional posts for guidance provision. Managing ventilation is also an important part of the measures to keep our schools safe. Updated guidance for schools on practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices in schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing Covid-19. The Department's guidance is clear that where the recommended measures have been undertaken and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with the other methods of ventilation that are available.	spk_254
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_18	At the outset I want to be very clear that we have followed public health advice and guidance in our schools. It is the expert view of public health officials that our schools are places of low transmission, largely because of the very significant and substantial infection prevention and control measures that are in place in schools. Specifically on the points made by the Deputy on CO2 monitors, these were suggested and are available in our schools. Equally, in terms of ventilation we have been very clear at every point that if there are issues with ventilation, they can and will be addressed. Public health officials have been very clear in telling us that natural ventilation is the most important type of ventilation, but where there are specific issues with a vent or a window or more substantial issues, we have a technical team available to schools. Schools can apply for emergency works funding, which they have done and they have been supported in doing so. All measures that are required in terms of ventilation are being put in place in schools, whatever those measures might be.	spk_256
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_18	Again, to reiterate, at the risk of repeating myself, we follow best practice public health advice in our schools. Indeed, that is what we have done in wider society also. The Deputy is aware it is the expert judgment of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, that there is now a role for antigen testing in our schools and the HSE has been charged with the responsibility of rolling that out. The Deputy will be aware that if a child tests positive, parents are being asked to inform the principal. In turn, the principal is being asked to inform the parents of the children in that child's pod, without giving away any personal details. If there are more than two outbreaks in a classroom within a seven-day period, apart from the original pod, antigen testing will be made available to the entire class. In that instance, accommodation will be made for staff members related to the pod or the class. In terms of the mechanism of receiving tests in the post, the Deputy will be aware this is the current situation regarding wider society. There is no question of principals or anyone else in the school sector being asked to do contact tracing. Public health teams remain available to schools where the need arises.	spk_258
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Educational Reform	dbsect_19	I appreciate the question and the sincerity with which it is put. The Deputy may be aware that, between 2016 and 2020, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, undertook an extensive review of senior cycle programmes and vocational pathways. The NCCA’s advisory report on the senior cycle has been submitted to my Department for consideration and will be published once that consideration is complete. I am aware of the desire in the education community and more generally for that to happen, but we must complete our consideration of the report. I am focusing on what the implementation of the report would involve and what we can do to best ensure the further evolution of the senior cycle. As the consideration of the advisory report has continued, my officials have had contact with officials in the NCCA and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, to ensure there is a clarity of understanding on some matters identified in the report. I have had a considerable number of briefing sessions and meetings with relevant officials in my Department as our consideration of the NCCA advisory report has continued.In addition, I recently attended an NCCA meeting to thank the council and acknowledge its work in developing the advisory report. I also opened the recent Joint Managerial Body conference, the theme of which was A Senior Cycle for All. In respect of the advisory report, the review considered a number of areas, including the question of the overall purpose of senior cycle education, as the Deputy referenced, how to establish continuity and progression, and the pathways available to students. The review involved a broad range of research, consultations, and communications with a broad range of stakeholders, including very importantly, students themselves, on all aspects of review and redevelopment. The NCCA also commissioned external expertise, which is also important, to support the process, including the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the OECD.	spk_260
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Educational Reform	dbsect_19	I appreciate the point the Deputy made. Covid has focused our lens even more closely on how the leaving certificate and senior cycle operates. To be fair, the entire review involves all of the senior cycle, and, therefore, includes the leaving certificate applied, the leaving certificate established and the leaving certificate vocational programme. We are also referring to the transition year programme as well. I agree that when we are looking at the senior cycle, we must look at it in its entirety. I acknowledge that within the report there has been an opportunity to consider what we have currently and what works well, but also to go beyond that and to consider the key question, which is if there is a pathway for all within education where every child's needs are met within the education system and there is an opportunity for everybody to progress to whatever level or to take whatever pathway they might wish to follow. I am especially pleased that the review has consulted widely and that students have been at the centre of it, and also that there is outside expertise. There is an urgency attached to moving ahead with senior cycle reform. I confirm that I am conscious of that and cognisant of it.	spk_262
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Educational Reform	dbsect_19	I appreciate the points the Deputy has made and the urgency with which he views the question. The review was four years in the making and involves a considerable body of work. There was the widest consultation, rightly, with all the partners in education – parents, teachers, wider society, obviously students as well, and also the views and experiences of experts from other jurisdictions. Therefore, it demands a level of consideration that is important. As I previously outlined to the Deputy, it has involved further engagement with the NCCA on points of clarification. It has also involved work with the secondary education committee, SEC. I appreciate the urgency attached to the review. I assure him that it will be published in the shortest timeframe. I am confident that it will set a pathway forward.	spk_264
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_20	I am the first to acknowledge that these have been difficult and challenging times, not just currently but throughout the pandemic, for all school leaders and all school communities. There has been an extraordinary generosity by school leaders and school communities to do what needs to be done in the delivery of education and to pivot in other directions when it was not possible to maintain the delivery in the school setting and to provide remote teaching and learning. I accept there are continuing challenges in the education sector. The Deputy referred in particular to substitution. I acknowledge that there has been extraordinary co-operation between the partners in education and others in finding a pathway forward. It is a considerable challenge, and it is more acute in some areas than others. Significant measures have been put in place in recent weeks, and again this evening. Following positive engagement with the higher education institutions, HEIs, in recent weeks, including today, we are now in a position to say that there will be an opportunity for the HEIs to facilitate release of master’s in primary education, and BEd years 3 and 4 students to support schools up to the end of term. The HEIs have also agreed to explore flexible options on the assessment requirements for programmes in the context of students being available to support schools also, which is an important consideration. Retired teachers returning to the classroom until the end of the current term will not have their pensions impacted. Qualified teachers on secondment to the Department's teacher education support services will now be released and made available to schools. The continuing professional development, CPD, programmes, which are being followed at primary school, where substitution is required will be deferred until the mid-term break in February. It is intended that the programmes will be rescheduled following the mid-term break. There will also be additionality added to the supply panels. A total of 100 teachers were added in the past week or so and a further 200 will be added bringing us to 680 teachers available on a full-time basis. There are also other measures.	spk_266
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_20	I want to be very clear. No single measure is sufficient of itself to meet the challenges that are particularly acute in some areas. I have referenced the fact that those who are on secondment, in particular those who are on secondment to the professional development service for teachers, PDST, will be released and made available.That is an important measure. It is important to say also that a number of measures have been announced in the last while and these are additional measures that are being announced today. The Deputy referenced the substitution panel, which I also referenced. We now have full-time opportunities for teachers to make themselves available for emergency cover in schools. These panels have been expanded. Prior to this Government being formed, there were six of those panels in the country and there are now more than 400 of them, and we continue to keep that under review and to provide additionality, with more than 680 teachers being made available as well.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	As the Deputy may be aware, the NCCA carried out a review of the senior cycle between 2016 and 2020, leading to the advisory report the Deputy has referenced. The review covered a number of areas, including the question of the overall identity and purposes of senior cycle education; how to establish continuity and progression with the new junior cycle; and the range of learning programmes and pathways available to students at senior cycle. In addition to this, the review considers: how best to improve flexibility and choice for students; the alignment of key skills with the needs of students; and the appropriate arrangements for assessment and certification in senior cycle. The NCCA review involved a broad range of research, consultations and communications with a wide variety of stakeholders, including students, on all aspects of review and redevelopment over a number of phases over the period of the review. In particular, the second phase, which took place over 2018 and 2019, involved a school review and national seminar series. Teachers, students and parents in a representative cross-section of schools nationwide took part in a review of the existing senior cycle. Review feedback was then analysed and emerging themes and areas for further exploration were identified. The third phase of the review also invited individuals and organisations, including students and student representative organisations, to participate in a public consultation process, leading to the publication of a public consultation report in December 2019. This consultation included 4,300 responses to an online consultation survey, as well as focus groups, meetings and the receipt by the NCCA of written submissions.The NCCA also commissioned external expertise to support the process, including the ESRI and the OECD. As I have mentioned, the NCCA submitted its advisory report to my Department. My officials and I have been considering the report carefully, with a view to delivering a senior cycle programme that meets the needs of the students of today and the future.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	It is important to point out that all learnings from Covid are important, not only within the education sector but in all of society. Specifically, in relation to the questions the Deputies raise here in terms of senior cycle, all of what we have learned through Covid is an important consideration. All of what we have learned and experienced prior to Covid also will inform this report. Deputy O'Donnell quite correctly referred to the leaving certificate, as we are focused on the leaving certificate, as being a very significant examination. It is a very significant examination and it holds a considerable status within this country. Equally, wider society is clearly of a view - I am absolutely committed to this - that there is a need now to do a complete review of the leaving certificate in its entirety. The Deputies referenced methods and means pertaining to assessment and certification. I absolutely acknowledge that. I also acknowledge that we need to be innovative in our thinking in terms of the pathways we offer people and that there should be every possible opportunity for students to progress from junior cycle straight into senior cycle and then onwards to whatever pathway that they might wish to pursue. I want to be clear to the Deputies that I am entirely committed to the senior cycle review providing opportunities in terms of senior cycle education for all where every young person's ability and every young person's potential and capability is maximised, and that is the objective here.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	I thank Deputy Ward for his question. I wish to advise the Deputy that the Department is aware of increasing local pressures and demand for additional post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas, including the mid-west Dublin area. However, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by a number of different factors, as the Deputy will be aware. In some instances, it could be duplication of applications where pupils may apply for a place to a number of schools in the area; pupils cannot get a place in their preferred school or school of choice while there are places in other schools in the area; some towns or areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school, they are not available to all pupils; and there is the external draw, with pupils coming from outside the local area. I reference these as sometimes causing specific issues. The Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in Dublin Mid-West, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train. Under Project Ireland 2040, the Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands. It is expected that the enrolment pressures in this area and others will reduce in the short term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. The capital programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the school planning areas in question, may be viewed on my Department's website. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website. The capital programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required; and for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on the website.	spk_292
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	I mentioned some of those points because they can cause specific issues at different times. Under Project Ireland 2040, €8.9 billion will be invested by the Department of Education in the school building programme. On additional school accommodation being made available in Dublin mid-west, it is intended that the following building projects will provide additional capacity in these areas: at St. Joseph's College there is a project for extension, refurbishment to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils. It is at stage 3 now. The project at Lucan Community College is for extension refurbishment to cater for a long-term projection of enrolment of 1,000 pupils and two SEN-based classrooms. It is at stage 2B. There is a project for a new school building at Griffeen Community College to provide a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils and four SEN-based classrooms. There will also be projects at Holy Family Community School and in City West and Saggart, Coláiste Pobal Fóla.	spk_294
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	There are further large-scale projects which will also provide additional school accommodation in the Dublin mid-west area, including at Moyle Park College, Clondalkin, Collinstown Park Community College, Coláiste Cois Life and the school in which, I appreciate, the Deputy has a particular interest, namely, St. Kevin's Community College. St. Kevin's was provided with additional general classroom, specialist subject and ancillary accommodation under the Department's 2021 modular framework to meet additional needs in the current academic year. All the issues raised by the Deputy in respect of Dublin mid-west are kept consistently under review. Where further resources are needed, we will not be found wanting.	spk_296
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	I wish to confirm to the Deputy that the majority of schools have a general purpose room or physical education hall and practically all schools have outdoor play areas. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools. Investment and expenditure on PE halls is an element of the overall expenditure and investment in the school building programme. The provision of PE halls and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts form part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school. The Department provides general purpose rooms and PE halls with the construction of all new primary and post-primary schools, respectively. These facilities may also be provided where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school. In addition, the Department’s design guidelines for all new schools provide for outdoor multi-use games areas, in other words, hard play areas, and the level of play space provided varies with the size of the school. For example, a new 24-classroom primary school with special educational needs classes is provided with three ball courts, two junior play areas as well as a secure hard and soft play area and a 100 sq. m sensory garden. In respect of new post-primary schools, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school is provided with six ball courts and a 200 sq. m secure hard and soft special education play area. The main focus of resources over the past decade and, as the Deputy will appreciate, for the coming period is on the provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics, particularly at post-primary level and for special educational needs provision. The Deputy will appreciate the immediate priority of the Department is providing new and replacement school places each year to ensure every child has a school place. However, the second half of the national development plan period will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock. This will include a PE hall build and modernisation programme to ensure students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision. The ancillary accommodation needs of primary schools, such as general purpose rooms, will also be considered. Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on the Department's website. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.	spk_305
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	As I have previously outlined, the Department has a significant pipeline of projects to be delivered over the coming years to meet capacity need managed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme. This involves in excess of 1,200 school building projects across various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. The current delivery status of these projects is listed on a county by county basis on the website, as I have said to the Deputy. There are currently 377 schools, or 338 projects, listed on the large-scale capital programme, which would be expected to provide new PE halls at post-primary level where none already exist, or general purpose halls at primary level where none exist. Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately €4.4 billion in capital investment over the period of 2021 to 2025. The Deputy is correct the focus at present is on new builds and where there is a significant refurbishment of a school but equally I appreciate the importance of this area of provision. It is part of our plan going forward.	spk_307
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	I want to be very clear to the Deputy there is an absolute commitment from the Department to provide all the necessary provision and opportunities necessary within the education sector. It is true to say we have presided over the single greatest investment in education in the most recent budget. Equally, there is a breadth of vision for education with respect to the provision of new builds, senior cycle reform as discussed earlier and the provision for special educational needs referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan. There is an enormous breadth of vision for education and indeed enormous investment in education by the present Government. Specifically with new building and the refurbishment of existing buildings, there is a particular concentration at present on the provision of places for all students, but an equal emphasis is being placed on the provision of appropriate facilities and resources for students also.	spk_309
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	I thank the Deputy. I appreciate her taking the time to raise the question. Budget 2022, as the Deputy is aware, has provided for an allocation of €18 million for 2022 and €32 million for 2023 to extend the DEIS programme to further schools with the highest levels of disadvantage. This represents an increase of over 20% in funding for the DEIS programme and will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools. This year the Department will spend in the region of €150 million on providing supports for schools in the DEIS programme. The programme supports 884 schools and more than 180,000 learners. The Department's investment includes providing for in excess of 400 home school community liaison co-ordinators, in the region of €16 million in DEIS grants, additional posts for DEIS band 1 primary schools, curriculum supports, enhanced book grants, and access to the school completion programme. This year's package follows an extensive body of work that has been undertaken by the DEIS technical group on the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools.This work involved an initial process of consultation between the Department and the education partners on the technical aspects of the model. The purpose of the consultation is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application. Under DEIS plan 2017, the DEIS identification process is based on an objective statistics-based model to determine which schools merit inclusion in the programme. An extensive body of work has been undertaken by the DEIS technical group on developing the defined model. The key data sources used in the DEIS identification process are the Department of Education primary online database, the post-primary online databases and Central Statistics Office, CSO, data from the national census of population as represented in the Pobal HP deprivation index for small areas, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.	spk_311
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	I acknowledge that the Deputy is particularly invested in this issue. I would venture to say that the vast majority of Deputies are also invested in it, but she has been a particularly strong advocate for the schools she referenced and for the roll-out, enhancement and extension of the DEIS programme. She does not need to tell me - I am well aware of the importance of the DEIS programme. It is for that reason I am particularly pleased that during budget discussion and engagement I secured an additional allocation for the programme of €18 million for 2022, rising to €32 million in 2023, which will allow an extension of the programme as we go forward. It is important to note that schools are not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and that all schools will be considered under the refined model. It is also important to note that educational outcomes do not play any part in identification of schools for inclusion in the DEIS programme, either at primary or post-primary level.	spk_313
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	I appreciate the case the Deputy made. She is correct that the hot meals programme for schools does not fall within my remit but she will be aware that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, made some very positive announcements about it this week. I also acknowledge the other additional supports available to schools outside of the DEIS programme, notwithstanding its importance and the supports it provides and, as I said, the expectation that we are now looking forward to rolling it out even further. For example, I referenced previously the Covid-19 learning and support scheme, CLASS, which is a provision of up to €52 million for extra teaching hours that is being made available to all schools. This is another significant resource that is going into schools, specifically this year, to meet the challenge of Covid, not just from an academic and learning perspective but a holistic perspective, where children and young people will have opportunities to experience socialisation and all that goes with it.	spk_315
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	On 30 June 2021, I announced that adjustments would be made to the 2022 leaving certificate and junior cycle examinations. As in previous years, adjustments were developed in conjunction with the leaving certificate advisory group, which is important. This group includes representation from students, parents, teachers and schools. Details of these adjustments were issued to schools in August 2021 to ensure that students and staff could familiarise themselves with any changes. These arrangements acknowledge the disruption faced by this particular cohort of students because of the Covid-19 pandemic. I consider that these arrangements are proportionate to the students’ experience and loss of learning and are educationally appropriate. The adjustments ensure that the overall structure of exams remains intact but allows for greater choice for students. The level of adjustment will be similar to that applied by the assessment arrangements for junior cycle and leaving certificate examinations in 2021, as announced in December 2020. As part of the adjustments for the 2022 exams, I also announced that an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations will be run in 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of exams. These exams will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of exams due to close family bereavement and certain other categories of serious illness, to be determined with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, which govern all aspects of the exam system. The State Examinations Commission will issue further details regarding the 2022 examinations, guided by prevailing public health advice, which is an important consideration. There will be further engagement with stakeholders through the advisory group on planning for the State examinations, and with other stakeholders as appropriate, in advance of any detailed announcement.	spk_317
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	I acknowledge that the provision of an opportunity, in the midst of a pandemic, for students to avail of the accredited grades process and written exams was a remarkable achievement for the education sector. I acknowledge school leadership and school communities who, in a very difficult and challenging time, really pulled together to ensure that the classes of 2021 and 2020 would have an opportunity to find a pathway forward to sit a final State exam. One of the most interesting learnings from the process was the fact that there was such a high uptake for both options. There was a high uptake for the written exams, on which an element of doubt was cast originally. It was very interesting to see that students opted to maximise their potential. There are learnings from that but, equally, also from all we have known and experienced of senior cycle, in particular, prior to Covid.	spk_319
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	Clear guidance has been given to schools on how the exams will operate for 2022. This has been formulated via the advisory group, which includes parents, teachers, students and school management and, therefore, it has been the widest engagement of consultation. Those amendments and their offering of a wider choice has been communicated to schools. Students are now very familiar with that opportunity. Equally, I was clear in making the decision that a second opportunity for taking the leaving certificate exams would be made available as close as possible after the first sitting of leaving certificate. We continue to operate currently and going forward on the back of public health advice, and any contingencies that might be required as a consequence of that advice will be put in place.	spk_321
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	Having worked for many years in the classroom, I appreciate that exam time and most notably, leaving certificate exam time, can be a stressful time for students. Of course, the pandemic has added to the additional challenges faced by all in the school sector. The decisions taken by Government on leaving certificate 2021, in the context of the impact on teaching and learning of the Covid-19 pandemic, were taken with the best interests of students in mind. The NCCA's advisory report on the senior cycle review has been submitted to me for consideration and will be published once that consideration is complete. Those considerations are being progressed with the best interests of students in mind.  The advisory report maps out, in broad terms, an ambitious programme of work, which would enable the development and construction of the components that would make up a framework for senior cycle and will involve further ongoing stakeholder engagement and consultation. The voices of students have contributed to the advisory report and will again be heard in those further engagements and consultations. With regard to the 2022 examinations the Deputy referenced, adjusted assessment arrangements for students taking leaving certificate examinations next year were issued last August in advance of the school year beginning. These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experience of students during the Covid-19 pandemic, by incorporating adjustments in a manner similar to the initial adjustments that were made for the students taking examinations in 2021. Like departmental officials, I am keenly aware of the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our education system over the past two years, including its impact on students who were due to take their leaving certificate examinations in those years. I expect that the lessons to be learned from the pandemic will be considered and, where appropriate, will assist in informing the redevelopment of senior cycle and reducing undue stress going forward. I am conscious the Deputy referenced the 2022 exam and for that reason, I highlight the measures currently in place have been agreed by the advisory group and are being made available to schools.	spk_323
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	It is important to point out, as I have said previously, that within the education system, we have operated successfully on the basis of partnership and inclusion. The advisory group is advising on the examinations and how we would progress and was supportive and helpful in finding a pathway forward for the classes of 2020 and 2021. This group comprises students, parents, teachers and school representatives and, collectively, they agreed a process for the accommodations that would be made for 2020, 2021 and indeed, 2022. Those accommodations are in place and have been advised to schools. There is also a provision for a second sitting of the leaving certificate examination. Of course, we operate under the guidance of public health. Should there be any change in public health information or guidance, we will pivot and put in place other additional contingencies that might be required.	spk_325
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Departmental Staff	dbsect_23	I want to be clear that there is a mechanism in place in terms of the measures we bring in for accommodations, such as those for leaving certificate 2022. We work with the advisory group, which is a representative group. Significant measures are also in place. If there is to be a change in any public health advice to require any additional measures, we will keep everything under review. The measures introduced earlier are quite comprehensive and add to previous measures in place. We have made clear CPD, in the form of substitutional CPD, will be deferred until after the mid-term break. All those teachers and those who have been seconded to the Department for that work will be released and made available. All other avenues, in terms of other personnel, will also be kept under review.	spk_327
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_24	As the Deputy may be aware, the NCCA carried out a review of the senior cycle between 2016 and 2020, leading to the advisory report the Deputy has referenced. The review covered a number of areas, including the question of the overall identity and purposes of senior cycle education; how to establish continuity and progression with the new junior cycle; and the range of learning programmes and pathways available to students at senior cycle. In addition to this, the review considers: how best to improve flexibility and choice for students; the alignment of key skills with the needs of students; and the appropriate arrangements for assessment and certification in senior cycle. The NCCA review involved a broad range of research, consultations and communications with a wide variety of stakeholders, including students, on all aspects of review and redevelopment over a number of phases over the period of the review. In particular, the second phase, which took place over 2018 and 2019, involved a school review and national seminar series. Teachers, students and parents in a representative cross-section of schools nationwide took part in a review of the existing senior cycle. Review feedback was then analysed and emerging themes and areas for further exploration were identified. The third phase of the review also invited individuals and organisations, including students and student representative organisations, to participate in a public consultation process, leading to the publication of a public consultation report in December 2019. This consultation included 4,300 responses to an online consultation survey, as well as focus groups, meetings and the receipt by the NCCA of written submissions.The NCCA also commissioned external expertise to support the process, including the ESRI and the OECD. As I have mentioned, the NCCA submitted its advisory report to my Department. My officials and I have been considering the report carefully, with a view to delivering a senior cycle programme that meets the needs of the students of today and the future. While I do not wish to pre-empt the conclusion of that consideration process this evening, my priority in considering the report is to deliver a senior cycle for all guided by the goals set out in the programme for Government which place the needs, experience and success of learners, educators and the community at the heart of the approach.	spk_284

The main focus of resources over the past decade and, as the Deputy will appreciate, for the coming period is on the provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics, particularly at post-primary level and for special educational needs provision. The Deputy will appreciate the immediate priority of the Department is providing new and replacement school places each year to ensure every child has a school place. However, the second half of the national development plan period will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock. This will include a PE hall build and modernisation programme to ensure students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision. The ancillary accommodation needs of primary schools, such as general purpose rooms, will also be considered. Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on the Department's website. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.	spk_305
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_27	As I have previously outlined, the Department has a significant pipeline of projects to be delivered over the coming years to meet capacity need managed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme. This involves in excess of 1,200 school building projects across various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. The current delivery status of these projects is listed on a county by county basis on the website, as I have said to the Deputy. There are currently 377 schools, or 338 projects, listed on the large-scale capital programme, which would be expected to provide new PE halls at post-primary level where none already exist, or general purpose halls at primary level where none exist. Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately €4.4 billion in capital investment over the period of 2021 to 2025. The Deputy is correct the focus at present is on new builds and where there is a significant refurbishment of a school but equally I appreciate the importance of this area of provision. It is part of our plan going forward.	spk_307
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_27	I want to be very clear to the Deputy there is an absolute commitment from the Department to provide all the necessary provision and opportunities necessary within the education sector. It is true to say we have presided over the single greatest investment in education in the most recent budget. Equally, there is a breadth of vision for education with respect to the provision of new builds, senior cycle reform as discussed earlier and the provision for special educational needs referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan. There is an enormous breadth of vision for education and indeed enormous investment in education by the present Government. Specifically with new building and the refurbishment of existing buildings, there is a particular concentration at present on the provision of places for all students, but an equal emphasis is being placed on the provision of appropriate facilities and resources for students also.	spk_309
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Disadvantaged Status	dbsect_28	I thank the Deputy. I appreciate her taking the time to raise the question. Budget 2022, as the Deputy is aware, has provided for an allocation of €18 million for 2022 and €32 million for 2023 to extend the DEIS programme to further schools with the highest levels of disadvantage. This represents an increase of over 20% in funding for the DEIS programme and will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools. This year the Department will spend in the region of €150 million on providing supports for schools in the DEIS programme. The programme supports 884 schools and more than 180,000 learners. The Department's investment includes providing for in excess of 400 home school community liaison co-ordinators, in the region of €16 million in DEIS grants, additional posts for DEIS band 1 primary schools, curriculum supports, enhanced book grants, and access to the school completion programme. This year's package follows an extensive body of work that has been undertaken by the DEIS technical group on the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools.This work involved an initial process of consultation between the Department and the education partners on the technical aspects of the model. The purpose of the consultation is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application. Under DEIS plan 2017, the DEIS identification process is based on an objective statistics-based model to determine which schools merit inclusion in the programme. An extensive body of work has been undertaken by the DEIS technical group on developing the defined model. The key data sources used in the DEIS identification process are the Department of Education primary online database, the post-primary online databases and Central Statistics Office, CSO, data from the national census of population as represented in the Pobal HP deprivation index for small areas, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.	spk_311
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Disadvantaged Status	dbsect_28	I acknowledge that the Deputy is particularly invested in this issue. I would venture to say that the vast majority of Deputies are also invested in it, but she has been a particularly strong advocate for the schools she referenced and for the roll-out, enhancement and extension of the DEIS programme. She does not need to tell me - I am well aware of the importance of the DEIS programme. It is for that reason I am particularly pleased that during budget discussion and engagement I secured an additional allocation for the programme of €18 million for 2022, rising to €32 million in 2023, which will allow an extension of the programme as we go forward. It is important to note that schools are not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and that all schools will be considered under the refined model. It is also important to note that educational outcomes do not play any part in identification of schools for inclusion in the DEIS programme, either at primary or post-primary level.	spk_313
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Disadvantaged Status	dbsect_28	I appreciate the case the Deputy made. She is correct that the hot meals programme for schools does not fall within my remit but she will be aware that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, made some very positive announcements about it this week. I also acknowledge the other additional supports available to schools outside of the DEIS programme, notwithstanding its importance and the supports it provides and, as I said, the expectation that we are now looking forward to rolling it out even further. For example, I referenced previously the Covid-19 learning and support scheme, CLASS, which is a provision of up to €52 million for extra teaching hours that is being made available to all schools. This is another significant resource that is going into schools, specifically this year, to meet the challenge of Covid, not just from an academic and learning perspective but a holistic perspective, where children and young people will have opportunities to experience socialisation and all that goes with it.	spk_315
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_29	On 30 June 2021, I announced that adjustments would be made to the 2022 leaving certificate and junior cycle examinations. As in previous years, adjustments were developed in conjunction with the leaving certificate advisory group, which is important. This group includes representation from students, parents, teachers and schools. Details of these adjustments were issued to schools in August 2021 to ensure that students and staff could familiarise themselves with any changes. These arrangements acknowledge the disruption faced by this particular cohort of students because of the Covid-19 pandemic. I consider that these arrangements are proportionate to the students’ experience and loss of learning and are educationally appropriate. The adjustments ensure that the overall structure of exams remains intact but allows for greater choice for students. The level of adjustment will be similar to that applied by the assessment arrangements for junior cycle and leaving certificate examinations in 2021, as announced in December 2020. As part of the adjustments for the 2022 exams, I also announced that an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations will be run in 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of exams. These exams will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of exams due to close family bereavement and certain other categories of serious illness, to be determined with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, which govern all aspects of the exam system. The State Examinations Commission will issue further details regarding the 2022 examinations, guided by prevailing public health advice, which is an important consideration. There will be further engagement with stakeholders through the advisory group on planning for the State examinations, and with other stakeholders as appropriate, in advance of any detailed announcement.	spk_317
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_29	I acknowledge that the provision of an opportunity, in the midst of a pandemic, for students to avail of the accredited grades process and written exams was a remarkable achievement for the education sector. I acknowledge school leadership and school communities who, in a very difficult and challenging time, really pulled together to ensure that the classes of 2021 and 2020 would have an opportunity to find a pathway forward to sit a final State exam. One of the most interesting learnings from the process was the fact that there was such a high uptake for both options. There was a high uptake for the written exams, on which an element of doubt was cast originally. It was very interesting to see that students opted to maximise their potential. There are learnings from that but, equally, also from all we have known and experienced of senior cycle, in particular, prior to Covid.	spk_319
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_29	Clear guidance has been given to schools on how the exams will operate for 2022. This has been formulated via the advisory group, which includes parents, teachers, students and school management and, therefore, it has been the widest engagement of consultation. Those amendments and their offering of a wider choice has been communicated to schools. Students are now very familiar with that opportunity. Equally, I was clear in making the decision that a second opportunity for taking the leaving certificate exams would be made available as close as possible after the first sitting of leaving certificate. We continue to operate currently and going forward on the back of public health advice, and any contingencies that might be required as a consequence of that advice will be put in place.	spk_321
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Educational Reform	dbsect_30	Having worked for many years in the classroom, I appreciate that exam time and most notably, leaving certificate exam time, can be a stressful time for students. Of course, the pandemic has added to the additional challenges faced by all in the school sector. The decisions taken by Government on leaving certificate 2021, in the context of the impact on teaching and learning of the Covid-19 pandemic, were taken with the best interests of students in mind. The NCCA's advisory report on the senior cycle review has been submitted to me for consideration and will be published once that consideration is complete. Those considerations are being progressed with the best interests of students in mind.  The advisory report maps out, in broad terms, an ambitious programme of work, which would enable the development and construction of the components that would make up a framework for senior cycle and will involve further ongoing stakeholder engagement and consultation. The voices of students have contributed to the advisory report and will again be heard in those further engagements and consultations. With regard to the 2022 examinations the Deputy referenced, adjusted assessment arrangements for students taking leaving certificate examinations next year were issued last August in advance of the school year beginning. These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experience of students during the Covid-19 pandemic, by incorporating adjustments in a manner similar to the initial adjustments that were made for the students taking examinations in 2021. Like departmental officials, I am keenly aware of the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our education system over the past two years, including its impact on students who were due to take their leaving certificate examinations in those years. I expect that the lessons to be learned from the pandemic will be considered and, where appropriate, will assist in informing the redevelopment of senior cycle and reducing undue stress going forward. I am conscious the Deputy referenced the 2022 exam and for that reason, I highlight the measures currently in place have been agreed by the advisory group and are being made available to schools.	spk_323
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Educational Reform	dbsect_30	It is important to point out, as I have said previously, that within the education system, we have operated successfully on the basis of partnership and inclusion. The advisory group is advising on the examinations and how we would progress and was supportive and helpful in finding a pathway forward for the classes of 2020 and 2021. This group comprises students, parents, teachers and school representatives and, collectively, they agreed a process for the accommodations that would be made for 2020, 2021 and indeed, 2022. Those accommodations are in place and have been advised to schools. There is also a provision for a second sitting of the leaving certificate examination. Of course, we operate under the guidance of public health. Should there be any change in public health information or guidance, we will pivot and put in place other additional contingencies that might be required.	spk_325
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Educational Reform	dbsect_30	I want to be clear that there is a mechanism in place in terms of the measures we bring in for accommodations, such as those for leaving certificate 2022. We work with the advisory group, which is a representative group. Significant measures are also in place. If there is to be a change in any public health advice to require any additional measures, we will keep everything under review. The measures introduced earlier are quite comprehensive and add to previous measures in place. We have made clear CPD, in the form of substitutional CPD, will be deferred until after the mid-term break. All those teachers and those who have been seconded to the Department for that work will be released and made available. All other avenues, in terms of other personnel, will also be kept under review.	spk_327
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Mental Health Services	dbsect_32	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. It gives me the opportunity to set out for the House the position with regard to post-primary places in north Dublin for September 2022 and onwards. To plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, to identify where increasing school place requirements and associated accommodation needs will arise. However, it is important to note that where local enrolment pressures emerge, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by a number of factors, individually or collectively. One is duplication of applications, where pupils have applied for a place at a number of schools in the area. Another is school choice, when pupils cannot get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town or area. Some towns or areas have single-sex schools, and while places are available in the school, they are not available to all pupils. There is also the external draw, with pupils coming from outside the local area. One or a combination of these factors may be involved. The Department is working with relevant school authorities to establish the extent of enrolment pressures. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in north Dublin, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train. Where it is determined additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools, or provision of a new school or schools. Under Project Ireland 2040, the Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the school sector to meet demographic and other demands. The capital programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. It is expected the enrolment pressures in north Dublin and in other areas will reduce in the short term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. With regard to projects, there has been significant investment under the major capital programme in the north Dublin area in recent years. Bremore Educate Together, Balbriggan has a new school building for 1,000 pupils, which was completed in 2018. Coláiste Ghlór na Mara, also in Balbriggan, was completed in 2019 and also has accommodation for 1,000 pupils. In addition, there are 13 other major projects at post-primary level in the north Dublin area, including at Belmayne, Malahide, Portmarnock, Swords, Dublin 15 and Rush, which are at various stages of the design and build process and will greatly contribute to the supply of school places in the area. The capital programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified. Included among additional accommodation projects are Dominican College, Drumcondra, Coláiste Dhúlaigh, Coolock and Santa Sabina Dominican College, Sutton. Clonturk Community College has had a significant amount of modular accommodation approved to cater for its needs. St. Aidan's, Whitehall has been approved for a significant project, which has been devolved to the school authorities for delivery. The Department is also engaging with school authorities at Castleknock Community College and Luttrellstown Community College to consider their accommodation needs. I can assure the Deputy that the Department is working intensively to ensure there is sufficient post-primary school accommodation available throughout the country, including in north Dublin, to meet school place requirements in every area.	spk_331
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-23	dail	33	Mental Health Services	dbsect_32	As I previously outlined, in quantifying the specific requirements for September 2022, the Department is assessing its nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels across the 314 school planning areas through a geographical information system, GIS. The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including information from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Education school enrolment databases and much more to identify where pressures for school places across the country will arise. In line with a strengthened approach in recent years, the process involves specific initiatives such as enhanced engagement with local authorities, which is hugely important, and information on residential development because clearly, as the Deputy will appreciate, where houses go education goes as well. There is additional engagement with patron bodies in regard to their local knowledge on school place requirements and with education and training boards, diocesan offices, national patron bodies such as Educate Together and An Foras Pátrúnachta, etc. They can also be an important source of knowledge. This will add to the information also provided to the Department by local authorities or individual schools. Utilising the information gleaned from schools under the national inventory of school capacity completed by individual schools last year as part of the post-primary online database, PPOD, returns process is also significant.  I assure the Deputy that the Department will continue to engage with patron bodies in identifying specific September 2022 capacity pressure points, prioritise those pressure points going forward and put in place the necessary and very specific actions. As the Deputy will appreciate, the demands in one school are not necessarily mirrored in terms of demands in other schools. I assure the Deputy that I am very happy to engage with him in regard to the specific issues he raised in regard to his own area.	spk_333

Tugann sé deis dom an seasamh maidir le háiteanna iar-bhunscoile trí mheán na Gaeilge i mBaile Átha Cliath a leagan amach don Teach. Úsáidfidh mé idir Ghaeilge agus Bhéarla sa ráiteas seo. Chun pleanáil a dhéanamh don soláthar scoile, agus anailís a dhéanamh ar na sonraí ábhartha, déanann mo Roinn an tír a roinnt i 314 limistéar pleanála scoile. Úsáidtear córas GIS le sonraí ó raon leathan foinsí le fáil amach cá dtiocfaidh an brú ar áiteanna scoile ar fud na tíre agus cá mbeidh gá le cóiríocht bhreise scoile ag leibhéal na bunscoile agus na hiar-bhunscoile. Nuair a léiríonn na sonraí go bhfuil gá le soláthar breise ag leibhéal na bunscoile nó na hiar-bhunscoile, braitheann an soláthar breise sin ar na cúinsí áirithe a bhaineann le gach cás ar leith agus féadfar í a sholáthar trí na modhanna seo a leanas: úsáid a bhaint as acmhainn atá ann cheana i scoil nó scoileanna; acmhainn scoile nó scoileanna a leathnú agus scoil nó scoileanna nua a sholáthar. Déantar próiseas pátrúnachta a reáchtáil nuair a chinntear, bunaithe ar anailís agus ar fhianaise, go bhfuil gá le scoil nua. Bíonn an próiseas pátrúnachta seo oscailte do gach comhlacht pátrúin agus do phátrúin nua. Rinne mo Roinn an próiseas pátrúnachta ar líne a fhorbairt chun faisnéis chruinn a sholáthar do thuismitheoirí a dtabharfaidh deis dóibh rogha eolach a dhéanamh maidir le pátrúnacht agus a rogha teanga teagaisc. Is é sin Gaeilge nó Béarla, do na scoileanna nua. Parental preferences, as well as other considerations, such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area, including Irish-medium provision, are key to the decision-making process and whether a post-primary school would take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelcholáiste or whether that school, if English-medium, would include an Irish-medium unit or aonad. Most new post-primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of between 600 and 1,000 students. A lower threshold of 400 students may apply to Gaelcholáistí, having regard to the alternative of establishing an aonad within the school. Since April 2018, the Government has announced plans for the establishment of 47 new schools from 2019. This includes four new post-primary schools to serve the Dublin city-south Dublin area, two of which have been established as English-medium schools following a patronage process. Síltear go bhfuil dóthain áiteanna scoile sa ghearrthéarma ag na gaelcholáistí atá sa cheantar chun freastal ar an éileamh a tugadh faoi deara mar chuid de na próisis phátrúnachta a tharla le déanaí.

Equally, leanfaidh mo Roinn ag obair chun a chinntiú go bhfuil soláthar scoile an-mhaith ag cathair Bhaile Átha Cliath chun freastal ar an éileamh ar áiteanna scoileanna. Chomh maith leis sin, coimeádfar an riachtanas i mBaile Átha Cliath faoi athbhreithniú mar a tharlaíonn le gach réigiún pleanála scoile eile.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-11-02	dail	33	Scoileanna Lán-Ghaeilge	dbsect_39	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as an ábhar seo a ardú. Tugann sé deis dom an seasamh maidir le háiteanna iar-bhunscoile trí mheán na Gaeilge i mBaile Átha Cliath a leagan amach don Teach. Úsáidfidh mé idir Ghaeilge agus Bhéarla sa ráiteas seo. Chun pleanáil a dhéanamh don soláthar scoile, agus anailís a dhéanamh ar na sonraí ábhartha, déanann mo Roinn an tír a roinnt i 314 limistéar pleanála scoile. Úsáidtear córas GIS le sonraí ó raon leathan foinsí le fáil amach cá dtiocfaidh an brú ar áiteanna scoile ar fud na tíre agus cá mbeidh gá le cóiríocht bhreise scoile ag leibhéal na bunscoile agus na hiar-bhunscoile. Nuair a léiríonn na sonraí go bhfuil gá le soláthar breise ag leibhéal na bunscoile nó na hiar-bhunscoile, braitheann an soláthar breise sin ar na cúinsí áirithe a bhaineann le gach cás ar leith agus féadfar í a sholáthar trí na modhanna seo a leanas: úsáid a bhaint as acmhainn atá ann cheana i scoil nó scoileanna; acmhainn scoile nó scoileanna a leathnú agus scoil nó scoileanna nua a sholáthar. Déantar próiseas pátrúnachta a reáchtáil nuair a chinntear, bunaithe ar anailís agus ar fhianaise, go bhfuil gá le scoil nua. Bíonn an próiseas pátrúnachta seo oscailte do gach comhlacht pátrúin agus do phátrúin nua. Rinne mo Roinn an próiseas pátrúnachta ar líne a fhorbairt chun faisnéis chruinn a sholáthar do thuismitheoirí a dtabharfaidh deis dóibh rogha eolach a dhéanamh maidir le pátrúnacht agus a rogha teanga teagaisc. Is é sin Gaeilge nó Béarla, do na scoileanna nua. Parental preferences, as well as other considerations, such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area, including Irish-medium provision, are key to the decision-making process and whether a post-primary school would take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelcholáiste or whether that school, if English-medium, would include an Irish-medium unit or aonad. Most new post-primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of between 600 and 1,000 students. A lower threshold of 400 students may apply to Gaelcholáistí, having regard to the alternative of establishing an aonad within the school. Since April 2018, the Government has announced plans for the establishment of 47 new schools from 2019. This includes four new post-primary schools to serve the Dublin city-south Dublin area, two of which have been established as English-medium schools following a patronage process. Síltear go bhfuil dóthain áiteanna scoile sa ghearrthéarma ag na gaelcholáistí atá sa cheantar chun freastal ar an éileamh a tugadh faoi deara mar chuid de na próisis phátrúnachta a tharla le déanaí. Cuirtear san áireamh freisin líon na ngaelscoileanna nua a osclaíodh le blianta beaga anuas nó atá beartaithe. Ach tá an cás á choinneáil faoi athbhreithniú gníomhach ag mo Roinn de réir mar a fhásann na scoileanna seo agus de réir mar a thagann méadú ar an líon daltaí rang 6 i ngaelscoileanna. In 2014, two new Gaelcholáistí were established in Dublin city, namely, Gaelcholáiste an Phiarsaigh, in the Ballinteer-Stepaside area, and Coláiste Ghlór na Mara, in Balbriggan.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-10-20	dail	33	Emergency Departments	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which has been raised consistently with me by Deputy Calleary and Senator Chambers. As Deputy Ring outlined, I met a deputation from the school and was happy to do so. Nevertheless, this Topical Issue matter gives me an opportunity to set out for the House the position with regard to Holy Trinity National School. Holy Trinity is a co-educational primary school under Church of Ireland patronage. The school had an enrolment of 63 pupils in the 2020-21 school year and a staffing of one principal, two mainstream class teachers and one special education teaching post. It is currently situated on a patron-owned site in a permanent building in the heart of Westport, comprising three classrooms and ancillary accommodation. The Department has a large-scale and ambitious plan for the roll-out of school building projects under the national development plan, NDP, and as part of Project Ireland 2040. The continuation of construction work on school building projects during the lockdown period in early 2021 was an important enabler in facilitating the delivery of our school building programme. Significant increased funding is provided to the school sector capital investment programme under the NDP. My Department’s focus for capital investment in recent years has been the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and this is expected to continue to be a driver of capital investment in the short to medium term.During the NDP period from 2018 to 2020, 526 building projects were completed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme. These projects delivered in excess of 48,000 school places, including permanent accommodation for 229 special classes, and additional capacity for 67 classrooms in 14 special schools throughout the country. The Department has a significant existing pipeline of projects to be delivered over the coming years to meet capacity needs. This is managed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme. This will make significant progress in providing modern energy-efficient school facilities and the replacement of temporary accommodation. A building project to construct a new school building for Holy Trinity National School is included in the Department’s large-scale capital programme. It is the Department’s intention, subject to securing the usual statutory consents, that the school will be relocated to a Minister-owned site at Altamont Street, Westport. In line with the public spending code, to maximise the use of State assets consideration must be given to the potential to master-plan the Altamont Street site to accommodate a second primary school. This proposal has required engagement with the local authority and my Department is now in the process of finalising its assessment of this potential solution. This assessment is also incorporating current projections of future school place requirements, which were recently updated. These projections of future school place demand are modelled using data from a range of sources, including school enrolments, attendance patterns and information on current and planned residential development activity. The Department also works closely with the National Council for Special Education in anticipating requirements for special education needs provision. Once the full assessment process is complete, my Department will be in further contact with the patron bodies of the schools in question, including Holy Trinity National School. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I assure him that my Department is concerned, at all times, with ensuring the accommodation needs of schools in Westport are appropriately advanced.	spk_7
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-10-20	dail	33	Emergency Departments	dbsect_3	It is my primary objective, at all times, that all schools are treated fairly in the process.

I am obliged to do that but I hear very clearly the case the Deputy makes. I assure him that the Department is in consultation with the local authority and is in the process of finalising the assessment of the potential and possibilities on the site. The assessment includes the present and future potential needs of schools. I confirm that fairness is at the core of all that I seek to achieve in this regard. I wish to ensure the needs of children in Westport are suitably addressed. I assure the Deputy that I am giving full consideration to what needs to be done. That is my intention and that of my officials, whose paramount interest is that the needs of all will be served. We are working on this matter and will continue to do so. As soon as we have expedited all issues in regard to potential opportunities on the site and the needs of schools, which is most important, we will bring it to completion. I am conscious of the issues raised by the Deputy and they have been raised, as I said previously, by others in the constituency.	spk_9

All the operations within our schools, from their reopening and the measures we put in place at that time, have been under the direction of public health authorities, and those authorities continue to make judgments on the operation of our schools where there may be a Covid-19 incident. It was a request of school management and leaders that no individual school would have that burden of responsibility placed upon it. We are required to follow public health advice as it is issued. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which has also been raised with me on a consistent basis by the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne. Today gives me an opportunity to clarify the position of the Department of Education's plans for upgrading school buildings, including the Christian Brothers Secondary School, New Ross. The Deputy may be aware that CBS New Ross is a Catholic, co-educational post-primary school in New Ross with an enrolment in 2020 of 397 pupils. This represents an increase of 24% in the past five years. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department approved capital funding for CBS New Ross in 2019 for the provision of four general classrooms, including one general classroom prefab replacement, one special education teaching room, one design and communication graphics room and one home economics room. This project was devolved to the school authorities for delivery and they were approved to go to planning in July 2021, which I was pleased to see. My Department's planning and building unit also received an application in June 2017 from CBS New Ross seeking capital funding for the provision of a physical education, PE, hall. The school authority was informed in writing that it is currently not possible to consider this application. Under the national development plan, increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme, which is an extremely positive and proactive step. This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities in post-primary schools. During the national development plan period for 2018 to 2020, there were 526 completed building projects under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme. These projects delivered in excess of 48,000 school places, including permanent accommodation for 229 special classes and additional capacity for 67 classrooms in 14 special schools throughout the country. The Department also has a significant existing pipeline of projects to be delivered over the coming years to meet capacity needs, managed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme. This will make significant progress in providing modern, energy-efficient school facilities and the replacement of temporary accommodation. The immediate priority of my Department is providing 20,000 new and replacement school places each year to ensure every child has a school place. However, later in the national development plan period there will be an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock. This will include a physical education hall build and modernisation programme to ensure students in all post-primary schools have access to these facilities. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the current position with that type of school build.	spk_11

When my diary allows it, I will be absolutely happy to visit. I am certainly very conscious of the Deputy's invitation. I appreciate the case made by the Deputy. There is positive news in what I have to say and I appreciate that the Deputy has acknowledged that. The Department currently has a significant pipeline of projects in train for delivery to the 4,000 schools in my care as Minister for Education. For example, in the year ahead we have more than 200 projects that will be on-site and going to construction for the 2022 period. We are looking at a net spend of more than €792 million on capital projects for 2022, which is a significant envelope of funding. I am conscious of the need to progress PE halls, as the Deputy has referenced. I am pleased to be able to say that as part of the national development programme, there will be an increased focus on refurbishment of existing buildings, specifically including PE hall build and modernisation. I am determined that we will deliver on that as soon as possible.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-10-13	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 2: General (Resumed)	dbsect_19	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom. I am pleased to confirm to this House a €9.2 billion investment in education as a consequence of budget 2022. It is a significant investment but it is both richly appropriate and deserved by the education sector. From my experience as a teacher I know of the transformative power of education. It has power to facilitate every child and young person not just in reaching their supposed full potential but to go beyond it. There is power in education to transform families and communities. The investment of €9.2 billion in education allows us to have significant breadth of ambition for education, meaning we can advance a number of key initiatives. Among these are the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme, which will see €18 million invested in the coming year, increasing to €32 million in 2023. This will ensure the DEIS model is significantly expanded to bring in the most deserving and significantly disadvantaged schools to the programme. In special education we have an ambitious programme of 980 special education teachers and 1,165 additional special needs assistants, SNAs, coming on stream next year. This brings the total number of SNAs to over 19,000. We have the single biggest investment ever in special education and at €2 billion it is more than 20% of the entire budget of the Department of Education, which is right. There will be a reduction of one point in the pupil-teacher ratio from 25:1 to 24:1. This in turn will result in an additional 350 new teaching posts being made available to our schools. With the school building programme we are looking at an investment of €792 million, delivering more than 200 school building projects next year. There will be an additional €30 million made available for summer work schemes, bringing total investment to €65 million for the 2022 schemes. To be fair, this scheme is used expertly and judiciously within our school communities and it is worth that further investment of €30 million. There will be an additional €30 million for the school transport scheme, bringing total investment to €270 million for the year ahead. This significantly supports more than 114,000 students. The House is aware we have had significant investment in ICT in the past year, with over €100 million being made available to schools. In addition to this, before the year closes, an additional €50 million will be made available. In total, between last year and this year, this means investment of €150 million for ICT. I am also pleased to confirm to the House that I have secured on a permanent footing at least one day of release for teaching principals, which is a significant move forward for such principals and an acknowledgement of their workload. Teaching principals in special schools or schools with two special education classes will now become administrative principals. I also draw the attention of Members to a new reading book initiative worth €20 million. This investment will facilitate the purchase in schools of reading books, audiobooks, braille books, picture books or whatever is deemed appropriate by school bodies. The intention is to promote the joy in words and language and the beauty of literature. It is about inculcating in students a particular appreciation of the written word while fostering in our students the ability to become the next generation of creative writers in the world of literature. As a member of the Government I take the last few minutes to welcome the overall budgetary package of €86.6 billion, which brings security and stability to the country after such a long period of Covid-19 challenges. This investment allows us to think in a forward way and be proactive in our action, and this comes as a result of our very successful vaccination programme, which has been bought into by all of society. The whole of the Government is now in a position to be able to think and plan for beyond a time of Covid-19. I welcome in particular measures such as investment in the childcare sector, social welfare, health and housing, which are initiatives that will have a positive impact not only in my county of Kerry but across the entire country. I refer also to measures like aviation supports for regional airports, the continuation of the wage subsidy scheme until 2022 and a targeted rates waiver in the fourth quarter of 2021 for businesses not yet fully open. This demonstrates broad ambition as we make our way forward out of Covid-19.	spk_169
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	Apprenticeship Programmes	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy. Ensuring that schools can open and operate sustainably has been a key priority for me as Minister for Education. To support this objective, the Department of Education has engaged extensively with all of the education stakeholders, the Department of Health and the public health team in the HSE. All schools across Ireland have fully reopened safely after the summer break, which is hugely welcome, as the Deputy acknowledged. Public health has reviewed the measures put in place to ensure safe operation of schools and has advised that the new variants of the disease do not change the infection prevention and control measures required in schools. The Department has been always guided by public health advice on appropriate Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures. Those measures protect students, their parents and school staff, and are effective.  Each school was provided with an updated Covid-19 response plan in advance of the return to school. Significant additional resources of €639 million were put into schools in the last academic year to keep schools safe. Further funding of €57.6 million has been paid by way of Covid-19 capitation to schools for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures for this term alone. This funding will cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures, personal protective equipment, PPE, requirements, enhanced cleaning supports and supervision. At primary level, additional management resources for principal release days were provided for principals and deputy principals. Principals have one day per week away from teaching duties to concentrate on leading teaching and learning and administration duties. Teacher supply panels were also expanded to cover the majority of primary schools nationwide. The Deputy specifically referenced the CO2 monitors that were recommended. Measures have been put in place to ensure that CO2 monitors will be provided in our schools. Some 96% of primary schools and all our special schools have their allocation. Indeed, each of our post-primary schools has at least ten monitors. There was an issue with the supplier, Lennox Laboratories, which was identified. Lennox has now informed the Department that resources, in terms of CO2 monitors, will be made available in October. In the meantime, should schools wish to purchase them on the ground, the opportunity for local purchase has been made available.	spk_108

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	Apprenticeship Programmes	dbsect_18	Managing ventilation is just one of a suite of public health measures in place to keep our schools safe. Updated guidance for schools on practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices in schools was provided at the end of May, following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing Covid-19. A copy of the guidance is published on the gov.ie website. The overarching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. The guidance outlines that carbon dioxide monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas or rooms may not be adequately ventilated.They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The Department procured portable monitors, as recommended, and these are currently being distributed to schools at a rate of between two and 20 per school at primary school level and between 20 and 35 at post-primary school level, depending on school size, at an estimated overall cost of €4 million. The monitors are portable, simple to use and will give a digital reading. The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use on those rooms where they will be most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. Deliveries of CO2 monitors to schools commenced in the third week of August. In total, it involves over 35,000 CO2 monitors being distributed to primary and post-primary schools. Some 25,000 CO2 monitors have been distributed to schools. This has facilitated monitors being provided to each school with 96% of primary schools, including all special schools, having received their full allocation of CO2 monitors. Ten CO2 monitors have been provided to schools at post-primary level with the balance of their allocation expected to be distributed in October. As I have said earlier, should they wish, schools have the option to purchase monitors locally rather than drawing down from the central framework. With regard to the Deputy's reference to scrimping on expenditure in schools, more than €635 million has been allocated for Covid measures within our schools in this past year, including €57 million for this first term alone. There has been no scrimping on Covid measures for the school sector.	spk_116
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	Apprenticeship Programmes	dbsect_18	I have to disagree with much of what the Deputy has said. It was the view of the expert group under Professor Wenger that portable CO2 monitors should be provided. The Deputy should be mindful that monitors are just that; they monitor when it is best to increase ventilation. This might mean opening additional windows or doors or whatever the case might be. They just give an instruction. That is all that they do. I acknowledge that there is already excellent practice within the schools sector. Indeed, Professor Wenger himself commented on the excellent guidelines provided to schools. It was envisaged that these monitors would be used as a spot check. That is why they are portable. They can be moved from room to room. With specific regard to air filtration or any additional measures that might be required, the Department is prepared and is working with schools. If any additional measures are required to increase ventilation, these can be carried out under the minor works scheme or the expertise of an engineer or architect can be provided either locally or from the Department and, if works are necessary, they will be carried out as emergency works. If air filters are required in the short term, they can also be put in place.	spk_118

I want to be very clear that all of the mitigation measures recommended by the public health officials are in place in our schools and remain in our schools despite what is happening in wider society. These are rigorous measures. The advice offered yesterday is the best expert medical advice of the CMO and NPHET, who have collectively reviewed all of the population data relating to the cohort of children under 13 years of age. It is their expert view that the reopening of schools has not led to an increased incidence of Covid-19 among schoolgoing children or the wider population. I have discussed this with Professor Philip Nolan who, as the Deputy will be aware, is carrying out the modelling and it is the expert view of NPHET that, prior to the schools returning, the positivity level among children under 13 years of age was at 15%. On the return to school, that rate is now 5%. These measures are being introduced on foot of expert data analysis and the advice of the CMO, Dr. Tony Holohan, and NPHET.	spk_120
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	Apprenticeship Programmes	dbsect_18	In the programme for Government, there is a strong commitment to making further progress in reducing the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools and supporting small schools. As part of budget 2021 measures, the Government has sought to deliver on this commitment by the announcement of a one-point change to the primary staffing schedule and the introduction of a three-point reduction in the number of pupils required to retain a teacher. For the 2021-22 school year, the staffing schedule is on the basis of one classroom teacher for every 25 pupils. This budget improvement has resulted in the lowest pupil-teacher ratio ever at primary school. The latest figures relating to pupil-teacher ratio show an improved pupil-teacher ratio from 16:1 to 14.5:1 at primary level, when comparing the 2015-16 school year to the 2020-21 school year. This compares favourably with the OECD pupil-teacher ratio, which is 15:1. In the same period, the staffing schedule moved from 28:1 to 25:1 for this school year. The most recent budget announcement will continue this positive trend of improving class sizes this school year. Statistics on this will be published later in the year. The staffing schedule, which now stands at a historical low, will help to ensure better teacher retention in primary school and that less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher. Significant improvements have been made in terms of pupil-teacher ratio, looking from 2016 through to 2021. It has been a considerable achievement that we are at an historically low level of 25:1. I appreciate and know from experience that there are always opportunities to do more. I am committed to doing all we can to reduce that further. We have a significant budget and will have a further budget coming before us in October. There will be considerable negotiation involved in that but there is a strong commitment under the programme for Government to address the issue of pupil-teacher ratio further.	spk_130

I know from my experience in the classroom the importance of continuing to pursue this direction. I reiterate the strong Government commitment to doing that. It is worth repeating that 25:1 is an historic low in our schools. A budget of €8.9 billion is significant, particularly when one looks at other Departments, and shows the priority that is placed on education. We are further resourcing schools this year through the class programme, which is to provide additional learning support in schools. We have made provision for additional teaching hours for schools this year, specifically as a Covid measure. For example, an 800-pupil school will have 900 hours, which is one and a half full posts for a school year.	spk_132

A further commitment is that we are making available to schools additional teaching resources in terms of teaching and learning for pupils, who may even more so this year have felt disadvantaged because of Covid. That is significant. An 800-pupil school will get 900 hours, which is 51 weeks teaching or one and a half full posts for a year. It is a significant additional investment in our schools.Equally, I would point to the three-point reduction that was brought in as a consequence of the budget last year which allowed for the retention of a teacher within a school.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	Apprenticeship Programmes	dbsect_18	It is important to acknowledge that apprenticeships represent a meaningful, valuable and realistic pathway for all learners. That is hugely important. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science published the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 earlier this year. Under the plan, the development of apprenticeship taster courses will be explored as part of transition year and senior cycle reform with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA. The leaving certificate vocational, LCV, programme operating in our schools is designed to enhance the vocational dimension of the leaving certificate established, with a focus on enterprise and preparing students for working life. The leaving certificate applied, LCA, programme in our schools also includes modules on vocational preparation, including work experience and enterprise. The Deputy will be aware that the NCCA has undertaken an extensive review of senior cycle programmes and vocational pathways, including transition year, the leaving certificate applied, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate established. A key theme of this review is the future form and reform of the existing senior cycle programmes. This includes the range of learning programmes and pathways available to students at senior cycle, with an express desire that senior cycle should provide adequate supports for whatever progression pathways students choose. The important consideration here is that the senior cycle must be in a position, as the Deputy has outlined, to provide a myriad of pathways forward for students, whatever those pathways might be and however they determine themselves. The Department of Education is considering the report and other aspects of the NCCA's advisory report, as I have outlined, and it will be published shortly. There is a very clear understanding that we are looking towards and focusing on providing as many pathways forward and diversity for students as possible.	spk_136
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	Apprenticeship Programmes	dbsect_18	I am very much open on this, and the Deputy is pushing an open door here. I absolutely want the new senior cycle, as we are talking about senior cycle review, to offer maximum potential and possibility to all students. As for even more pre-apprenticeship courses, as the Deputy referred to, pre-apprenticeship programmes are targeted at young people aged, we will say, from 16 to 24 and the aim is progression to an apprenticeship. They are designed to give young people the skills, confidence and connections they need to access and successfully complete an apprenticeship. A call for expressions of interest issued at the end of 2019 for the development of pre-apprenticeship programmes involving approximately 500 learner places to roll out from quarter 1 of 2020. Over 589 Pathways to Apprenticeship places were subsequently awarded to post-leaving certificate, PLC, providers. Students and learners can access information on this on the website.

Specifically regarding teaching principals, I am very conscious of that and of rural schools and was very pleased to be in a position to introduce the additional administrative day leave for teachers in order that teaching principals were guaranteed at least one day per week. We successfully ensured in the vast majority of cases, where a network of five schools or whatever clustered, that a designated day was made available for the administrative work that needed to be done by principals, deputy principals or whoever else in the school, and that is important. Even in the wider sector of education in terms of Covid measures, whether it was exams at post-primary level or whatever else, I was always very conscious of the need to put in place, for example, assistance that could be provided to school leadership, whether exam aid or whatever else, and even for the return to school aid was provided. I am very conscious of that. I hope to build on that. It has worked very well in our school system. I have a unique understanding of and appreciation for the issues the Deputy has raised, whether in small schools or larger schools.	spk_140
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	I thank the Deputy. Ensuring that schools can open and operate sustainably has been a key priority for me as Minister for Education. To support this objective, the Department of Education has engaged extensively with all of the education stakeholders, the Department of Health and the public health team in the HSE. All schools across Ireland have fully reopened safely after the summer break, which is hugely welcome, as the Deputy acknowledged. Public health has reviewed the measures put in place to ensure safe operation of schools and has advised that the new variants of the disease do not change the infection prevention and control measures required in schools. The Department has been always guided by public health advice on appropriate Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures. Those measures protect students, their parents and school staff, and are effective.  Each school was provided with an updated Covid-19 response plan in advance of the return to school. Significant additional resources of €639 million were put into schools in the last academic year to keep schools safe. Further funding of €57.6 million has been paid by way of Covid-19 capitation to schools for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures for this term alone. This funding will cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures, personal protective equipment, PPE, requirements, enhanced cleaning supports and supervision. At primary level, additional management resources for principal release days were provided for principals and deputy principals. Principals have one day per week away from teaching duties to concentrate on leading teaching and learning and administration duties. Teacher supply panels were also expanded to cover the majority of primary schools nationwide. The Deputy specifically referenced the CO2 monitors that were recommended.

I have a unique understanding of and appreciation for the issues the Deputy has raised, whether in small schools or larger schools.	spk_140

My Department's commitment to supporting Irish-medium education and promoting the use of Irish in Irish-medium schools is evidenced by the progress which has been made by the Department, along with partners, in implementing the actions set out in the Government's 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, the five-year action plan for the Irish language and my Department's Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022. An estimated budget of €20.3 million, a significant budget, has been allocated to support the implementation of actions arising from the policy on Gaeltacht education since its commencement in 2017. This includes the provision of a range of additional resources such as grant supports and additional teaching hours provided annually to schools participating in the Gaeltacht school recognition scheme. Further supports are being provided to five post-primary island schools. Regarding staffing, primary schools in the Gaeltacht are allowed a more favourable appointment and retention staffing schedule. At post-primary level, an additional post is allocated to all Irish-medium post-primary schools both within and outside the Gaeltacht. Gaelscoileanna outside of the Gaeltacht are in receipt of additional capitation at a rate of €23 per pupil, in addition to the standard capitation rate paid to all primary schools. This is to give an extra incentive for Gaelscoileanna to promote the use of the Irish language in their school communities. An additional An additional €110.50 per pupil is paid to schools where students are taught all subjects through Irish. Where some subjects are taught through Irish, an extra €22 is paid for each student, per subject, up to a maximum of four subjects. Irish-medium teacher education has been supported through the provision of ongoing continuing professional development and upskilling options for teachers. In addition, funding is also being provided for places on two new Irish-medium teacher education programmes, allowing for up to 60 new funded places annually.	spk_142
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_24	I reiterate that there is an enormous commitment to this issue within the Department. The funding in excess of €20 million speaks for itself. Significant work has been done and supports put in place, not just for the teaching of the Irish language but also for providing supports to Irish-medium schools within Gaeltacht areas and, indeed, outside them. Work has commenced on the development of a new policy for Irish-medium education, as outlined in the programme for Government, with the view to providing a framework for the delivery of a high-quality Irish-medium education in Irish-medium schools and early learning and care settings outside the Gaeltacht. The new policy will complement the separate policy on Gaeltacht education, which will continue to support early learning and care settings and schools within Gaeltacht areas. Efforts to promote extended use of Irish in local communities and the implementation of local Gaeltacht language plans are set out in the Gaeltacht Act 2012. An interdepartmental working group has been established within the Department to progress this work as efficiently as possible. The planned next steps to be taken to inform the development of the new policy include the commissioning of a review of relevant national and international literature and research, along with an extensive consultation process with key stakeholders. Implementation of the policy will commence following the conclusion of all necessary stages of policy development, including comprehensive and extensive stakeholder engagement, which is vital to ensuring well-informed policy development. As regards the leaving certificate specifications, there was an extension of the consultation process in that regard. This is important because the wider the consultation, the more effective it will be.	spk_144

An extensive body of work has been undertaken in terms of the refinement of this model based on the latest school enrolment data and data available from the 2016 census under the HP deprivation index. A detailed quality analysis of the data has been carried out by members of the DEIS technical group, which contains representatives of the Department’s statistics and social inclusion units, the inspectorate and the educational research centre. My Department has commenced a consultation process with education partners on the technical aspects of this model and work is ongoing on its final elements. It is envisaged that it will provide the basis for the development and application of a refined DEIS resource allocation model to ultimately match resources to identified need. All schools will be considered for inclusion under the refined DEIS model. Until this work is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools. Nonetheless, additional resources have been made available to DEIS schools in order to address educational disadvantage, such as an increase in the budget for the school completion programme, the expanded summer programme which ran this year and which, incidentally, was open to all schools at primary and post-primary levels for the first time, and the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio for DEIS band 1 schools, as well as for all other schools. As noted earlier, it is at a historic low of 25:1. While this work continues, there have been significant other resources put in place for schools that do not currently have DEIS status. That said, the work will be expedited as quickly as possible. Stakeholders are currently being consulted on it.	spk_156

It is at a very advanced stage - it is at consultation stage with stakeholders, which is important. We are in the final stages of it but it is an enormous body of work. There is an enormous number of schools within the remit of the Department.

Equally important, as I previously stated, are the additional resources that are now going directly into schools via the class programme, meaning that an 800-pupil school will have 51 additional weeks of teaching, which amounts to 1.5 additional teaching posts for a school year. Therefore, significant resources are being employed in advance of the completion of the DEIS programme.	spk_158

I have absolutely no difficulty with anybody bringing forward ideas in relation to it. A very wide consultation, which predates my term in office, was completed. Following the 2017 inclusion of additional DEIS schools, a line was drawn under it so as to allow this process to continue and be completed. I appreciate the urgency around it.

Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13 September, significant progress has been made in this dispute.

I acknowledge that in respect of the union, the Departments, given that this involves the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well as my Department, and the WRC. To give some background, on 13 September the parties engaged at the WRC, whereby the Department, subject to the agreement of all elements of the claim, made an offer. That is important. We have referenced the pay scale, but it is subject to the agreement of all other elements of the claim. We offered to align school secretary pay rates to that of the clerical officer grade 3 pay scale within the education and training boards. As I said, this included agreement on the implementation date of 1 September 2021. Discussions in the WRC last week focused on the very significant concessions around pay that have been offered to Fórsa on behalf of school secretaries and signalled that further talks are to take place on matters relating to the implementation of the pay scale and leave arrangements, etc. As set out in the joint statement following the WRC engagement in May 2021, it was acknowledged that the issue of public service status is more complex and needs to have regard to the state of the public finances and the repercussive effects. I acknowledge that one follows the other and there continues to be discussion as regards all matters.	spk_165
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_24	I appreciate the points the Deputies have made. They do not have to tell me the value of school secretaries and caretakers. I have worked all my teaching life in the school sector and I am very familiar with the work of school secretaries and, indeed, caretakers. Specifically on some of the points that have been made, a phased approach is being taken to these discussions. The first phase was on aligning the specific pay rates with those of a grade 3 clerical officer. However, there is an understanding and an agreement by all parties that no single aspect of the claim will be regarded as resolved or conceded until agreement is reached on the resolution of all aspects. That principle will continue to apply during the course of the current talks. There was a question on why there was an advancement in respect of school secretaries. The necessary data have been collected on secretaries and therefore there has been an advancement in respect of them. Fewer data are available on caretakers. Data need to be collected so there will be clarity on the caretaker issue. It has been acknowledged that, in principle, what applies to one category applies to the other. There has been great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and a generosity and willingness to come to the table to engage in discussion and find the pathway forward. The most positive aspect of this has been the willingness of all concerned to address the issues as they need to be addressed and to do so as expeditiously as possible. I appreciate the points made by previous speakers on the time span but it is our wish to bring this to a conclusion as soon as we possibly can.	spk_169
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_24	Managing ventilation is just one of a suite of public health measures in place to keep our schools safe. Updated guidance on practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices in schools was provided at the end of May, following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing Covid-19. A copy of the guidance is published on the website  My Department procured portable monitors. They are currently being distributed to schools, with allocations of between two and 20 at primary school level and between 20 and 35 at post-primary school level, depending on school size, at an estimated overall cost of €4 million. The monitors are portable, simple to use and will give a digital reading. Deliveries of carbon dioxide monitors to schools commenced in the third week of August. In total, the process involves over 35,000 monitors being distributed to primary and post-primary schools. Some 25,000 carbon dioxide monitors have been distributed to schools, which has facilitated the provision of monitors to each school. Ninety-six percent of primary schools, including all special schools, have received their full allocation of carbon dioxide monitors. Ten monitors, at a minimum, have been provided to each school at post-primary level, with the balance of each allocation expected to be distributed in October. An issue arose with Lennox over the final balance of carbon dioxide monitors but provision has been made for them to arrive in schools in October. Schools have the autonomy to purchase carbon dioxide monitors locally if they wish and deem it necessary.	spk_171
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_24	I thank the Deputy. There is international demand for carbon dioxide monitors. We ordered them more than four months ago. We are moving into the fifth month now. Ninety-six percent of our primary schools are in possession of their allocation of carbon dioxide monitors. All of our special schools have received their allocation, and all of our post-primary schools have a minimum of ten monitors. Complementing the guidance already available to schools — the excellent guidance on the operation of ventilation in our schools — it was suggested, through the expert group under Professor John Wenger, that the monitors be portable. The idea was that they could spot-check and be moved from room to room. We accepted that and therefore we ordered them centrally. Where there is a small shortfall, schools do have the autonomy to purchase locally. Where issues arise regarding ventilation in a school, whether they concern the need for improved vent or window work or otherwise, funding is available for that school through the minor works scheme. Alternatively, emergency funding applications can be made. If there are bigger issues, there is absolutely no question but that the expertise of the Department, be it in engineering or another area, can be availed of.If any additional measures are required to be put in place and have been done in other cases, we will continue to do that on a case-by-case basis also. There is no question of our sourcing and resourcing this area within our schools.	spk_173
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_24	I thank the Deputy for his question. The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the 2020-21 school year, more than 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over €224.7 million in 2020. All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time for the 2021-22 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. This year I have extended measures to all post-primary pupils who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school. Prior to this it was their nearest school but this year I have extended it to ensure that the second nearest school is also part of the framework. All those who have applied and paid on time will be accommodated on school transport services. This arrangement is in place for the current school year pending completion of the full review of the school transport scheme.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis and are offered seats where capacity exists after all eligible children have been catered for. Late applications or families who pay late or both are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats have been allocated to those who have applied and paid on time for services for the 2021-22 school year.  Planning for school transport for the 2021-22 school year has proceeded on the basis that the public health measures in place as schools closed at the end of the last school year would remain as term began in this new school year. This includes the recommendations from public health that post-primary services would operate at 50% capacity and that masks would be worn. However, as the vaccination programme for children on post-primary services is rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeds, the capacity limit of 50% on post-primary school transport services will be subject to ongoing review and the Department will be considering the position in this regard over the coming weeks. Bus Éireann has confirmed that to date, 104,324 pupils, including 54,728 post-primary eligible pupils and 14,735 post-primary concessionary pupils have been issued tickets for the school transport scheme. This number is changing as tickets continue to be allocated to pupils. In the region of 98% of all valid and paid-on-time applicants have been issued with a ticket.	spk_177

I am a rural Deputy myself and I understand that and the importance of the school transport system. We have made significant progress in the past year in addressing many of the issues that were problematic last year. This has been helped in no small measure by the review that is in place and as a consequence of the decision I made to ensure that the second nearest school would also be part of the terms of agreement for access to school transport. The figures and the statistics speak for themselves, in that 98% of all valid and paid-on-time applicants have been issued with a ticket. That is a phenomenal figure to be able to discuss with the House here today. On specific cases that the Deputy might raise, there is always a mechanism where, if there is an exception for whatever reason, whether due to family circumstances not allowing payment on time or if something has happened, this can be reviewed.	spk_179

I wish to acknowledge again that in the region of 98% of all valid and paid-on-time applicants have been issued a ticket. This is a significant percentage but as I have also already alluded to earlier, a further percentage change will happen because tickets are continuing to be issued. This is distinct progress on where we were in previous years.  I also note the comments of the Deputies in moving from 50% to 100% but this will be done on the back of public health advice and prudence for our students.	spk_185

Discussions in the WRC last week focused on the very significant concessions around pay that have been offered to Fórsa on behalf of school secretaries and signalled that further talks are to take place on matters relating to the implementation of the pay scale and leave arrangements, etc. As set out in the joint statement following the WRC engagement in May 2021, it was acknowledged that the issue of public service status is more complex and needs to have regard to the state of the public finances and the repercussive effects. I acknowledge that one follows the other and there continues to be discussion as regards all matters.	spk_165
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_28	I appreciate the points the Deputies have made. They do not have to tell me the value of school secretaries and caretakers. I have worked all my teaching life in the school sector and I am very familiar with the work of school secretaries and, indeed, caretakers. Specifically on some of the points that have been made, a phased approach is being taken to these discussions. The first phase was on aligning the specific pay rates with those of a grade 3 clerical officer. However, there is an understanding and an agreement by all parties that no single aspect of the claim will be regarded as resolved or conceded until agreement is reached on the resolution of all aspects. That principle will continue to apply during the course of the current talks. There was a question on why there was an advancement in respect of school secretaries. The necessary data have been collected on secretaries and therefore there has been an advancement in respect of them. Fewer data are available on caretakers. Data need to be collected so there will be clarity on the caretaker issue. It has been acknowledged that, in principle, what applies to one category applies to the other. There has been great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and a generosity and willingness to come to the table to engage in discussion and find the pathway forward. The most positive aspect of this has been the willingness of all concerned to address the issues as they need to be addressed and to do so as expeditiously as possible. I appreciate the points made by previous speakers on the time span but it is our wish to bring this to a conclusion as soon as we possibly can.	spk_169
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	School Equipment	dbsect_29	Managing ventilation is just one of a suite of public health measures in place to keep our schools safe. Updated guidance on practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices in schools was provided at the end of May, following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing Covid-19. A copy of the guidance is published on the website  My Department procured portable monitors. They are currently being distributed to schools, with allocations of between two and 20 at primary school level and between 20 and 35 at post-primary school level, depending on school size, at an estimated overall cost of €4 million. The monitors are portable, simple to use and will give a digital reading. Deliveries of carbon dioxide monitors to schools commenced in the third week of August. In total, the process involves over 35,000 monitors being distributed to primary and post-primary schools. Some 25,000 carbon dioxide monitors have been distributed to schools, which has facilitated the provision of monitors to each school. Ninety-six percent of primary schools, including all special schools, have received their full allocation of carbon dioxide monitors. Ten monitors, at a minimum, have been provided to each school at post-primary level, with the balance of each allocation expected to be distributed in October. An issue arose with Lennox over the final balance of carbon dioxide monitors but provision has been made for them to arrive in schools in October. Schools have the autonomy to purchase carbon dioxide monitors locally if they wish and deem it necessary.	spk_171
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	School Equipment	dbsect_29	I thank the Deputy. There is international demand for carbon dioxide monitors. We ordered them more than four months ago. We are moving into the fifth month now. Ninety-six percent of our primary schools are in possession of their allocation of carbon dioxide monitors. All of our special schools have received their allocation, and all of our post-primary schools have a minimum of ten monitors. Complementing the guidance already available to schools — the excellent guidance on the operation of ventilation in our schools — it was suggested, through the expert group under Professor John Wenger, that the monitors be portable. The idea was that they could spot-check and be moved from room to room. We accepted that and therefore we ordered them centrally. Where there is a small shortfall, schools do have the autonomy to purchase locally. Where issues arise regarding ventilation in a school, whether they concern the need for improved vent or window work or otherwise, funding is available for that school through the minor works scheme. Alternatively, emergency funding applications can be made. If there are bigger issues, there is absolutely no question but that the expertise of the Department, be it in engineering or another area, can be availed of.If any additional measures are required to be put in place and have been done in other cases, we will continue to do that on a case-by-case basis also. There is no question of our sourcing and resourcing this area within our schools.	spk_173
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_30	I thank the Deputy for his question. The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the 2020-21 school year, more than 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over €224.7 million in 2020. All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time for the 2021-22 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. This year I have extended measures to all post-primary pupils who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school. Prior to this it was their nearest school but this year I have extended it to ensure that the second nearest school is also part of the framework. All those who have applied and paid on time will be accommodated on school transport services. This arrangement is in place for the current school year pending completion of the full review of the school transport scheme.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis and are offered seats where capacity exists after all eligible children have been catered for. Late applications or families who pay late or both are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats have been allocated to those who have applied and paid on time for services for the 2021-22 school year.  Planning for school transport for the 2021-22 school year has proceeded on the basis that the public health measures in place as schools closed at the end of the last school year would remain as term began in this new school year. This includes the recommendations from public health that post-primary services would operate at 50% capacity and that masks would be worn. However, as the vaccination programme for children on post-primary services is rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeds, the capacity limit of 50% on post-primary school transport services will be subject to ongoing review and the Department will be considering the position in this regard over the coming weeks. Bus Éireann has confirmed that to date, 104,324 pupils, including 54,728 post-primary eligible pupils and 14,735 post-primary concessionary pupils have been issued tickets for the school transport scheme. This number is changing as tickets continue to be allocated to pupils. In the region of 98% of all valid and paid-on-time applicants have been issued with a ticket.	spk_177
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_30	I thank the Deputy. I appreciate the issues being brought forward to constituency offices. I am a rural Deputy myself and I understand that and the importance of the school transport system. We have made significant progress in the past year in addressing many of the issues that were problematic last year. This has been helped in no small measure by the review that is in place and as a consequence of the decision I made to ensure that the second nearest school would also be part of the terms of agreement for access to school transport. The figures and the statistics speak for themselves, in that 98% of all valid and paid-on-time applicants have been issued with a ticket. That is a phenomenal figure to be able to discuss with the House here today. On specific cases that the Deputy might raise, there is always a mechanism where, if there is an exception for whatever reason, whether due to family circumstances not allowing payment on time or if something has happened, this can be reviewed.	spk_179
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-09-23	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_30	I thank the Deputies. I confirm, once again, that the planning for school transport for the 2021-22 school year has proceeded on the basis that the public health measures in place at schools closed at the end of last year would remain as term began in this new school year. This included the recommendation from public health that post-primary services would operate at 50% capacity and that masks would be worn. However, as we have said, as the vaccination programme for children and post-primary services have rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeds, the capacity limit of 50% on post-primary school transport services will now be subject to an ongoing review by the Department and that will be considered within the next number of weeks. I wish to acknowledge again that in the region of 98% of all valid and paid-on-time applicants have been issued a ticket. This is a significant percentage but as I have also already alluded to earlier, a further percentage change will happen because tickets are continuing to be issued. This is distinct progress on where we were in previous years.  I also note the comments of the Deputies in moving from 50% to 100% but this will be done on the back of public health advice and prudence for our students.	spk_185
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-07	dail	33	Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_15	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" I am pleased to be in a position to bring the Bill to the House. The Bill has been passed by the Seanad, where it received cross-party support. I believe this is important legislation as it seeks to provide a clear framework for schools in regard to engagement within their school communities and between home and school. As Members will be aware, a spirit of open communication and partnership is vital to the running of the school. At its very best, education extends well beyond the classroom and into the lives and homes of everyone within a school community, and this includes students, their families and, of course, staff. For a school community to reach its full potential, it requires the support of everyone involved. I know from my experience that many parents and staff give freely of their time and support to ensure their school community is able to reach its fullest potential. One such experience is the wonderful tradition in Ireland of volunteer-led boards of management, which contribute so much to the quality of education. Communication and engagement must be at the heart of how a school is run. I know many schools do this well and have positive and open communication within their school community. Those schools can attest to the positive benefit of engagement with students, parents and staff for the entire school community. This legislation will support all schools by providing a clear framework to guide them in establishing and implementing good practice. It will do so by amending the Education Act 1998. That Act sets out a clear framework for the operation and management of schools in Ireland. However, while the 1998 Act includes some provisions that can guide, aid and influence the relationship between a school and its staff, students and parents, it does not currently provide significant guidance as to how schools engage with staff, students and their parents on a proactive basis. While there are limited provisions within the Education Act as to communication with the parents and students, it is focused on creating procedures to process grievances or appeals once they have arisen. As important as this is, we must also take proactive measures to create a positive school environment. The approach being taken in this Bill is to shift away from concentrating on reacting to problems in schools after issues arise to an approach that aims to improve the day-to-day experience the school community can expect from schools. This will be done by setting out clearly a framework that schools will apply in their engagement with the school community. Under this framework, every school will be required to prepare, publish and implement a school community charter. This charter must adhere to national charter guidelines developed and published by the Minister. The charter guidelines will be developed in consultation with the education partners, including those organisations representing students and their parents. The consultation process will be an important element in ensuring that the guidelines achieve their objective in a manner that is straightforward and effective for students, parents and school staff. This Bill has 11 sections. Section 1 is a standard definitions section. Section 2 is the largest as it inserts four new sections, namely, sections 27A to 27D, inclusive, into the Education Act 1998. I will outline these new sections in more detail. Section 27A provides that a school board of management must prepare, publish and implement a charter in accordance with the Minister's charter guidelines. In preparing its charter, the board must consult with the patron, school principal, school staff, students, parents, the student council and the parents' association, and must prepare the charter in accordance with the charter guidelines. Each school charter must affirm that the charter has been prepared by the board in accordance and compliance with the charter guidelines. Section 27A prohibits a school board from including content in its charter that is not in accordance with, or provided for by, the charter guidelines. It also provides that the board must review and amend its charter as provided for by the charter guidelines. Section 27B requires the Minister to develop and put in place national charter guidelines. The guidelines must address,  Section 27B also provides that the charter guidelines in respect of the content of charters in schools may relate to the following matters: the procedures for consulting with students and their parents on such matters relating to the school as may be specified in the charter guidelines, including by inviting, and responding to, comments and suggestions from students and their parents on any such matter; and information on school plans and policies of the school, other than the admission policy, and the activities of the school. As the Admissions Act 2018 sets out a separate and comprehensive legal framework for the development, publication and implementation of schools' admission policy, the admission policy is excluded from this provision and similar provisions in the Bill. The section also provides for the procedures, including consultation procedures, for the preparation, review and updating of school plans and policies of the school, other than the admission policy, and the development, review and updating of the activities of the school; the procedures for informing students and their parents of matters relating to the operation and performance of the school; and the procedures for informing students and their parents of the activities of the school. Other charter content set out in section 27B includes information on the structures and systems for the management of the school; the information to be provided to students and their parents relating to moneys that the school receives, including voluntary contributions made by parents, and the expenditure of those moneys by the school, and of the form and manner in which that information is to be provided; the information to be provided to students and their parents relating to the school calendar, closures and timetables and of the form and manner in which that information is to be provided; and the procedures for dealing with grievances of students or their parents relating to the school, and details of aggregated and anonymised information to be provided to students and their parents relating to grievances dealt with by the school, which may include the number or type of such grievances and related outcomes, and the form and manner in which that information is to be provided. The section also provides that the guidelines may, where the Minister considers it necessary, include model charters for different categories of schools and contain different provisions for different categories of schools or different categories of students. Section 27C provides that the Minister, in preparing the charter guidelines, must have regard to certain matters that are specified in this section.These matters align with the core principles that were set out in the general scheme of the Bill. There are ten such matters listed from (a) to (j). These are the need for a school to:(a) seek to achieve, as far as practicable and subject to the resources available, the best possible outcomes for students in relation to their education and personal development,(b) foster and promote the relationship and a spirit of partnership between the school and students and their parents,(c) foster and promote mutual respect in communications between the school, including teachers or other staff of the school, on the one hand and students or their parents on the other hand,(d) ensure, as appropriate, confidentiality in communications referred to in paragraph (c),(e) promote the role and participation of parents in the education and personal development of students,(f) consult with, and encourage the participation and engagement of, students (to the extent appropriate to their age and experience) and their parents, and respond, as appropriate, to comments and suggestions made by students and their parents, in respect of the development, review and updating of school plans and policies of the school (other than the admission policy) and the activities of the school,(g) monitor and review the provision of education by the school to students, including by consulting with, and responding, as appropriate, to comments and suggestions made by, students (to the extent appropriate to their age and experience) and their parents, for the purposes of assessing and improving such provision on an ongoing basis,(h) foster and promote equality of access for students to, and participation by students in, education by seeking, as far as practicable, to reduce the costs to parents and students of such participation,(i) address and resolve concerns of students or their parents relating to the school, as far as possible, at an early stage, and(j) ensure that grievances of students or their parents relating to the school are dealt with efficiently, effectively and fairly and, as far as possible, in an informal manner consistent with the principles of fair procedures. The fourth new section, 27D, provides the Minister with a power to give a board of management a direction where he or she is of the opinion that the board has failed or is failing in whole or in part, to comply with its obligation to prepare, publish and implement a charter. Before issuing a direction, the Minister must give the board and school patron notice of his or her intention to give a direction, setting out the reasons and the proposed remedial action. The notice must offer the board and the patron, or both, an opportunity to make representations on the proposed direction and provide the board and patron with at least 14 days to do so. The board and the patron therefore have an opportunity to rectify the matter before a direction issues or to make representations on the proposed direction. The Minister must, in deciding whether or not to give a direction, consider any representations. Where the Minister proceeds to issue a direction, the board must comply with that direction. The Minister is also required to publish the direction on the Department's website no later than 14 days from the date of issue. The board must confirm in writing to the Minister when it has complied with the direction and the Minister, on being satisfied that a direction has been complied with, must publish a notice to that effect on the Department's website. The Minister must also give notice in writing to the board and the patron that he or she is satisfied that the direction has been complied with. I will move to the other sections of the Bill. Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 2 of the Act of 1998 by inserting definitions for ""charter"" and ""charter guidelines"". Section 4 provides for the amendment of section 9 of the Act of 1998. Section 9 of the Act of 1998 sets out the various statutory functions of a school. In line with the purpose and aims of this Bill, two new important functions of a school are being inserted by section 4. These are to promote the involvement of students and their parents in the provision of education to students, and to ensure the implementation of the charter. Section 5 provides for the amendment of section 20 of the Act of 1998. Section 20 currently refers to procedures for informing parents, but not students, of matters relating to the operation and performance of the school. It is being amended to link those procedures to the charter guidelines and to provide that both students and parents are referred to in the section. Section 6 provides for the amendment of section 21 of the Act of 1998. Section 21 of the Education Act 1998 concerns the school plan and is being amended to ensure that the arrangements for the preparation of a school plan referred to in that section must comply with any applicable charter guidelines in respect of same. Section 7 provides for the amendment of section 27 of the Act of 1998. Section 27(1) requires schools to have procedures for informing students about the activities of the school. It is being amended to ensure those procedures comply with any charter guidelines in respect of same and to provide that both students and parents are referred to in this provision. Section 7 also amends section 27(4) which concerns the role of a student council. The amendment changes the requirement of a student council from one of promoting the interest of the school to a requirement to promote the interest of the students of the school having regard to the characteristic spirit and policies of the school and the charter. Section 8 provides for replacement of the existing section 28 of the Act of 1998. The existing section 28 of the Education Act 1998 is replaced with a new section 28. The new section 28 is designed to work in tandem with the other charter-related provisions in the Bill. Together, these provisions will ensure that all schools will be required to have and to implement standardised grievance procedures that will be set out in the national charter guidelines following consultation with the education partners. This new section 28 provides that these grievance procedures must provide for matters such as: the requirements to be complied with by the school and the student or parent concerned in relation to the grievance process; the investigation of grievances in a manner appropriate to the nature of the grievance, whether by informal or formal means or both; the resolution of grievances, either formally or informally; the giving of reasons for its decisions on grievances; and the implementation of decisions and any remedial action required. Section 28(2) provides that a school may, in accordance with the charter guidelines, decide not to deal with the grievance where the grievance is, in the opinion of the school, vexatious or frivolous, and that the school shall give to the student or parent, as the case may be, the reasons for such a decision. Section 9 is a technical amendment and provides for the amendment of section 42 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 to update an existing reference in that Act to section 28 of the Education Act 1998, replacing it with reference to the grievance procedures provided for under this Bill. Similarly, section 10 provides for a technical amendment of section 9 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to update an existing reference in that Act to section 28 of the Education Act 1998, replacing it with a reference to the grievance procedures provided for in this Bill. The final section of the Bill, section 11, is a standard provision to provide for the Short Title, commencement and collective citation of the Education Acts. I have outlined the provisions of the Bill as passed by the Seanad. I will outline the amendments that I wish to make to the Bill as it progresses through the Dáil. I know that a school can only be at its best when the full engagement and inclusion of every student, parent and member of staff is involved. Since becoming Minister, I have pursued a partnership approach. I am especially pleased that the student voice has been an integral part of all stakeholder engagements in recent months. I believe in an inclusive, collaborative approach to education. I therefore advise the House that I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage to amend the Short Title of the Bill to the education (school community charter) Bill. The school community will be defined in the Bill as including students, parents and school staff. This amendment should help to reflect the importance of the role of the entire school community in the education of children and young people and to help ensure that the engagement and listening culture that the charter currently provides for is inclusive of the entire school community. Further amendments to the Bill will be necessary to replace references to students and parents with references to the school community. These amendments will ensure that school staff are included in the consultation process, which the charter provides for, and that they are provided with the same information that students and parents are provided with. I know that many stakeholders have expressed concerns that the Bill as it was initially presented was not fully inclusive of the entire school community. I hope that these changes address those concerns and demonstrate our commitment to ensuring that the Bill is inclusive of everyone in a school.It is not proposed that the national grievances procedures for parents and students as provided for by the charter guidelines would include school staff, as they are employees of the board of management and have separate grievance procedures. I also intend to bring another key amendment to the Bill in respect of section 9(2) of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. This amendment is proposed to ensure that the Bill does not impact on the current role and remit of the Ombudsman for Children in considering grievances from students and parents. The Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 currently provides in section 9(2) that the Ombudsman for Children may carry out an investigation under the Act in relation to its school only where the grievance procedures prescribed under section 28 of the Education Act have been resorted to and exhausted. Schools are the only body or organisation where there is an absolute bar on the Ombudsman for Children investigating until the local grievance processes have concluded. However, since no procedures have to date been prescribed under section 28 of the 1998 Act, in practical terms this provision is not operational and, therefore, the Act currently applies to schools in the same way it does to other bodies that can be investigated by the Ombudsman for Children. Without an amendment to this Bill this position would be changed. The Ombudsman for Children has advised that, in practice, the ombudsman would investigate complaints before the local process is exhausted only where the ombudsman has reason to believe that the local process has been deliberately frustrated or that an urgent risk is presented to a child or student. I want to ensure this position is maintained. My officials will engage with the ombudsman further regarding this amendment. In conclusion, I believe that this Bill is very important legislation. It will both positively and proactively enhance and improve the experience of the entire school community in our schools. I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies regarding the Bill."	spk_237
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	Departmental Schemes	dbsect_3	The school transport scheme is significant operation, managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the current school year, more than 114,000 children, including more than 14,700 children with special educational needs, SEN, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, at a cost of more than €224.7 million in 2020. All children who are eligible for school transport, and who complete the application and payment process on time, are accommodated in school transport services, where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only. They may be offered seats where capacity exists and after all eligible children have been catered for. The Department recently commenced a review of the school transport scheme. Following commencement of this review in February 2021, in a detailed analysis and a report conducted by the technical working group in the interim period, the steering group recently presented me with its initial interim report, a report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next-nearest school. Following consideration of this report, I have approved the recommendation to maintain the scheme as it currently operates, pending the outcome of the full review, but with temporary alleviation measures to continue on post-primary transport scheme services. These temporary alleviation measures allow for post-primary pupils who are otherwise eligible for school transport, but who are attending their second-nearest school, who apply and pay on time, to access school transport. This will result in transport being provided for an estimated additional 1,800 post-primary pupils in the 2021-2022 school year, who otherwise would not be accommodated under the scheme. This arrangement will be in place for the coming school year pending completion of the full review of the school transport scheme.  The Department has engaged intensively with Bus Éireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of school transport services for the 2020-2021 school year. Based on public health advice, the Department provided for school transport scheme services for the 2020-2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services, as required, to provide physical distancing using 50% of passenger capacity-----	spk_2
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	Departmental Schemes	dbsect_3	I am conscious of the issues the Deputy raises. As a consequence of that, he will be aware that there is a full review of the school transport system, which I have instigated. In the shortest term possible, we have asked for the interim report. The interim report looks at issues of eligibility in terms of nearest school and next-nearest school. I am pleased to say that in the short term, we have made those changes. There are many other changes and additions that will come on foot of the larger report, when it comes out. Concessionary tickets are available to children who are not eligible for school transport, because they are not attending their nearest school or because they reside less than the residency distance. Transport on a concessionary basis is subject to a number of conditions which are detailed in the school transport scheme, for example, the existence of spare seats on a bus, after all eligible children have been catered for and payment of the school transport charge, regardless of whether the child holds a medical card. As a consequence of the change was announced in 2011, the evidence is there that a growing number of children have availed of school transport on a concessionary basis since 2011, rising from 4,000 on 20 November 2012 to more than 30,000 in the 2019-2020 school year. This is an increase of more than 25,000. That will increase again as-----	spk_5
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	Departmental Schemes	dbsect_3	There will be additional 1,800.	spk_7
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	Departmental Schemes	dbsect_3	The Department is clear on ambition. We recognise there are considerable issues with school transport. A review of the entire school transport scheme is under way at this point in time. To facilitate accommodations that could be made in the short term, there was an announcement of an initial finding of review, which will now accommodate an additional 1,800 pupils. In this very short space of time, to be able to produce a report of that nature that facilitates students who wish to attend their second-nearest school is a welcome, progressive, positive and, indeed, proactive approach to take. I am conscious that the fuller report, when it is completed, will address many more issues. It will provide us with opportunities to amend and introduce new measures and accommodations. There is no shortage of ambition, as the Deputy refers to it. There is no shortage of determination to address the issues of school transport.	spk_9
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	Departmental Schemes	dbsect_3	As someone who comes from the school sector, I am keenly aware of the vital role played by school secretaries in the running of our schools. In recognition of this role, I have put special arrangements in place for the coming school year whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from Covid cannot work on the school premises. I have also extended the employee assistance service to all school staff including secretaries and caretakers. The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support these functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. On foot of a chairman’s note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, the Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019, and that a minimum hourly pay rate of €13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented and increased funding was provided by my Department. The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of €8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has, from 1 January 2019, been paid €13 per hour, which is a 50% increase in that individual’s hourly pay. Fórsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from the Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and school management bodies have been engaging with Fórsa on the claim. On 27 October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues.

I have been very clear on this. I am also very clear, as I am sure is the Deputy, that there is a process of engagement via the WRC. I also acknowledge that since October 2020 the process has moved apace and there has been significant engagement and meetings have been held between the parties under the auspices of the WRC. There have also been bilateral engagements in that regard. Therefore, there is a clear commitment to progress these complex issues that form part of the pay claim. I also acknowledge that detailed work is being carried out between the parties in phase 1 of the talks. To consider the remaining elements of the claim, further data are required. These data are now forthcoming as the Department recently completed a necessary data gathering process across the primary and post-primary sector. The returns from this exercise are now being analysed and this work will help to inform the next approaches to be taken regarding these issues.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	Departmental Schemes	dbsect_3	Many schools have a GP room or sports hall and practically all schools have outdoor play areas. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools. Investment and expenditure on GP rooms and PE halls is an element of the overall expenditure and investment in the school building programme. The provision of GP rooms, PE halls and outdoor hard play areas, such as basketball courts, form part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school. The main focus of resources over the past decade and for the coming period is on the provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics, particularly at post-primary level, and for special needs provision. Under the national development plan, NDP, increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme. This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities in post-primary schools. At present, this investment is targeted to the latter half of the NDP programme.  Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme, including in respect of Mayo, may be viewed on the Department's website, 	spk_18
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	Departmental Schemes	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy and appreciate the case he makes and the importance of the provision of these sorts of facilities in our schools. As I have previously outlined, they are part of funding via the NDP but we are looking towards the latter half of the timeframe of the plan for allocation. It is something of which I am conscious. I must also point out there is an enormous budgetary constraint in terms of provision. A GP room, for example, for a four-classroom primary school comes in at around €684,000. For an eight- to 16-classroom primary school, the cost is more than €900,00. A GP room for a 24-classroom primary school costs €1.8 million. A PE hall costs in excess of €3 million. I am conscious of the need, particularly from a health and fitness point of view and also on the basis of the additional resource that it provides to a school. I will do all that I can to advance that as quickly as possible, given the financial constraints we face.	spk_20
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	Departmental Schemes	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. I again say that I am wholly in agreement with him. I know from personal experience the importance of PE departments and all they achieve at second level. The provision of halls and a general purpose room at primary school level is important. The multipurpose nature of accommodations of that nature speaks to health and fitness while also allowing for enormous creative endeavour. It also facilitates school gatherings and events. There are enormous benefits. That is unquestionable. The commitment is there, as the Deputy has referenced, in the vision we have for schools, going forward. It would be my intention, if at all possible, to draw the funding sooner rather than when it is projected to be available. I will consider the Deputy's point about the provision of teachers specifically dedicated to the work of PE in primary school, going forward.	spk_22
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	The school transport scheme is significant operation, managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the current school year, more than 114,000 children, including more than 14,700 children with special educational needs, SEN, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, at a cost of more than €224.7 million in 2020. All children who are eligible for school transport, and who complete the application and payment process on time, are accommodated in school transport services, where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only. They may be offered seats where capacity exists and after all eligible children have been catered for. The Department recently commenced a review of the school transport scheme. Following commencement of this review in February 2021, in a detailed analysis and a report conducted by the technical working group in the interim period, the steering group recently presented me with its initial interim report, a report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next-nearest school. Following consideration of this report, I have approved the recommendation to maintain the scheme as it currently operates, pending the outcome of the full review, but with temporary alleviation measures to continue on post-primary transport scheme services. These temporary alleviation measures allow for post-primary pupils who are otherwise eligible for school transport, but who are attending their second-nearest school, who apply and pay on time, to access school transport. This will result in transport being provided for an estimated additional 1,800 post-primary pupils in the 2021-2022 school year, who otherwise would not be accommodated under the scheme. This arrangement will be in place for the coming school year pending completion of the full review of the school transport scheme.  The Department has engaged intensively with Bus Éireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of school transport services for the 2020-2021 school year. Based on public health advice, the Department provided for school transport scheme services for the 2020-2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services, as required, to provide physical distancing using 50% of passenger capacity-----	spk_2
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	I am conscious of the issues the Deputy raises. As a consequence of that, he will be aware that there is a full review of the school transport system, which I have instigated. In the shortest term possible, we have asked for the interim report. The interim report looks at issues of eligibility in terms of nearest school and next-nearest school. I am pleased to say that in the short term, we have made those changes. There are many other changes and additions that will come on foot of the larger report, when it comes out. Concessionary tickets are available to children who are not eligible for school transport, because they are not attending their nearest school or because they reside less than the residency distance. Transport on a concessionary basis is subject to a number of conditions which are detailed in the school transport scheme, for example, the existence of spare seats on a bus, after all eligible children have been catered for and payment of the school transport charge, regardless of whether the child holds a medical card. As a consequence of the change was announced in 2011, the evidence is there that a growing number of children have availed of school transport on a concessionary basis since 2011, rising from 4,000 on 20 November 2012 to more than 30,000 in the 2019-2020 school year. This is an increase of more than 25,000. That will increase again as-----	spk_5

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	The Department is clear on ambition. We recognise there are considerable issues with school transport. A review of the entire school transport scheme is under way at this point in time. To facilitate accommodations that could be made in the short term, there was an announcement of an initial finding of review, which will now accommodate an additional 1,800 pupils. In this very short space of time, to be able to produce a report of that nature that facilitates students who wish to attend their second-nearest school is a welcome, progressive, positive and, indeed, proactive approach to take. I am conscious that the fuller report, when it is completed, will address many more issues. It will provide us with opportunities to amend and introduce new measures and accommodations. There is no shortage of ambition, as the Deputy refers to it. There is no shortage of determination to address the issues of school transport.	spk_9
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_5	As someone who comes from the school sector, I am keenly aware of the vital role played by school secretaries in the running of our schools. In recognition of this role, I have put special arrangements in place for the coming school year whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from Covid cannot work on the school premises. I have also extended the employee assistance service to all school staff including secretaries and caretakers. The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support these functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. On foot of a chairman’s note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, the Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019, and that a minimum hourly pay rate of €13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented and increased funding was provided by my Department. The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of €8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has, from 1 January 2019, been paid €13 per hour, which is a 50% increase in that individual’s hourly pay. Fórsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from the Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and school management bodies have been engaging with Fórsa on the claim. On 27 October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. The parties continue to engage under the auspices of the WRC with the next meeting scheduled for 30 July and I support at all times meaningful engagement on this issue by all parties.	spk_11

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under the Department’s design and build programme. I want to be clear that this project is a priority for the Department. The permanent location for the school will be on a greenfield site in the Department’s ownership at Maryborough, Douglas, Cork. The school when complete will provide accommodation for 600 pupils and a special education needs unit with three classrooms. The timeline for the delivery of this project has been impacted by difficulties in obtaining planning permission. An application for planning permission was previously refused by the local authority. The Department appealed this decision to An Bord Pleanála but it was upheld. Due to a change in the local government boundary arrangements in Cork, the site for this Douglas ETSS is now within the environs of Cork City Council. In that regard, the Department has engaged with the council in advance of a new application for planning permission that can take account of concerns raised about traffic management. A pre-planning meeting was held on 16 April with Cork City Council. The Department’s project manager is actively working with Cork City Council's roads department to agree various traffic requirements in advance of lodging the planning application. A planning consultant has also been appointed to assist in the planning process and it is anticipated that the planning application will be lodged in quarter 3 of 2021.  It is not possible to provide a timeframe for the progression of the project to tender and construction stages until such time as the necessary statutory approvals have been secured. The Department will continue to address the interim accommodation requirements for the school and keep the patron body and school updated regarding the progress of the application. The Deputy will be familiar with this matter and I am sure he will appreciate that there was an issue with the original application for planning permission. However, the determination, tenacity and focus of the Department in this regard is demonstrated by the fact that we are moving towards a second application.	spk_30
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	I appreciate the points the Deputy has made, especially the point regarding the students who have moved through the years. I understand the impact on the entire school community, including the staff of the school, the board of management, the parents and, as I said, the students themselves. The Deputy will also appreciate, however, that, as with any application for planning permission, there is always the risk of refusal. In this case, the planning application was made and, unfortunately, that was the outcome. To reduce the associated risks the Department has engaged the services of a planning consultant to assist with the planning process. Discussions have also taken place with the planners and engineers of Cork City Council, which is important, and also with representatives of the roads and transport division of the council, which is significant as that is where there is an issue. A formal pre-planning meeting has also taken place. The application will aim to address any concerns raised by the previous refusal of planning permission by Cork County Council and we are moving this forward at pace.	spk_32
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	I appreciate the Deputy's genuine interest in this issue and the necessity to advance this project as quickly as possible.I can confirm that we are doing all we can. Certainly we hit a block in terms of the planning but we have reconfigured and reassessed and are doing all we can to ensure the next application will succeed.  I appreciate the points made by the Deputy. The Department has also approved the rental of additional rooms to provide sufficient accommodation for the 2021-22 academic year and is continuing to work with the patron body. I can confirm to the Deputy that there will be sufficient interim accommodation for September 2021.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to all students because of school closures arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. Yesterday, following a meeting of the advisory group on planning for State examinations, I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 leaving certificate examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied to the assessment arrangements for leaving certificate examinations 2021, as announced in December 2020. I also announced that the State Examinations Commission, SEC, will run an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations in 2022 shortly following the main set of examinations. The Deputy will also be aware that a review of Ireland's senior cycle is under way. I recognise that while the present senior cycle has its strengths, it also has a number of shortcomings that must be addressed. In this regard, I believe we must examine key issues at senior cycle delivery such as the timing of assessments and assessment components and broader issues of curriculum. I am committed to the review of the senior cycle.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has undertaken an extensive review of senior cycle programmes and vocational pathways. It is important to highlight that this goes beyond the established leaving certificate but includes transition year, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme. The NCCA has recently submitted the senior cycle review advisory report to the Department. The advisory report is being considered at the moment and will be published in due course. This work will be advanced as quickly as possible. 	spk_36
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	As the Deputy is aware, I am very conscious of the time lost in terms of in-person teaching and learning for the class of 2022. I acknowledge the work of the advisory group. When I reference the advisory group, I want to be clear about who is involved in that. As the students, parents, teachers, joint managerial bodies and the Department are at the heart of that, it is a representative and rounded group of people who have engaged over a long time to address a variety of issues - in this instance, making provision for the leaving certificate of 2022. The accommodations that have been announced take account of that loss of in-person teaching and learning. The conclusion of that process took place yesterday. It is my intention that the detail in that regard will be sent to the schools as a matter of priority. It will be there in a very short space of time.	spk_38
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	I am deeply conscious of the ongoing work in our schools throughout the pandemic. The Deputy will appreciate that the situation is always in flux for both the education sector and society as we deal with the pandemic. Notwithstanding that, considerable planning has gone into provision not just for this year but for the new school year as it begins in September. Schools have already been informed that all provisions in terms of PPE, hand sanitiser and other mitigation measures required for schools in September will be in place and provided for by the Department, as they were previously. We engage with public health on an ongoing basis every step of the way and should there be any additional requirements, they will be put in place and provided for and resourced by the Department.	spk_40
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	The policy of my Department is to support the use of school premises and facilities for community and recreational purposes where possible. In October 2017, following consultation with the relevant school authorities, my Department published guidelines on the use of school buildings outside of school hours. These guidelines can be viewed on my Department's website. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide guidance for schools relating to the use of school buildings outside of school hours and for those schools that are considering putting such arrangements in place. Any decision to make school facilities available lies with the relevant trustees or property owners having regard to the requirements of the school, staff and students. Schools are often the centre of sustainable communities and there can be mutual benefits in building links with the local community. Many schools recognise this and play an important role in their wider communities and many schools make their facilities available outside of school hours for a variety of different uses at a variety of different times throughout the year. During the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, a school in considering applications should carry out a risk assessment to ensure that any organisation intending to use the school's facilities can guarantee the school that all public health requirements will be adhered to. This is something of which we are particularly conscious as we journey through the Covid-19 pandemic. I want to acknowledge that in the vast majority of schools there is a very strong alignment between local communities and local schools. I acknowledge that for many communities the school is at the heart and very centre of many community activities as they operate within a local community. That is something I would welcome. It is important that schools within communities continue to build, grow and nurture links.	spk_42
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	I thank the Deputy. I appreciate the sincerity with which he has put forward his views. I want to confirm that the Department has no issue with schools making arrangements with local communities, provided that does not in any way impinge upon the needs of the school at any given time. Therefore, it is important that negotiations around that are at a local level and, as I have outlined, with the property owners, trustees or whatever the case might be. To be fair, and to the credit of schools across the country, an extraordinarily high number of schools are willing to do that and have engaged positively and proactively with local communities to ensure there is a sharing of resources that might be in the ownership of the school. As I said, specific guidelines are available to schools which might wish to consider doing that in the future.	spk_44
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	I thank the Deputy. I acknowledge that we are not too far apart in what he is saying. I want to acknowledge that the Department has no issue. As we previously outlined, it has made guidelines available as to how best practice would work in terms of ensuring how this would operate. As I said, I want to be clear because I do not want the impression to go abroad that this is not happening with school communities. I am aware of an enormous number of schools which are making their facilities available for a variety of different functions, gatherings, meetings or whatever initiatives might be required within a local community. I reiterate that is very positive. As the Deputy said, there are considerations from a school's point of view. Obviously, we would want to build and nurture links with communities. Many schools have already achieved that. We welcome other schools taking on board what needs to be taken on board so those that wish to create links can do so.	spk_46
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	Under the memorandum of understanding in place between local authorities and my Department in respect of the acquisition of suitable sites for schools, officials in my Department continue to liaise with officials in Cork City Council in regard to a site for the school, Le Chéile, in respect of which the Deputy is inquiring. A number of site options have been identified and assessed by my Department in conjunction with officials from Cork City Council. Unfortunately, in the case of most of these options the land could not be acquired from the landowner or the site was ultimately considered unfeasible to develop for a variety of technical reasons. However, two potential site options have been identified and negotiations are currently under way. These site options include potential campus arrangements with Gaelscoil An Chaisleáin. There is ongoing active engagement with Cork City Council, including with its planners in the context of the ongoing development plan review process. This consists of a number of communications via phone calls, email and conference calls specifically in regard to advancing this. I appreciate that the process is taking a considerable length of time but I can assure the Deputy that the acquisition of a suitable site for the school is very active in the programme of site acquisitions and every effort is being made to secure a suitable site for the school as expeditiously as possible. I know this is a high priority for the Deputy. He has continued to engage on an ongoing basis on this and I assure him we wish to expedite this as quickly as we possibly can.

I want to be very clear that the Department is doing all it can to engage with all sides to ensure we can expedite the provision of an appropriate site for all concerned as quickly as possible. In regard to Cork City Council, I want to acknowledge that there has been excellent and ongoing engagement between the Department of Education and the local authority and I want to acknowledge the manner in which it was facilitated by the local authority.

There have been ongoing and protracted engagements in an attempt to advance this as quickly as possible. It is a positive that we can say that two potential sites have been identified and that the negotiations are under way. The Deputy is correct that the site options include potential campus arrangements. It would be early days to say any more than that at this stage.

The Deputy will be aware that the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 completed all Stages of the Seanad in 2019. I confirm that the Department is currently awaiting an Order for Second Stage in the Dáil, at which time the Bill will be read a Second Time and continue through the legislative process. I would like to see that happen as quickly as possible. It is a key priority for the Department, given the Bill's potential to enhance school relations and communications. I support the overall aim of this legislation, which is to improve the level of engagement between the school community by inviting feedback, comment and observations from students and parents and by further developing a listening culture in our schools and stronger liaison within school communities. The legislation will help ensure that schools, students and parents continue to work in partnership effectively together and will provide greater clarity for students and their parents on what they can expect from schools. One of the key concepts of the Bill is the need for a school to consult with students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities. The detail on the manner in which schools will consult with, seek feedback from and respond to students and their parents will be set out in the charter guidelines, to be published following consultation with education stakeholders. Once the legislation is enacted, detailed work will be undertaken on developing the national charter guidelines in consultation with the education partners. The consultation process will be an important element in ensuring that the guidelines achieve their objective in a manner that is as straightforward and effective as possible, both for schools and for students and their parents. My officials within the Department will continue to work on progressing this important legislation.	spk_54

As the Deputy has referenced the pandemic, we have seen extraordinary examples of that working so well and significantly to facilitate schools and school communities to journey through the pandemic. From my experience I know that a school community is strongest when it works together and when all voices are at the table. I want to give the Deputy an absolute commitment that it is a key priority for my Department and for myself to move this as quickly as we possibly can.

I am conscious of the importance of in-person teaching and learning. I am also conscious of the need to make provision for supports for the new school year and that is a priority.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	As Deputy Smyth may be aware, an investment programme of €210 million has been delivered under the current Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020. As the Deputy's previous question demonstrated, there undoubtedly is a strong role for digital devices and the use of digital technology in teaching and learning within our education system, and we must support its continued development. Under the digital strategy, ICT funding is issued directly to schools as they are best placed to identify and meet the requirements of their school and school cohort. This funding can be used to buy devices for use by students and teachers, including learning platforms, software and the overall ICT infrastructure development in the school. Extensive support for schools to develop digital learning plans is provided through the digital learning framework alongside a suite of teacher professional learning delivered through the Department-funded teacher support service, the professional development service for teachers. Earlier this year, I announced the development of a new digital strategy for schools accompanied by a wide-ranging consultation process. A consultative group has also been established comprising all key stakeholders, that is, the widest possible reach within the education sector, including education partners, parent groups and student representatives to ensure a meaningful and effective engagement with all key stakeholders. In addition, consultation is under way as part of the process. I want the new strategy to build on the progress achieved to date and to ensure that young people gain the necessary digital skills as part of their education. The new strategy will take account of the findings from the consultation process, the experience gained through the implementation of the current strategy and national and international experience in this area. It also will seek to address and incorporate new and emerging issues and trends in digital technology in education. I look forward to working towards a new digital strategy for our schools in the coming months on the back of all this consultation.	spk_68
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	I agree with the Deputy that we have learned an enormous amount from the pandemic as we have gone through it. We have also learned of the flexibility, adaptability and resilience of schools in meeting challenges as they are presented. I want to be very clear that with the resourcing of schools, more than €100 million has been made available to them during the pandemic, specifically with regard to digital technology, and this afforded schools the opportunity to purchase equipment and loan equipment to students where necessary. I have seen good practice in many schools where it was not possible for a student to have equipment that the required equipment was loaned and students could draw on that resource. The Deputy referred to who would be involved with the consultation, etc. I have indicated that this was an open call consultation and it is important that the voices of students, parents, teachers, managerial bodies and wider society is heard. It is important as there is no monopoly of wisdom in any subject. The consultation process included and was open to everyone.	spk_70
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	I confirm that the consultation process was wide and provided online and questionnaire resources etc. There was an opportunity for people to engage and much of that is being analysed now. There have been and will continue to be bilateral engagements with a variety of different stakeholders and partners in education on the formulation of a new policy. It is my intention that we will be in a position to launch this new policy within the next number of months. I am under no illusions about the significant and beneficial resource that digital technology provides to our schools and, as I said, we have seen that during the pandemic. I acknowledge that digital technology is an additional tool within schools. We have also learned through this pandemic the value of in-person experiences in education as well. We are looking to broaden the resources we have in education and this is a vital example. We hope to be in a position to launch the new strategy in the coming months.	spk_72
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	As I have said, the Department and I, as Minister for Education, are acutely aware of the disruption caused to all students as a result of school closures arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. From 11 January 2021, all students engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools and I express appreciation to schools for managing that. Students who have just completed fifth year and who are due to take leaving certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning. In these circumstances, it was considered that some level of adjustment to the normal leaving certificate assessment arrangements should be made for them that would be proportionate to their experience and be educationally appropriate. Given where these students were at in their studies at the time of each school lockdown period, the impact of the loss of tuition time is less than that experienced by those students who sat the leaving certificate this year. To be fair to the class of 2022, there has been a loss of in-person teaching and learning. I am pleased to say that yesterday, the advisory group on planning for State examinations received an update on the 2022 leaving certificate and junior cycle examinations. I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 leaving certificate examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied by the assessment arrangements for leaving certificate examinations for 2021, as set in December 2020. These arrangements were announced before the second period of school closures. Additional changes will be made to that document to reflect syllabus content specific the 2022 examinations. The revised document will be published later this month. I also announced yesterday that the SEC will run an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations. The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, Covid-19 illness etc. during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness to be clearly and strictly delineated. The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice, which is a key priority. There will be further engagement with stakeholders in this matter.	spk_74
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	It is important to acknowledge there has been a considerable amount of forward planning by the Department in preparing for the 2022 leaving certificate. I acknowledge the contribution of the advisory group, as I outlined, which is representative of students, parents, teachers, managerial bodies and the wider spectrum of education partners. It is positive that we can now indicate to students what will be before them as they return to school at the end of August and early September. Advance notice is important not just to students but to teachers as well. We are constantly engaging with public health officials about mitigation measures and the operation of our schools. That engagement continues and any mitigation measures required, as I indicated earlier, are being and will be put in place. As I have said, we have made provision for a second running of leaving certificate examinations for the 2022 cohort. That is very important and students should be aware that the provision is there for them.	spk_76
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_8	To be fair to all who have engaged in this process, we were in a position yesterday, at the end of June, to make an announcement regarding forward planning for the class of 2022, which includes accommodation in terms of the exam. It is proportionate. It is the accommodation that was made available originally in August, with a further modification in December in terms of the assessment of the exam. We have gone a step further in June by announcing to students in advance of June 2022 that we are in a position and it is our intention to run a second diet or operation of leaving certificate 2022 to accommodate and make way for students who might, unfortunately, suffer a bereavement, an illness, an impact brought on by Covid-19 or whatever other issue might arise in that context. There has been considerable planning. Obviously, we keep everything under review and we engage with public health. It is a significant achievement that we are in a position to make this announcement one year in advance for the benefit of students.	spk_78
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_9	The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under the Department’s design and build programme. I want to be clear that this project is a priority for the Department. The permanent location for the school will be on a greenfield site in the Department’s ownership at Maryborough, Douglas, Cork. The school when complete will provide accommodation for 600 pupils and a special education needs unit with three classrooms. The timeline for the delivery of this project has been impacted by difficulties in obtaining planning permission. An application for planning permission was previously refused by the local authority. The Department appealed this decision to An Bord Pleanála but it was upheld. Due to a change in the local government boundary arrangements in Cork, the site for this Douglas ETSS is now within the environs of Cork City Council. In that regard, the Department has engaged with the council in advance of a new application for planning permission that can take account of concerns raised about traffic management. A pre-planning meeting was held on 16 April with Cork City Council. The Department’s project manager is actively working with Cork City Council's roads department to agree various traffic requirements in advance of lodging the planning application. A planning consultant has also been appointed to assist in the planning process and it is anticipated that the planning application will be lodged in quarter 3 of 2021.  It is not possible to provide a timeframe for the progression of the project to tender and construction stages until such time as the necessary statutory approvals have been secured. The Department will continue to address the interim accommodation requirements for the school and keep the patron body and school updated regarding the progress of the application. The Deputy will be familiar with this matter and I am sure he will appreciate that there was an issue with the original application for planning permission. However, the determination, tenacity and focus of the Department in this regard is demonstrated by the fact that we are moving towards a second application.	spk_30
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_9	I appreciate the points the Deputy has made, especially the point regarding the students who have moved through the years. I understand the impact on the entire school community, including the staff of the school, the board of management, the parents and, as I said, the students themselves. The Deputy will also appreciate, however, that, as with any application for planning permission, there is always the risk of refusal. In this case, the planning application was made and, unfortunately, that was the outcome. To reduce the associated risks the Department has engaged the services of a planning consultant to assist with the planning process. Discussions have also taken place with the planners and engineers of Cork City Council, which is important, and also with representatives of the roads and transport division of the council, which is significant as that is where there is an issue. A formal pre-planning meeting has also taken place. The application will aim to address any concerns raised by the previous refusal of planning permission by Cork County Council and we are moving this forward at pace.	spk_32
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_9	I appreciate the Deputy's genuine interest in this issue and the necessity to advance this project as quickly as possible.I can confirm that we are doing all we can. Certainly we hit a block in terms of the planning but we have reconfigured and reassessed and are doing all we can to ensure the next application will succeed.  I appreciate the points made by the Deputy. The Department has also approved the rental of additional rooms to provide sufficient accommodation for the 2021-22 academic year and is continuing to work with the patron body. I can confirm to the Deputy that there will be sufficient interim accommodation for September 2021. I appreciate the urgency of it and we are very cognisant of the importance of advancing this as quickly as possible. 	spk_34
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_10	My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to all students because of school closures arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. Yesterday, following a meeting of the advisory group on planning for State examinations, I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 leaving certificate examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied to the assessment arrangements for leaving certificate examinations 2021, as announced in December 2020. I also announced that the State Examinations Commission, SEC, will run an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations in 2022 shortly following the main set of examinations. The Deputy will also be aware that a review of Ireland's senior cycle is under way. I recognise that while the present senior cycle has its strengths, it also has a number of shortcomings that must be addressed. In this regard, I believe we must examine key issues at senior cycle delivery such as the timing of assessments and assessment components and broader issues of curriculum. I am committed to the review of the senior cycle.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has undertaken an extensive review of senior cycle programmes and vocational pathways. It is important to highlight that this goes beyond the established leaving certificate but includes transition year, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme. The NCCA has recently submitted the senior cycle review advisory report to the Department. The advisory report is being considered at the moment and will be published in due course. This work will be advanced as quickly as possible. 	spk_36
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_10	As the Deputy is aware, I am very conscious of the time lost in terms of in-person teaching and learning for the class of 2022. I acknowledge the work of the advisory group. When I reference the advisory group, I want to be clear about who is involved in that. As the students, parents, teachers, joint managerial bodies and the Department are at the heart of that, it is a representative and rounded group of people who have engaged over a long time to address a variety of issues - in this instance, making provision for the leaving certificate of 2022. The accommodations that have been announced take account of that loss of in-person teaching and learning. The conclusion of that process took place yesterday. It is my intention that the detail in that regard will be sent to the schools as a matter of priority. It will be there in a very short space of time.	spk_38
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_10	I am deeply conscious of the ongoing work in our schools throughout the pandemic. The Deputy will appreciate that the situation is always in flux for both the education sector and society as we deal with the pandemic. Notwithstanding that, considerable planning has gone into provision not just for this year but for the new school year as it begins in September. Schools have already been informed that all provisions in terms of PPE, hand sanitiser and other mitigation measures required for schools in September will be in place and provided for by the Department, as they were previously. We engage with public health on an ongoing basis every step of the way and should there be any additional requirements, they will be put in place and provided for and resourced by the Department.	spk_40
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_11	The policy of my Department is to support the use of school premises and facilities for community and recreational purposes where possible. In October 2017, following consultation with the relevant school authorities, my Department published guidelines on the use of school buildings outside of school hours. These guidelines can be viewed on my Department's website. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide guidance for schools relating to the use of school buildings outside of school hours and for those schools that are considering putting such arrangements in place. Any decision to make school facilities available lies with the relevant trustees or property owners having regard to the requirements of the school, staff and students. Schools are often the centre of sustainable communities and there can be mutual benefits in building links with the local community. Many schools recognise this and play an important role in their wider communities and many schools make their facilities available outside of school hours for a variety of different uses at a variety of different times throughout the year. During the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, a school in considering applications should carry out a risk assessment to ensure that any organisation intending to use the school's facilities can guarantee the school that all public health requirements will be adhered to. This is something of which we are particularly conscious as we journey through the Covid-19 pandemic. I want to acknowledge that in the vast majority of schools there is a very strong alignment between local communities and local schools. I acknowledge that for many communities the school is at the heart and very centre of many community activities as they operate within a local community. That is something I would welcome. It is important that schools within communities continue to build, grow and nurture links.	spk_42
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_11	I thank the Deputy. I appreciate the sincerity with which he has put forward his views. I want to confirm that the Department has no issue with schools making arrangements with local communities, provided that does not in any way impinge upon the needs of the school at any given time. Therefore, it is important that negotiations around that are at a local level and, as I have outlined, with the property owners, trustees or whatever the case might be. To be fair, and to the credit of schools across the country, an extraordinarily high number of schools are willing to do that and have engaged positively and proactively with local communities to ensure there is a sharing of resources that might be in the ownership of the school. As I said, specific guidelines are available to schools which might wish to consider doing that in the future.	spk_44
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Facilities	dbsect_11	I thank the Deputy. I acknowledge that we are not too far apart in what he is saying. I want to acknowledge that the Department has no issue. As we previously outlined, it has made guidelines available as to how best practice would work in terms of ensuring how this would operate. As I said, I want to be clear because I do not want the impression to go abroad that this is not happening with school communities. I am aware of an enormous number of schools which are making their facilities available for a variety of different functions, gatherings, meetings or whatever initiatives might be required within a local community. I reiterate that is very positive. As the Deputy said, there are considerations from a school's point of view. Obviously, we would want to build and nurture links with communities. Many schools have already achieved that. We welcome other schools taking on board what needs to be taken on board so those that wish to create links can do so.	spk_46
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_12	Under the memorandum of understanding in place between local authorities and my Department in respect of the acquisition of suitable sites for schools, officials in my Department continue to liaise with officials in Cork City Council in regard to a site for the school, Le Chéile, in respect of which the Deputy is inquiring. A number of site options have been identified and assessed by my Department in conjunction with officials from Cork City Council. Unfortunately, in the case of most of these options the land could not be acquired from the landowner or the site was ultimately considered unfeasible to develop for a variety of technical reasons. However, two potential site options have been identified and negotiations are currently under way. These site options include potential campus arrangements with Gaelscoil An Chaisleáin. There is ongoing active engagement with Cork City Council, including with its planners in the context of the ongoing development plan review process. This consists of a number of communications via phone calls, email and conference calls specifically in regard to advancing this. I appreciate that the process is taking a considerable length of time but I can assure the Deputy that the acquisition of a suitable site for the school is very active in the programme of site acquisitions and every effort is being made to secure a suitable site for the school as expeditiously as possible. I know this is a high priority for the Deputy. He has continued to engage on an ongoing basis on this and I assure him we wish to expedite this as quickly as we possibly can.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	School Equipment	dbsect_15	I confirm that the consultation process was wide and provided online and questionnaire resources etc. There was an opportunity for people to engage and much of that is being analysed now. There have been and will continue to be bilateral engagements with a variety of different stakeholders and partners in education on the formulation of a new policy. It is my intention that we will be in a position to launch this new policy within the next number of months. I am under no illusions about the significant and beneficial resource that digital technology provides to our schools and, as I said, we have seen that during the pandemic. I acknowledge that digital technology is an additional tool within schools. We have also learned through this pandemic the value of in-person experiences in education as well. We are looking to broaden the resources we have in education and this is a vital example. We hope to be in a position to launch the new strategy in the coming months.	spk_72
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_16	As I have said, the Department and I, as Minister for Education, are acutely aware of the disruption caused to all students as a result of school closures arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. From 11 January 2021, all students engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools and I express appreciation to schools for managing that. Students who have just completed fifth year and who are due to take leaving certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning. In these circumstances, it was considered that some level of adjustment to the normal leaving certificate assessment arrangements should be made for them that would be proportionate to their experience and be educationally appropriate. Given where these students were at in their studies at the time of each school lockdown period, the impact of the loss of tuition time is less than that experienced by those students who sat the leaving certificate this year. To be fair to the class of 2022, there has been a loss of in-person teaching and learning. I am pleased to say that yesterday, the advisory group on planning for State examinations received an update on the 2022 leaving certificate and junior cycle examinations. I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 leaving certificate examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied by the assessment arrangements for leaving certificate examinations for 2021, as set in December 2020. These arrangements were announced before the second period of school closures. Additional changes will be made to that document to reflect syllabus content specific the 2022 examinations. The revised document will be published later this month. I also announced yesterday that the SEC will run an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations. The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, Covid-19 illness etc. during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness to be clearly and strictly delineated. The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice, which is a key priority. There will be further engagement with stakeholders in this matter.	spk_74

I acknowledge the contribution of the advisory group, as I outlined, which is representative of students, parents, teachers, managerial bodies and the wider spectrum of education partners. It is positive that we can now indicate to students what will be before them as they return to school at the end of August and early September. Advance notice is important not just to students but to teachers as well. We are constantly engaging with public health officials about mitigation measures and the operation of our schools. That engagement continues and any mitigation measures required, as I indicated earlier, are being and will be put in place. As I have said, we have made provision for a second running of leaving certificate examinations for the 2022 cohort. That is very important and students should be aware that the provision is there for them.	spk_76
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_16	To be fair to all who have engaged in this process, we were in a position yesterday, at the end of June, to make an announcement regarding forward planning for the class of 2022, which includes accommodation in terms of the exam. It is proportionate. It is the accommodation that was made available originally in August, with a further modification in December in terms of the assessment of the exam. We have gone a step further in June by announcing to students in advance of June 2022 that we are in a position and it is our intention to run a second diet or operation of leaving certificate 2022 to accommodate and make way for students who might, unfortunately, suffer a bereavement, an illness, an impact brought on by Covid-19 or whatever other issue might arise in that context. There has been considerable planning. Obviously, we keep everything under review and we engage with public health. It is a significant achievement that we are in a position to make this announcement one year in advance for the benefit of students.	spk_78
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 [Seanad]: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_40	I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on this vitally important Bill. At the heart of it is the underlying principle that we must strive for an education that enriches, values and nurtures every child and young person within it.The Government will be supporting this Bill. I am acutely aware of the power of education and specifically the power that it has in not only shaping the lives of students, but in shaping the outlooks of future generations. We must always strive for a better education system, one which best meets the needs of all the students within it.  In recent decades, progress has been made in creating an education system that is more inclusive and supportive, including for Traveller children and young people. This being said, I recognise that much remains to be done and the sheer fact of this Bill being brought before the House today highlights this. As Deputies will undoubtedly be aware, this is borne out by some of the statistics surrounding Traveller children and young people in education. For example, just 13.3% of Traveller females were educated to upper secondary or above compared with 69.1% of the general population. Nearly six in ten Traveller men were educated to primary level at the highest. This is in sharp contrast to the general population, for which the comparable rate is just over one in ten. Clearly, we must do more to ensure that Traveller children and young people feel their experience and perspective is fully and equally valued by the education system so that this system provides opportunity for them to reach their fullest potential.  Since the Bill was first introduced in the Seanad, a considerable body of work has been progressed by the Department of Education in order to further this shared objective. One of the first undertakings was for the National Council on Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, the Government's advisory body on curriculum and assessment, to complete an audit of current curricular provision on Traveller culture and history in our education system. This audit was completed and subsequently published.  The audit identified a number of means through which students’ understanding of Traveller history and culture can be advanced through the present curriculum across primary and post-primary levels. For example, throughout primary school, subjects such as history offer an opportunity for students to learn more about the lives of men, women and children from different social, cultural and ethnic backgrounds through Ireland’s past. Through the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum, students can be encouraged and supported in developing a greater understanding and appreciation of Ireland’s diverse communities. At post-primary level, there are also opportunities for students to develop a greater awareness of Traveller culture and education. For example, at junior cycle, schools have the autonomy to develop programmes of study that help students to develop a greater appreciation of how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to our communities and to understand how historic events have shaped contemporary society.  In considering the question of current provision, we must be careful to examine not only the curriculum as it exists on paper, but to look carefully at practices across our school system, as has been alluded to, and to examine not only whether these topics are being taught, but how they are being taught. While this work has admittedly and regrettably been slowed by the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has reduced the NCCA's ability to go into schools and learn from students and teachers, it remains ongoing. It has been further supported by the appointment of a full-time education officer in the NCCA in September 2020. This officer is leading on this work and engaging with education centres from preschool to post-primary. A first draft of the NCCA’s research paper on Traveller history and culture should be ready to present to NCCA boards and council in the fourth quarter of this year. From September 2021, public health guidelines allowing, further work on gathering examples of practice from across early years, primary and post-primary settings will begin. I look forward to the receipt of this research paper and to considering the next steps which arise from it.  In this regard, it would be remiss of me to fail to acknowledge some of the very positive work which has taken place and continues to take place within the education system to promote and support Traveller culture and integration. Much of the NCCA’s work over the coming months will be in visiting schools and other education settings to learn more about work that is already happening to promote awareness and respect of Traveller culture and history and to identify best practice for future policy development.  The question of improving Traveller outcomes and experiences in education cannot be answered by curricular change alone, as has also been alluded to previously. This change must be bolstered by further positive actions to ensure that the Irish education system and broader society is a welcoming and supportive environment for Traveller children and young people. The national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS, provides the framework and strategic direction for interventions across a range of Departments to support the additional needs of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland in practical and tangible ways. It contains 149 actions across ten distinctive themes. There are a number of very significant actions for the Department of Education in this strategy, including the development of education resources on Traveller and Roma culture and history for use in primary, post-primary and adult education settings; achieving improved access, participation and outcomes for Travellers and Roma in education to achieve outcomes that are equal to those of the majority population; and fostering a positive culture of respect and protection for the cultural identity of Travellers and Roma across the education system. I am pleased to note that there are a number of areas under this strategy in which significant progress has already been made. For example, one of the commitments under this strategy was to address potential discrimination in education by reviewing policy on admissions to school and addressing issues including the publication of school enrolment policies, the ending of waiting lists, the introduction of annual enrolment structures and ensuring transparency and fairness in admissions for pupils and their parents. The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 was passed by the Oireachtas on 4 July 2018. Further to the commencement of a number of sections of this Act, all schools have drafted new admissions policies, which seek to create a consistent and equitable approach to how school admissions are operated for primary and post-primary schools. I am pleased to note that the operation of these policies has now commenced and have governed the admissions of students to primary and post-primary school for September 2021 enrolment.  Another very significant body of work being undertaken by my Department is the NTRIS education pilot, which has been established to improve school participation for Traveller children and young people. This pilot project serves four areas across the country within Dublin, Galway, Wexford and Cork, supporting approximately 50 school communities. In each of these four pilot areas, additional staffing resources have been provided comprising an additional educational welfare officer and an additional home-school liaison co-ordinator, funded by the Department of Education, and two Traveller and Roma education workers, employed by local Traveller and Roma support groups through the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. These staff work together with schools and their staff, parents, students and Traveller and Roma communities to remove barriers which affect Travellers’ engagement with, and experience of, education. Among the work undertaken through this pilot is the development of positive relationships between schools and Traveller and Roma communities, supporting effective transitions for Traveller children and young people from preschool on to primary, post-primary, and further and higher education and exploring and developing new approaches and initiatives to support Traveller and Roma children in education.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to review the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 and to ensure that the successor strategy has a stronger outcomes-focused approach. I will be working with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, and with the Minister, Deputy Harris, in respect of education initiatives as part of the review and engagement with Traveller representatives will inform this work. It is also worth noting some of the wider work which is under way within the Department to ensure that our schools are welcoming and positive spaces for the students and staff within them. I am thinking here of legislation such as the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019, which sets out guidelines for a framework which schools must apply in their engagement with students and parents. The Bill seeks to support schools in proactively consulting with their school communities and creating a positive school culture. From my background in education, I know that many schools are already very advanced in this regard but it is my hope that this legislation will help to further guide and underpin this excellent work. This Bill was passed by the Seanad during its last term and I look forward to returning to the House shortly for Second Stage of the Bill.At the core of any school community is the well-being of its students and staff. My Department seeks to promote the provision of a whole-school approach to supporting well-being. Such an approach has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for children and young people, including increased inclusion, social cohesion and social capital and improvements to mental health. The Department’s well-being policy, first published in 2018 and refreshed in 2019, is largely preventative in focus and seeks to reduce the risk factors and promote the protective factors for well-being in the school community. The provision of a positive school culture where children and young people experience a sense of safety, belonging and connectedness is a key protective factor, as is the opportunity to experience positive and respectful relationships across the school community. Since the well-being policy was published, work has taken place to realise the vision set out therein. Following an action research project involving 30 schools, the professional development service for teachers is developing continuing professional development to support schools as they engage in a well-being promotion process. This national roll-out of continuing professional development is due to begin in autumn 2021, depending on public health advice, and will continue for three years. Supports will be offered on a face-to-face basis in the first term of the 2021-22 school year, if public health guidelines allow. I reiterate my support for this Bill. As currently presented, this Bill provides an opportunity to recognise the unique position of Traveller culture and history within the overall Irish context. I am happy to support the Bill.	spk_376
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-07-01	dail	33	Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 [Seanad]: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_40	I thank the Deputies for their contributions. I also thank the Senators who previously contributed to the development of the Bill. I particularly acknowledge the personal engagement and personal witness of many of the contributors this evening. These have added greatly to the debate. It is such a positive step that we can garner unanimity within the Chamber on this issue. I am conscious that this Bill will not put everything to right. No Bill has that capacity but it is important that the Bill speak to opportunity and inclusion for all within the education system, especially Traveller children and young people. The Bill, as currently proposed, provides an opportunity for schools to promote Traveller culture and history. This, in turn, will assist in the development of a greater understanding of our shared history, culture and society. The work being done by the NCCA is important because that work will support schools in this regard. The engagement of an NCCA full-time education officer and the work and research, involving the gathering of examples of best practice and identifying resources and initiatives regarding Traveller culture and history, will support teachers and school leaders in delivering on the objectives of the Bill. The Department of Education will continue to progress the actions outlined in the NTRIS and the DEIS plan to support educational provision for Travellers. Officials will continue to collaborate positively and proactively with Traveller representative groups in the context of the NTRIS and education provision generally. The strategy pilot on supporting Traveller and Roma, STAR, is under way in four areas and provides for additional staff who work together with Traveller and Roma parents, children and young people, schools, Traveller and Roma communities and local and national service providers with the overall objective of improving Traveller and Roma attendance, participation and retention in education. It is intended that the evaluation of a pilot to be conducted in the next school year will inform future policy initiatives to support children and young people from the Traveller and Roma communities in their education. The funding provided by the Department of Education for the DEIS programme in 2021 is in the region of €150 million. A total of 887 schools are participating in the programme in the current school year. It is worth noting that approximately 50% of all Traveller students attend DEIS schools. Hence, while I acknowledge that not all Traveller pupils attend DEIS schools, the funding provided to DEIS schools means a greater proportion of Traveller students benefit relative to the general population. At the end of April, the Department hosted a shared learning day for all DEIS schools, with a particular focus on transitions, a central theme in action planning for improvement in these schools. Well-supported educational transitions are linked to positive educational outcomes. The event was an opportunity for DEIS schools to listen to experiences of successful transition from early years education to primary education and then to post-primary, further and higher education. As part of this event, the attendees heard the inspiring stories of both a Roma student and Traveller student about their individual experiences of our education system and the supports and individuals that helped them progress into and complete higher education and fulfil their potential to the fullest. Progress is being made on improving educational outcomes for Travellers but I accept more work remains to be done. We must always strive for a better education system, one which best meets the needs of all students within it. In supporting all initiatives to improve Traveller attendance, participation and progression in our education system, the Government agrees to support the Bill in its current format.	spk_392
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-06-02	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Before I address it specifically, I wish to provide the House an outline of the extent of the school transport service. School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the current school year, more than 114,000 children, including more than 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of more than €224.7 million in 2020. The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the primary and post-primary scheme, children are eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria - 3.2 km at primary level and 4.8 km at post-primary level - and are attending their nearest schools or education centres as determined by the Department or Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language. All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time are accommodated on school transport services for the 2021-2022 school year where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and will be facilitated where spare seats are available after eligible children have been accommodated. Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available, Bus Éireann allocates tickets for the spare seats using an agreed selection process. Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions, including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge. Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced and larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles will not be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis. As referenced by the Deputy, a review of the school transport scheme is under way with a view to taking a fresh look at the service and its broader effectiveness and sustainability. Given the evolving situation with Covid-19, the steering group's work on the review has been delayed. However, I am pleased to confirm that an initial meeting of the steering group was recently held in order to recommence the process, which will continue over the coming period. The review is being conducted to ensure that the school transport system is fit for purpose and serves students and their families adequately. The review will build on the proposals in the programme for Government as they relate to school transport, for example, by examining the options to reduce car journeys, assessing how the school transport scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools programme and examining the options for providing better value and a better service for students, including issues such as the nearest or next nearest school. It is planned that the steering group will report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses, with a view to presenting a final report later this year with recommendations on the future operation of the Department's school transport scheme. The steering group will report to me initially on preliminary findings regarding eligibility before moving to consider and report on broader issues such as the objectives of the scheme and its alignment with other initiatives and wider Government policy.	spk_32

Fundamentally, the process of standardisation will operate at national level. It is preferable to use aggregate or cohort data, as the evidence is that the use of junior cycle data in the regression model is of better predictive quality when done at a class group rather than an individual level, which is the same view as the Deputy has expressed. The amendment as drafted is potentially problematic. In general, some flexibility is needed on precisely what is included in the standardisation process rather than being overly defined by the Act. I cannot agree to the amendment, as in certain cases it is necessary to rely on the individual junior cycle result of an individual student where that student is typically an out-of-school learner or a student pursuing a subject out of school. This was the case in 2020 in respect of calculated grades and it is set out in the published national standardisation group report. In addition, in order to ensure we were being clear about the junior cycle's potential use in standardisation, the guide to State examinations and accredited grades for leaving certificate 2021, which issued in February, stated: ""Though the prior performance of the class group in Junior Cycle may be used in this process, the individual performance of the student at Junior Cycle would not be a determinant of their performance at Leaving Certificate, other than when the subject is being taken outside of school."" However, the accredited grades system is, overall, subject to the determination of policy by me. Specifically, section 2(2)(d) operates ""in accordance with such policy directions as the Minister may give"". On that basis, in rejecting the amendment, I am happy to include in my determination under section 2(1), which is our intention in any event, a policy direction expressly stating that the junior cycle and leaving certificate data used in the process of standardisation will be aggregated or cohort data subject to the flexibility referred to above in limited cases."	spk_352

This is not something that can be agreed to as the final composition or application of the process will not, or at least may not, be known right up to the day of the results. I can commit, at a minimum, to doing what we did last year in having the technical detail of the model and standardisation process published on results day. I am also happy to commit to publishing any other information on the process of standardisation in advance of results day. That is what I was clear we would do, and any information that could be published in advance of results day can be published in advance. We will be able to comment more on what it would be hoped to publish on the standardisation process once the standardisation process for 2021 has been developed. However, it is an iterative process and the algorithm used for the standardisation process will not be finished until the end of that process. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment as drafted.	spk_356

There is no intention whatsoever of concealing any detail. What is important to remember is that the process of standardisation is just that: it is a process, not a static formula. It is very important to point out that even if we were to look at the written leaving certificate exam in terms of that process, it also contains and has always consistently included standardisation. As to, for example, publishing the marking scheme of the written leaving certificate exam, that is never publicised or published until after the release of the results because, again, the standardisation process works there as well. There is an alignment between the written process and the accredited grades process this year or the calculated grades process. There is no question of not wishing to co-operate. As I said earlier, it is an iterative process and any detail that can be released in advance will be released in advance but, certainly, all of the data that need to be published, in a similar fashion to the publishing of the marking scheme for the written exams, will be published at the time of the results, and it is similar for the algorithm.	spk_358

As a matter of policy, the provision of estimated marks is grounded fundamentally in the professional judgment of teachers and school alignment before submission to the SEC. The definition of ""estimated mark"" in the Bill provides clarity on what professional judgment is understood to encompass. The process through which professional judgment is exercised would make it impossible that another person unknown to the student could be expected to review the evidence as a candidate's teacher had done, acknowledging that some of it will have been based on observation over the course of the senior cycle, and then be asked to provide an estimated mark that could be compared to the one initially provided. This would make the design of such an appeals system, even if it were desired, extremely difficult and potentially impossible. The appeal process would be highly likely to last several weeks, if not longer, and impede the candidate's progression to further study, or at least not facilitate it in terms of later rounds of offers. For these reasons, it is not possible to accept the amendment."	spk_361

In that regard, regulations are being drafted that give effect to the provisions concerned. I have already indicated to each House, including today, that there will be a robust review process that will not lead to decisions being made without considering individual circumstances. While the operation of the provision is always subject to the constitutional protection of fair procedures and natural justice, and while regulations are in development, section 7(2) expressly requires that the regulations provide for what the amendment would provide for. Section 7(2)(a) specifies that the candidate will be notified should a report in regard to a communication under section 4 be made, or what has been referred to as canvassing, or if false and misleading information is given, as provided for under section 5. The candidate then has the opportunity to ""make representations to the Commission"". In this way, the candidate is afforded the opportunity to be heard as the amendment intends. In addition, before any decision to withhold accredited grades is made, a review is carried out, and any decision arising to withhold results must be accompanied with reasons for the withholding and is subject to appeal. Therefore, there is a second opportunity for the candidate's views to be taken into account. I want to make it abundantly clear that there is every opportunity for the student to be heard. There is a robust review mechanism and a further appeal. There is no question but that the student will be heard at every opportunity."	spk_364

Section 7(2)(a) expressly provides that the student or candidate will have the opportunity to submit representations. If the student was unaware of any canvassing, the candidate has the opportunity to make that case in his or her representations, and if he or she makes that point, the review must take this into account when reaching any decision. The candidate enjoys the protection that, fundamentally, any decision following the review must be reasonably based on the information available to the review. As the intent of the amendment is already provided for, including by virtue of legal principles, the amendment does not improve the Bill. With regard to the drafting of the amendment itself, it could have unintended consequences and does not develop or elaborate on the policies or principles to be applied in determining how a candidate would show that he or she had no knowledge of a communication or in how the person making any communication would himself or herself be afforded fair procedures. The ultimate objective is to offer an opportunity to ensure that canvassing does not take place and to provide protection in that regard. It also provides protection to the student as students can make representations declaring that they were not aware of the canvassing. That will be taken into consideration during the review. I do not accept the amendment as proposed.	spk_370

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-18	dail	33	Sports Organisations	dbsect_31	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. Before I address the specific issues raised, I would like to provide Members with an outline of the extent of the school transport service and what it entails. School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the current school year, over 114,000 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over €224.7 million in 2020. The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the primary and post-primary scheme, children are eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school or education centre as determined by the Department or Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language.  All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport services for the 2021-22 school year, where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and will be facilitated where spare seats are available after eligible children have been accommodated. Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available, Bus Éireann allocates tickets for the spare seats using an agreed selection process. Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions, including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge. Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis. I understand that some parents may have a concern that they would not be considered eligible for transport to the next-nearest school if, due to the enrolment pressures mentioned by the Deputies, their nearest school is full. I would like to reassure them that in cases where the Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for school transport will be determined based on the distance that children reside from their next-nearest school, having regard to ethos and language. If a family has further information in regard to the closest school being full, they should contact the school transport section of the Department. In October 2019, my predecessor announced a review of the school transport scheme with a view to taking a fresh look at the service and its broader effectiveness and sustainability. Given the evolving situation with Covid-19, the work of the steering group had been delayed. However, an initial meeting of the steering group was recently held in order to recommence the process, which will continue over the coming period. The review is being conducted to ensure that the school transport system is fit for purpose and that it serves students and their families adequately. This review will build on the proposals in the programme for Government as they relate to school transport, including examining the options to reduce car journeys and assessing how the school transport scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools programme; and examining the options for providing better value and a better service for students, including examining issues such as the nearest or next-nearest school, which I know is of particular interest to the Deputies. It is planned that the steering group will report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses with a view to presenting a final report later this year with recommendations on the future operation of the Department’s school transport scheme.The steering group will report to me initially on preliminary findings on eligibility before moving to consider and report on broader issues such as the objectives of the scheme and its alignment with other initiatives and wider Government policy. This steering group is due to report to me shortly with its preliminary report.

With regard to the particular case referred to by the Deputies, I am assured by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, that the local special education needs organiser, SENO, is working with this family so that the child concerned is placed in the most suitable school placement and the necessary supports are put in place. Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority. Children with special educational needs should receive their education in placements that are appropriate to their needs alongside their peers wherever possible unless such an approach would be inconsistent with the best interests of the individual child or other children. This inclusive approach is consistent with the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. This policy is supported by significant investment on the part of the Government. The State will spend approximately €2 billion, or just under 25% of the entire education budget for 2021, on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year. The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on education provision for children nationwide. It has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in a given area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements. There are planning processes at both national and local levels to ensure the required number of specialist education places come on stream to meet identified need in a timely way. Normally, schools are very willing to respond to the emerging needs in their areas. However, where a shortage of places is identified, the Department of Education works closely with the NCSE and the schools in question to expand provision to meet local need. This collaboration works well. There has been strong collaboration and engagement between the partners in education, the parents and schools in making the provision possible. The NCSE is working with a significant number of families and schools to secure suitable placements for children with special educational needs. This is important work. I assure the Deputies that it is a priority for all concerned. We will continue to work hand in hand with the partners in education to ensure the individual needs of children are met in the appropriate environment, be it in a special class or a special school. On some of the points raised by the Deputies, early years education is not my domain but I take the point raised in respect of the need to have appropriately trained staff. Regarding the allocation of staff within the school setting, significant progress is being made in terms of the allocation of special needs assistants. The number of special education teachers is at a significantly higher level, with over 18,000 pupils covered. The same applies to staff with expertise in working with children with additional needs, including children with autism. It must be acknowledged that over one fifth of the budget is rightly being spent in the area of special education.	spk_472

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_15	The Government has always been guided by public health advice on what is safe in schools and that has been the case from the very beginning. The Chief Medical Officer, CMO, has made it clear in his advices to the Government that schools are places of low transmission, with very little evidence of transmission within schools, and that the majority of infections in children and adolescents occur outside the school setting. This is supported by public health doctors. Schools have put significant infection prevention control measures in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to or within the school and funding of almost €650 million has been put in place by the Department of Education to fund Covid-19 related measures, including funding for personal protective equipment, PPE, sanitisation, additional cleaning and other such measures. The HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of Covid-19. This advice covers children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions. For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the infection control measures promoted by the HPSC. The HPSC advises that children with immediate family members, including parents, in the high-risk and very high-risk categories can return to school and that it is important for the child's overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally on at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, and for all pupils and staff to continue to adhere to the school's infection control measures. The Tusla Education Support Service, TESS, continues to engage with students and families identified by schools as needing additional support, and will remain in ongoing contact with school principals to identify students who may need support going forward. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Tusla has adopted a child welfare approach to all engagement with learners and families, being very conscious that many families had been impacted severely by Covid-19.	spk_89

Equally, it is very important that we remember that within the education sector at every step of the way everything that we have sought to do and achieved has been done on foot of the best public health advice available to us. That advice is telling us that children are best served when they are in school. If they are children whose parents or family members are regarded as being particularly high risk, it is still the view of the public health experts that children themselves are best served by returning to school. Deputy Smith graciously acknowledged that significant work has been achieved in terms of the vaccination programme. We have been told that by the end of May or June, all of those with underlying conditions will have received their vaccination.	spk_91
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_15	I want to be very clear about this: where staff have been identified as very high risk, measures have been put in place for all staff to be replaced. Substantial funding has been made available for that and it has been drawn down throughout the country in recognition of the needs of specific staff who are regarded as very high risk. There is no question about staff who are very high risk being asked to return to school. If they were designated as very high risk, accommodation has been made and they have been substituted. Very high risk staff have been replaced within the school system. Equally, measures have been put in place for children who have been designated as very high risk. That has been the procedure that has been adopted since we returned to school. In fairness, the issue the Deputy raises in general – it is not appropriate for me to comment on a specific case – has been addressed by public health.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_15	Access to sexual and health education is an important right for students. Social, personal and health education, SPHE, is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary and post-primary schools. Relationships and sexuality education is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. The Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines. All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed through engagement and in consultation and collaboration with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students, as appropriate. The school's programme for RSE is developed and taught in the context of the school's RSE policy.Schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated. The programme for Government states that the Government will develop inclusive and age-appropriate curricula for relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE, across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+, and will make appropriate legislative changes, if necessary. The Department of Education is working closely with the National Council for Curriculum and assessment, NCCA, which continues the process of curricular development and publishing additional resources for SPHE and RSE to determine the approach to best give effect to this commitment in the programme for Government. This will include legislative change, if necessary. The report on the review of relationships and sexuality education - the RSE programme - in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA in December 2019. As part of the review of RSE, an extensive consultation occurred. Feedback was facilitated through an online survey, written submissions, round-table meetings and large events. Adjustments were made to the final report to reflect a stronger focus on issues that stakeholders wished to see highlighted. The NCCA is developing updated guidance materials for schools. It has established two development groups, which are currently working on the specifications, with a particular focus on the updating of the syllabus at junior cycle level.	spk_96

The Deputy specifically asked in regard to timelines. As I alluded to earlier, the NCCA is developing the updated guidelines and the information and a toolkit are available online for schools in the interim. With regard to the body of work that it is being done by the development groups, this is specifically aimed at providing new specifications in the syllabus for, in the first instance, the junior cycle and thereafter moving onwards. The work is being undertaken at present. The review of the junior cycle has been drafted and will be considered by the NCCA by the summer.

That policy, we must acknowledge, is developed in consultation with the entire school community, and the entire school community includes school management, parents, teachers and students, as appropriate. A school's programme for RSE is developed and taught, as the Deputy stated, in the context of the school's RSE policy. It is a shared policy and one that has been achieved through collaboration and engagement with all of the partners within the school forum. Equally, it is important to say that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring knowledge about the issues or from following the curriculum as outlined by the NCCA. It is important to note that there is an NCCA curriculum. Many individuals from a variety of different experiences and backgrounds would say there is a need for a new curriculum to be put in place in terms of RSE.

The NEPS casework service involves the provision of a psychological service for a student, with the psychologist working with the student, teachers and parents, and other professionals, if appropriate, to identify need and plan for intervention and review to support the student in school. This service can take place over an extended period of time with NEPS psychologists. This model does not operate on a waiting list basis. It extends to approximately 8,000 students per annum. The NEPS support and development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help them build their capability to respond to the well-being, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their well-being, learning, inclusion and participation. This model of service allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. The capacity of NEPS has increased significantly from its 2016 allocation of 173 whole-time equivalent psychologists. The capacity of NEPS was increased recently as part of a package of measures to support the reopening of our schools with the provision of an additional 17 psychologist posts to NEPS, bringing overall sanctioned numbers to 221 whole-time equivalent psychologist posts. This represents by far the highest number of psychologists sanctioned for NEPS since its inception in 2000. The capacity of NEPS will be kept under review and I hope to be in a position to increase this capacity in future years.	spk_102
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_15	It is important to point out that the provision of support in schools is not dependent on a NEPS assessment or diagnosis. A new model was introduced in 2016. I appreciate the Deputy acknowledging the various strands of work in which the NEPS psychologists are involved but it is very important to note that. The special education teaching, SET, model of resourcing, introduced in 2016, is a needs-based resourcing model. Schools are provided with additional resources to support pupils with additional learning needs, care needs or who have special educational needs from a set allocation of resources based on the school's profile. Schools then have discretion to provide additional supports for pupils based on their actual identified learning needs, as opposed to allocating set quantums of time to pupils who have been assessed as having a particular disability with certain pupils who may not have had an assessment excluded from the provision. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately, rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.	spk_104
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_15	I acknowledge, as the Deputy has, the excellent work on the ground by our schools and special education teachers. The model as introduced in 2016 is working more effectively, in that it does allow a child without a specific diagnosis to be catered for within the school environment by virtue of the hours that have been made available through the special education teacher. Since becoming Minister I have been very conscious of the value of this work in our schools and the emphasis on well-being and inclusion in our schools. For that reason, I very specifically made a determination about schools reopening as we returned, that additional psychologists would be made available for the benefit of schools and of children in particular. I have committed to keeping that under review and will continue to do so.	spk_106
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_15	Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils, which is at its historically lowest level. Under the programme for Government there is a commitment to make further progress in reducing the pupil-teacher ratios in primary schools and to support small schools. As part of the budget 2021 measures, the Government has sought to deliver on this commitment by the announcement of a one-point change to the primary staffing schedule and the introduction of a three-point reduction in the number of pupils required to retain a teacher currently in a school. That has been of enormous benefit to schools nationwide.  The staffing schedule for the 2021-22 school year was published last month and all schools can now establish their staffing for the coming school year on the basis of enrolments in September 2020.  The Department has published guidance for schools that takes account of the exceptional circumstances that have arisen for those pupils who are enrolled in school but have not returned to school during the 2020-21 school year but whose intention is to do so.  It is important that schools return valid enrolments to the Department to ensure an equitable allocation of resources to schools. The staffing arrangements also include a staffing appeal mechanism and a developing post application process, which allows for schools to be allocated posts on the basis of projected enrolments.  The appeal process also contains a number of other criteria that may be applicable to some schools where their enrolments has changed.  This year the Department and the primary staffing appeals board are cognisant of the impact of Covid-19 on schools and in that context will look carefully at all decisions on the allocation of teaching posts where schools have reduced enrolments to ensure that all decisions are reasonable and all schools are treated fairly. The primary staffing appeals board operates independently of the Department of Education.	spk_108
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_15	To be clear, the primary staffing appeals board is an independent board and operates independently of the Department. There is an opportunity for appeal. I cannot comment on the specific school the Deputy mentioned as I am not familiar with it or the format of its appeal. However, we did successfully reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to 26:1 this year. We also included the three-point reduction for the retention of a teacher. To be fair, that is a significant advancement for schools being able to hold onto a teacher and equally for the classroom base to be a ratio of 26:1. That is the level that schools are allocated in their entirety. If some classes are less than that and some are greater, that is a matter for the schools themselves distribute their teaching staff.	spk_110
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_15	I thank the Deputy. There has been a three-point reduction in the number of pupils required to hold on to a member of staff. For many schools, that has been very successful and beneficial. For others, it might have required a reduction of four, five or six. That is the position but there has been a significant advancement. Equally, there have been advancements regarding appeals, which can be ongoing. I cannot comment on the specifics the Deputy referred to but schools are entitled, where they have further information, to appeal again and make reference to the layout of the room, the number who can be facilitated in a room, the number of children who will be in a room, and so on. That is the basis for making an appeal. If there is a specific case where a class cannot be accommodated in a specific room, as we saw last year, accommodations can be made. I ask that the school address that in its appeal.	spk_112
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic Supports	dbsect_17	The Government has always been guided by public health advice on what is safe in schools and that has been the case from the very beginning. The Chief Medical Officer, CMO, has made it clear in his advices to the Government that schools are places of low transmission, with very little evidence of transmission within schools, and that the majority of infections in children and adolescents occur outside the school setting. This is supported by public health doctors. Schools have put significant infection prevention control measures in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to or within the school and funding of almost €650 million has been put in place by the Department of Education to fund Covid-19 related measures, including funding for personal protective equipment, PPE, sanitisation, additional cleaning and other such measures. The HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of Covid-19. This advice covers children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions. For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the infection control measures promoted by the HPSC. The HPSC advises that children with immediate family members, including parents, in the high-risk and very high-risk categories can return to school and that it is important for the child's overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally on at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, and for all pupils and staff to continue to adhere to the school's infection control measures. The Tusla Education Support Service, TESS, continues to engage with students and families identified by schools as needing additional support, and will remain in ongoing contact with school principals to identify students who may need support going forward. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Tusla has adopted a child welfare approach to all engagement with learners and families, being very conscious that many families had been impacted severely by Covid-19.	spk_89
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic Supports	dbsect_17	I do appreciate that this is an issue Deputy Bríd Smith has raised on an ongoing basis. I also appreciate the difficulties for individual families. I recognise that the issues the Deputy has raised are causing particular difficulties for families. Equally, it is very important that we remember that within the education sector at every step of the way everything that we have sought to do and achieved has been done on foot of the best public health advice available to us. That advice is telling us that children are best served when they are in school. If they are children whose parents or family members are regarded as being particularly high risk, it is still the view of the public health experts that children themselves are best served by returning to school. Deputy Smith graciously acknowledged that significant work has been achieved in terms of the vaccination programme. We have been told that by the end of May or June, all of those with underlying conditions will have received their vaccination.	spk_91
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic Supports	dbsect_17	I want to be very clear about this: where staff have been identified as very high risk, measures have been put in place for all staff to be replaced. Substantial funding has been made available for that and it has been drawn down throughout the country in recognition of the needs of specific staff who are regarded as very high risk. There is no question about staff who are very high risk being asked to return to school. If they were designated as very high risk, accommodation has been made and they have been substituted. Very high risk staff have been replaced within the school system. Equally, measures have been put in place for children who have been designated as very high risk. That has been the procedure that has been adopted since we returned to school. In fairness, the issue the Deputy raises in general – it is not appropriate for me to comment on a specific case – has been addressed by public health. We have engaged with the public health experts on an ongoing basis and their advice is that children are best served in school.	spk_94
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Curriculum	dbsect_18	Access to sexual and health education is an important right for students. Social, personal and health education, SPHE, is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary and post-primary schools. Relationships and sexuality education is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. The Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines. All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed through engagement and in consultation and collaboration with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students, as appropriate. The school's programme for RSE is developed and taught in the context of the school's RSE policy.Schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated. The programme for Government states that the Government will develop inclusive and age-appropriate curricula for relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE, across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+, and will make appropriate legislative changes, if necessary. The Department of Education is working closely with the National Council for Curriculum and assessment, NCCA, which continues the process of curricular development and publishing additional resources for SPHE and RSE to determine the approach to best give effect to this commitment in the programme for Government. This will include legislative change, if necessary. The report on the review of relationships and sexuality education - the RSE programme - in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA in December 2019. As part of the review of RSE, an extensive consultation occurred. Feedback was facilitated through an online survey, written submissions, round-table meetings and large events. Adjustments were made to the final report to reflect a stronger focus on issues that stakeholders wished to see highlighted. The NCCA is developing updated guidance materials for schools. It has established two development groups, which are currently working on the specifications, with a particular focus on the updating of the syllabus at junior cycle level.	spk_96
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Curriculum	dbsect_18	In the first instance, the primary objective within a school is to ensure that all children, irrespective of their backgrounds, beliefs or orientation, are welcomed and included, and that is what we wish the experience of education to be for all concerned. The Deputy specifically asked in regard to timelines. As I alluded to earlier, the NCCA is developing the updated guidelines and the information and a toolkit are available online for schools in the interim. With regard to the body of work that it is being done by the development groups, this is specifically aimed at providing new specifications in the syllabus for, in the first instance, the junior cycle and thereafter moving onwards. The work is being undertaken at present. The review of the junior cycle has been drafted and will be considered by the NCCA by the summer. Subsequent work on the development of the new junior cycle curriculum programme will begin in the new school year.	spk_98
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Curriculum	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy. As I have stated clearly, all schools are required to have an RSE policy. That policy, we must acknowledge, is developed in consultation with the entire school community, and the entire school community includes school management, parents, teachers and students, as appropriate. A school's programme for RSE is developed and taught, as the Deputy stated, in the context of the school's RSE policy. It is a shared policy and one that has been achieved through collaboration and engagement with all of the partners within the school forum. Equally, it is important to say that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring knowledge about the issues or from following the curriculum as outlined by the NCCA. It is important to note that there is an NCCA curriculum. Many individuals from a variety of different experiences and backgrounds would say there is a need for a new curriculum to be put in place in terms of RSE. That work is ongoing and, as I said, it will continue right into next year.	spk_100

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_21	I thank the Deputy and appreciate the question. I recognise the great importance of investing in special education. A significant investment is being made in both special classes and special schools by the Department of Education. Almost one fifth of the Department's budget, amounting to €2 billion, is spent on special education annually. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the HSE. This includes the establishment of special classes and special school placements in geographical areas where there is an identified need. When the NCSE sanctions a special class in a school, the school authorities can apply to my Department for capital funding to reconfigure an existing space within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation under my Department's additional school accommodation scheme, or both. Similarly, where special schools are requested to expand provision or wish to refurbish existing facilities, they may apply to my Department for capital funding to carry out these works. Between 2018 and 2020, permanent accommodation was delivered for 229 special classes and for 67 new classrooms in special schools.  As the Deputy is aware, a minor works grant is payable to all primary schools. This grant provides good flexibility at local level to make improvements to the physical infrastructure of school buildings, including the enhancement of facilities for special needs pupils. The grant payment structure reflects the priority of supporting special needs provision, with the grant rate for special needs students in special classes and special schools being four times the standard rate for mainstream students. For example, a 60-pupil primary school will receive €19,830, comprising €6,610 paid in July, a further €6,610 in additional funding as part of July stimulus, and an early payment of €6,610. 	spk_114
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_21	The funding streams being made available to schools are often four times the standard rate of funding made available for mainstream students. That is as it should be. The Deputy referred specifically to smaller schools. A 60-pupil primary school receives just short of €20,000, which comprises grants spread throughout the year, including the minor works payment in July, the minor works payment later in the year and the stimulus package. That means substantial additional funding for schools in terms of minor works. On top of that, there is funding being provided for personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning and the replacement of staff. With regard to other grants, furniture and equipment grants are available to schools. For example, there is a start-up grant of €6,500, an ICT grant of more than €5,000, a furniture grant of €2,500, and a multisensory room grant €7,000, all made available to special schools.	spk_116
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_21	I thank the Deputy. I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the home supports being made available. It is a positive and progressive step forward. I take the Deputy's point on making the public aware of the funding streams available to special schools. I will certainly take it on board. The funding is available but I take the point that there might well be an opportunity to disseminate the information more widely and to make it more accessible to parents and guardians. With regard to the setting up of an ASD class, the Deputy made specific reference to multisensory rooms. There is a grant of around €7,000 for the development of multisensory rooms in special schools. That is in addition to the other funds I outlined.	spk_118
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_21	I appreciate the Deputy raising this question on the floor of the House. The Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. From 11 January 2021, all students, including those currently in fifth year and who are due to sit the leaving certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools. However, students in fifth year were prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students.As the Deputy is aware, all students have now returned to school. The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, the Department of Education provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils and students in a Covid-19 context. The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils' continuity of learning during those periods. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated significant innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation, including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning. A number of adjustments have been made to the assessment arrangements for the 2021 leaving certificate examinations to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by the students who are due to take these examinations this year. I am particularly conscious that current fifth year students have also experienced some disruption to their learning and this will be considered in determining the assessment arrangements for the State examinations in 2022.	spk_120
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_21	I reiterate that I am conscious of the particular difficulties and stresses for students throughout the Covid pandemic. In the context of the well-being of and supports for students, I acknowledge that schools and everybody involved in the school community have very much taken a well-being approach to supporting, mentoring, catering to and encouraging students with regard to school. We are all conscious of issues. Much of the advice about well-being issues, as the Deputy pointed out, has been highlighted by NEPS, as I alluded to earlier. On the current cohort of fifth years who will be leaving certificate students next year, I want to be clear. As I have said previously, that suitable accommodations for assessment were made for the leaving certificate class of 2021 and consideration is being given to what supports can be put in place for the affected students in 2022.	spk_122
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_21	I reiterate the particular interest that I have, as has the Deputy, in the well-being of students and, beyond that, for the entire school community. It is important to consider that the experience of Covid-19 has created challenges for us all, so I include the wider school community when considering the need to provide resources and support for well-being. As the Deputy has referenced the cohort of students who will take the leaving certificate examinations next year, I want to be clear that even in the budget in October, I was conscious of the need for supports and making additional school counsellors available. I was pleased that more than 100 additional posts for guidance counsellors were provided in our schools. I referred earlier to the provision of a substantial number of additional NEPS psychologists. NEPS has been working with schools to roll out specific programmes that identify, promote and enhance the existing well-being structures in our schools.	spk_124
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_21	I appreciate the Deputy raising the question. As he will be aware, it was previously raised by another Deputy. It is a priority of mine and has been since I became Minister to reduce the pupil:teacher ratio, which we succeeded in doing, and also to address the points required for the retention of a teacher, which have fallen by three points this year. That is important and has proven to be of significant benefit to schools. Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher to 26 pupils which, as I said, is at an historic low. In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to make further progress in reducing the pupil-teacher ratios in primary schools and supporting small schools. As part of the budget, as I have outlined, we reduced it by one to 26:1 and introduced a three point reduction to retain a teacher. This announcement continues to build on this progress to date and for the 2021-22 school year, the staffing schedule will be on the basis of one teacher for every 25 pupils. The latest figures for the pupil-teacher ratio show an improved ratio of students to teachers from 16:1 to 15:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015-16 school year to the 2019-20 school year. Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 24.1 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend. The staffing schedule, which is at an historic low, will help to ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that fewer pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher. The new staffing schedule for 2021-22, taking account of the recent budget measure, was published last month and schools are in a position to establish what their staffing arrangements are for the 2021-22 school year. The new schedule has received a positive welcome from schools. It is an historical low. We would like at all points for it to be as low as possible but it is not possible to do it in one fell swoop.

I am committed to incrementally reducing the pupil-teacher ratio further every year, within budgetary constraints. The Deputy specifically alluded to very large classes.

The current national development plan, NDP, as part of the Project Ireland 2040 framework, provides for an €8.8 billion investment in schools during the period from 2018 to 2027. The increased investment under the NDP is positioning the State to focus on adding and modernising capacity in the school system. During the NDP period 2018-2020, 526 building projects were completed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme. These projects delivered in excess of 48,000 school places, including permanent accommodation for 229 special classes, and additional capacity for 67 classrooms in 14 special schools throughout the country. Of the 526 school building projects completed in the period from 2018 to 2020, 24 were delivered in County Tipperary. The Department has a significant existing pipeline of projects to be delivered over the coming years to meet capacity needs. This is managed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme. Overall, there are 61 building projects across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction in County Tipperary, five of which fall under the large-scale capital programme and a further 56 under the additional school accommodation scheme. Two of these projects are at project brief stage, one is at detailed design stage and two are on site as we speak. I have made arrangements for the details of these 61 school building projects to be forwarded directly to the Deputy.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_21	School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year, more than 114,000 children, including 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over €224.7 million in 2020. Having regard to available resources, the purpose of the scheme is to support the transport to and from school of children whose places of residence are remote from their nearest schools. All children who are eligible and complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport in the 2021-22 school year where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis where seats are available after all eligible applicants have been accommodated. The Department has engaged intensively with Bus Éireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of school transport scheme services for the 2020-21 school year. Based on public health advice, the Department provided for school transport scheme services for the 2020-21 school year to operate fully, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing using 50% of passenger capacity. My officials engage on a weekly basis with public health consultants from the HSE on the safe operation of schools, including school transport. The requirement to implement additional measures on school transport services in the 2021-22 school year will be dependent on the prevailing public health advice at that time. It is difficult at this point to make a projection, given that we will be using the most up-to-date advice available to us at the time. In addition, the Department is conducting a review of the school transport scheme to ensure that it is fit for purpose and serves students and their families adequately. All consideration will be given to the public health advice that is available to us in advance of the return to school.	spk_144
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_21	To be clear, the process is that all children who are eligible and complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport services for the 2021-2022 school year. Children who are not eligible may apply for school transport on a concessionary basis. If seats are available, even where capacity is at 50%, they will be made available on a concessionary basis. I want to be clear, as we look back on what we have achieved in education and forward to what we will do in future, that everything we have done has been, and will be, on the basis of the public health advice that is made available to us. As we began this school year, the advice was that, at second level, school transport would have to operate at 50% capacity. Things are looking much more positive for society in general in terms of how we are progressing. We are hopeful that the reduced capacity on school transport may no longer be required in due course, but I cannot say it will be so. We will operate on the basis of the available public health advice.	spk_146
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_21	I appreciate the Deputy's interest in this issue. I am very clear in terms of school transport. It is important to acknowledge that we are conducting a review of the service. It is my intention that we will do all we can to ensure that as wide an access as possible is provided in terms of eligibility of children and young people for school transport. That is part of the remit of the current review. I have to be honest with the Deputy and say that where pubic health advice pertains, that advice will be followed. If the advice is to operate at 50% capacity, then we will have 50% capacity. However, there is scope within that, as there was previously, for accommodation of those who avail of transport on a concessionary basis. No one who is eligible will be excluded from that remit. More than 98% of buses have run at 50% capacity, at a cost of between €87 million and €135 million. I can revert to the Deputy with any further information he requires.	spk_148
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_22	I thank the Deputy and appreciate the question. I recognise the great importance of investing in special education. A significant investment is being made in both special classes and special schools by the Department of Education. Almost one fifth of the Department's budget, amounting to €2 billion, is spent on special education annually. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the HSE. This includes the establishment of special classes and special school placements in geographical areas where there is an identified need. When the NCSE sanctions a special class in a school, the school authorities can apply to my Department for capital funding to reconfigure an existing space within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation under my Department's additional school accommodation scheme, or both. Similarly, where special schools are requested to expand provision or wish to refurbish existing facilities, they may apply to my Department for capital funding to carry out these works. Between 2018 and 2020, permanent accommodation was delivered for 229 special classes and for 67 new classrooms in special schools.  As the Deputy is aware, a minor works grant is payable to all primary schools. This grant provides good flexibility at local level to make improvements to the physical infrastructure of school buildings, including the enhancement of facilities for special needs pupils. The grant payment structure reflects the priority of supporting special needs provision, with the grant rate for special needs students in special classes and special schools being four times the standard rate for mainstream students. For example, a 60-pupil primary school will receive €19,830, comprising €6,610 paid in July, a further €6,610 in additional funding as part of July stimulus, and an early payment of €6,610. 	spk_114
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_22	The funding streams being made available to schools are often four times the standard rate of funding made available for mainstream students. That is as it should be. The Deputy referred specifically to smaller schools. A 60-pupil primary school receives just short of €20,000, which comprises grants spread throughout the year, including the minor works payment in July, the minor works payment later in the year and the stimulus package. That means substantial additional funding for schools in terms of minor works. On top of that, there is funding being provided for personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning and the replacement of staff. With regard to other grants, furniture and equipment grants are available to schools. For example, there is a start-up grant of €6,500, an ICT grant of more than €5,000, a furniture grant of €2,500, and a multisensory room grant €7,000, all made available to special schools.	spk_116

I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the home supports being made available. It is a positive and progressive step forward. I take the Deputy's point on making the public aware of the funding streams available to special schools. I will certainly take it on board. The funding is available but I take the point that there might well be an opportunity to disseminate the information more widely and to make it more accessible to parents and guardians. With regard to the setting up of an ASD class, the Deputy made specific reference to multisensory rooms. There is a grant of around €7,000 for the development of multisensory rooms in special schools. That is in addition to the other funds I outlined.	spk_118
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_23	I appreciate the Deputy raising this question on the floor of the House. The Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. From 11 January 2021, all students, including those currently in fifth year and who are due to sit the leaving certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools. However, students in fifth year were prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students.As the Deputy is aware, all students have now returned to school. The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, the Department of Education provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils and students in a Covid-19 context. The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils' continuity of learning during those periods. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated significant innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation, including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning. A number of adjustments have been made to the assessment arrangements for the 2021 leaving certificate examinations to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by the students who are due to take these examinations this year. I am particularly conscious that current fifth year students have also experienced some disruption to their learning and this will be considered in determining the assessment arrangements for the State examinations in 2022.	spk_120
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_23	I reiterate that I am conscious of the particular difficulties and stresses for students throughout the Covid pandemic. In the context of the well-being of and supports for students, I acknowledge that schools and everybody involved in the school community have very much taken a well-being approach to supporting, mentoring, catering to and encouraging students with regard to school. We are all conscious of issues. Much of the advice about well-being issues, as the Deputy pointed out, has been highlighted by NEPS, as I alluded to earlier. On the current cohort of fifth years who will be leaving certificate students next year, I want to be clear. As I have said previously, that suitable accommodations for assessment were made for the leaving certificate class of 2021 and consideration is being given to what supports can be put in place for the affected students in 2022.	spk_122
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_23	I reiterate the particular interest that I have, as has the Deputy, in the well-being of students and, beyond that, for the entire school community. It is important to consider that the experience of Covid-19 has created challenges for us all, so I include the wider school community when considering the need to provide resources and support for well-being. As the Deputy has referenced the cohort of students who will take the leaving certificate examinations next year, I want to be clear that even in the budget in October, I was conscious of the need for supports and making additional school counsellors available. I was pleased that more than 100 additional posts for guidance counsellors were provided in our schools. I referred earlier to the provision of a substantial number of additional NEPS psychologists. NEPS has been working with schools to roll out specific programmes that identify, promote and enhance the existing well-being structures in our schools.	spk_124

As he will be aware, it was previously raised by another Deputy. It is a priority of mine and has been since I became Minister to reduce the pupil:teacher ratio, which we succeeded in doing, and also to address the points required for the retention of a teacher, which have fallen by three points this year. That is important and has proven to be of significant benefit to schools. Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher to 26 pupils which, as I said, is at an historic low. In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to make further progress in reducing the pupil-teacher ratios in primary schools and supporting small schools. As part of the budget, as I have outlined, we reduced it by one to 26:1 and introduced a three point reduction to retain a teacher. This announcement continues to build on this progress to date and for the 2021-22 school year, the staffing schedule will be on the basis of one teacher for every 25 pupils. The latest figures for the pupil-teacher ratio show an improved ratio of students to teachers from 16:1 to 15:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015-16 school year to the 2019-20 school year. Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 24.1 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend. The staffing schedule, which is at an historic low, will help to ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that fewer pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher. The new staffing schedule for 2021-22, taking account of the recent budget measure, was published last month and schools are in a position to establish what their staffing arrangements are for the 2021-22 school year. The new schedule has received a positive welcome from schools. It is an historical low. We would like at all points for it to be as low as possible but it is not possible to do it in one fell swoop. We will continue to work on it.	spk_126

The Department has engaged intensively with Bus Éireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of school transport scheme services for the 2020-21 school year. Based on public health advice, the Department provided for school transport scheme services for the 2020-21 school year to operate fully, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing using 50% of passenger capacity. My officials engage on a weekly basis with public health consultants from the HSE on the safe operation of schools, including school transport. The requirement to implement additional measures on school transport services in the 2021-22 school year will be dependent on the prevailing public health advice at that time. It is difficult at this point to make a projection, given that we will be using the most up-to-date advice available to us at the time. In addition, the Department is conducting a review of the school transport scheme to ensure that it is fit for purpose and serves students and their families adequately. All consideration will be given to the public health advice that is available to us in advance of the return to school.	spk_144
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_27	To be clear, the process is that all children who are eligible and complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport services for the 2021-2022 school year. Children who are not eligible may apply for school transport on a concessionary basis. If seats are available, even where capacity is at 50%, they will be made available on a concessionary basis. I want to be clear, as we look back on what we have achieved in education and forward to what we will do in future, that everything we have done has been, and will be, on the basis of the public health advice that is made available to us. As we began this school year, the advice was that, at second level, school transport would have to operate at 50% capacity. Things are looking much more positive for society in general in terms of how we are progressing. We are hopeful that the reduced capacity on school transport may no longer be required in due course, but I cannot say it will be so. We will operate on the basis of the available public health advice.	spk_146
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_27	I appreciate the Deputy's interest in this issue. I am very clear in terms of school transport. It is important to acknowledge that we are conducting a review of the service. It is my intention that we will do all we can to ensure that as wide an access as possible is provided in terms of eligibility of children and young people for school transport. That is part of the remit of the current review. I have to be honest with the Deputy and say that where pubic health advice pertains, that advice will be followed. If the advice is to operate at 50% capacity, then we will have 50% capacity. However, there is scope within that, as there was previously, for accommodation of those who avail of transport on a concessionary basis. No one who is eligible will be excluded from that remit. More than 98% of buses have run at 50% capacity, at a cost of between €87 million and €135 million. I can revert to the Deputy with any further information he requires.	spk_148
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Education (Leaving Certificate 2021) (Accredited Grades) Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_33	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time.""Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil as ucht an am agus an deis a thabhairt dom labhairt anseo inniu. I am honoured to be in the House to bring the Education (Leaving Certificate Examinations) (Accredited Grades) Bill 2021 forward on Second Stage and to open this debate. As Members will be aware, the Bill has already passed through Seanad Éireann. On Second Stage in that House, many contributions were made that demonstrated the importance Senators attach to education. I am sure that will also be a feature of this afternoon's debate in this House. When I was appointed as Minister for Education on 27 June last year, I had three immediate priorities. The first was the implementation of a summer programme, which was ultimately shown to be very successful and upon which we built the 2021 summer programme. The latter was announced on Tuesday, with a doubling of available funding. The second priority was to prepare for the reopening of schools last autumn and to recognise how it was vital to support leaving certificate students because, even under normal circumstances, completing the leaving certificate and transitioning to the next phase of life can be a challenging time for all students and their families. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, this challenge has been heightened for students. The students have missed out on important rites of passage and have sacrificed time with their friends, playing sport, working in part-time jobs, and so much more in order to protect their loved ones and, indeed, broader society. For many of these students, the continued operation of school has been an important source of routine and stability. I commend school leaders and communities on the work they continue to do to maintain and sustain our schools and keep them open. From the successful reopening of schools in late August and early September last year, students were able to attend school each day, which provided an important social outlet for them, ensured they received the academic support they needed and, in some cases, provided respite from challenging personal circumstances. Regrettably, in January, amid very high levels of Covid-19 and the increased challenges associated with new variants of concern, our schools were required to close for another period to support the broader minimisation of movement within Irish society. This period of school closure, similar to last year's, inhibited many students' learning and heightened a sense of anxiety and isolation at a time when students are in particular need of academic and holistic supports. Amid this considerable uncertainty and in the context of the loss of in-person learning, the Government took the decision to provide leaving certificate students with a choice between accredited grades and sitting examinations in a safe manner or availing of a combination of both. Last year, the decision on calculated grades was made at a time when legislation to empower the State Examinations Commission, SEC, to operate the process could not be brought forward. As a result, the calculated grades system was operated by the Department of Education, with the support of staff seconded from the SEC. The SEC's powers are as set out in the establishment order of 2003. Those powers relate solely to the operation of examinations as defined in the Education Act 1998. All this and, most acutely, the need to support the leaving certificate class of 2021 have led the Government to bring forward the Bill before the House. In 2020, the approach taken to calculated grades was debated in this House on many occasions, and there are lessons to learn and to be applied from the 2020 experience. The approach the Government is taking to leaving certificate 2021 seeks to apply those lessons. The Government has listened to the views and reflections of the advisory group on the State examinations, which was established in 2020 and reconvened in recent months. Many have paid tribute to the role played by students in that group. I add my voice in acknowledging the role played by the issue representatives and, indeed, all the partners in education who contributed to the process. It is important to set out the difference between accredited grades in 2021 and the calculated grates process in 2020. First, subject to the enactment of this Bill, the system will be operated by the SEC. Second, and perhaps most important, and subject to public health advice and considerations, written leaving certificate examinations will proceed according to the normal timetable this summer, with the main schedule of examinations commencing on 9 June. This is designed to ensure that the choice afforded to students is real. A clear process has been put in place to facilitate students who are studying outside school settings, either entirely or in individual subjects, to obtain accredited grades. I have been very clear that the school historical data, which some refer to as school profiles and which were ultimately excluded from the 2020 system, will also be excluded from the accredited grades system in 2021. A point of concern for some teachers in 2020 related to student rank order data being released. This year, teachers are not being asked to generate class rankings. The Department of Education has engaged Educational Testing Service, ETS, as the contractor to develop and deliver the standardisation process on school-generated estimated marks. We also expect to appoint a second quality assurance contractor shortly to provide an added layer of confidence that the process of standardisation operates as expected. While Deputies have had the opportunity to consider the Bill, I will now summarise its principal provisions. Section 1 sets out the definitions to be used in the Bill. The definition of ""Leaving Certificate 2021"" comprehends the conventional examinations and the accredited grades process, and also confirms that this legislation applies only to the 2021 leaving certificate examinations. Section 2 sets out the main elements of the system of accredited grades, in respect of which I will make a formal determination, having taken the advice of the SEC, once the Bill is enacted. Section 3 provides for the indemnity, previously approved by the Government, that is written comprehensively to include any person who performs a function in relation to the provision of estimated marks. This puts the 2020 position on a statutory footing for 2021.Section 4 deals with canvassing of those providing estimated marks and stipulates that, where such canvassing occurs, the SEC may withhold results from a candidate. Detailed procedures in that regard will be provided for in regulations which are being prepared. Section 5 provides for an ability for the SEC to withhold results if false or misleading information is provided for the purpose of the award of an estimated mark. Section 6 provides a non-exhaustive list of the functions that are to be conferred upon the SEC and should be read in conjunction with section 2. Section 7 provides a regulation giving power to the Minister to give effect to various procedural aspects provided in other sections, principally in regard to the withholding of results and the operation and conduct of appeals. Section 8 contains a power to designate people to be tutors in addition to those already defined in the Bill. This is intended as a safety net in case somebody or a class of tutors has been inadvertently omitted from the definition as currently drafted. Section 9 provides the SEC with the power to provide a leaving certificate in respect of 2020 to students and ensures that the leaving certificate of 2020 will have the same look and feel as it would have in any other year. Section 10 provides a statutory basis on which the personal data of leaving certificate 2021 candidates can be processed for the purposes of the operation of the accredited grades system. This section has been the subject of consultation with the Data Protection Commission. Sections 11 to 13, inclusive, are standard in nature and relate to the laying of orders before the Oireachtas, expenses and how the Bill, once enacted, may be cited. In outlining the details of the various sections, I indicated that regulations will be required in some instances and their drafting will proceed in parallel with the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. The administrative planning for and early steps in the accredited grades process are under way, being led in the first instance by my Department pending the enactment of the Bill. This work is done in close co-operation with the SEC, which will assume the lead role when the appropriate legislative powers are conferred upon it. A variety of guidance documents have issued to students, schools and those studying outside of school settings in recent weeks. The candidate self-service portal allows candidates to make choices in each of their subjects about whether to sit written exams, receive accredited grades, or both, for the 2021 leaving certificate. The SEC is continuing its engagement with schools and candidates that have not yet registered or, having registered, have not confirmed their options. The various strands of preparatory works for the leaving certificate are well under way, with the oral and practical examinations for the vast majority of students having taken place, while last Saturday, leaving certificate vocational programme students sat link modules and those seeking accredited grades in non-curricular languages undertook proficiency assessments. From tomorrow, 14 May, teachers may proceed to generate estimated marks in the period until 28 May, with the school alignment phase and submission of data following immediately after that. I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies."	spk_236
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-13	dail	33	Education (Leaving Certificate 2021) (Accredited Grades) Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_33	In my opening remarks, I set out the objectives and principles underpinning this Bill. Its core function is to help students from the leaving certificate class of 2021 to complete their schooling and to progress to the next chapter of their lives. This progression and transition is one of the recognised milestones in so many students' lives, going back many years. It is one of the traditions for so many students. This Bill, when enacted, will confer new or additional powers on the SEC, the body which has managed and operated the State examinations for almost 20 years in a very professional way. The SEC enjoys the confidence of all the actors in the education system in that regard but, most importantly, through this legislation, the students of leaving certificate 2021 will be treated in a very similar fashion to their predecessors. The leaving certificate that this year's students will receive will have the same look and feel to it as any other year. This is true too for the class of 2020, whose certificates will issue from the SEC, also by virtue of this Bill. The Bill, in conferring those additional powers on the SEC, allows me as Minister to ensure that we can bring some normality to the lives of students in these most unusual and, on occasion, challenging of times. Just as the country is now looking forward to reopening and returning to so much that we have had to pause since spring 2020, so too the students of the leaving certificate class of 2021 can look forward. Deputies, through their contributions, showed their concern and interest in the education of this year's sixth-year students. We have a shared objective in wanting the best for all students, even if at times we might differ on how exactly to achieve that. I know there are different views, or perhaps views that seek to place an emphasis on different elements of the various processes which we have put in place. This debate has ensured that the points of concern to Deputies have been heard. I will reflect on all that has been presented here this afternoon, but it is important to indicate that much that was discussed here by Deputies, which I accept was in very good faith, was very much outside the remit of the Bill. The Bill refers to the accredited grades process for leaving certificate 2021. That is all that it refers to, and not to senior cycle reform and other such matters. On that point - it was a thread through the debate this afternoon, as Deputies are aware - I acknowledge that the senior cycle is under review and the advisory report is due imminently. In fairness, that will be a catalyst to affording us an opportunity to examine the senior cycle programme. It will involve engagement from all of the partners in education and from the widest possible remit of those who have an interest in the education sector. I look forward to the views of Deputies also on how we plan and move forward with the senior cycle. Everyone concerned with leaving certificate 2021, starting with me, my colleagues in government, the officials in my Department and the SEC, including the partners in education, are committed to ensuring that we deliver for the class of 2021. We committed to delivering a choice. We aimed to improve on the experience of calculated grades in 2020. We will also be considering how we can ensure that next year's leaving certificate class is treated fairly. I believe the Bill will deliver on the choice for students announced by the Government between accredited grades, examinations, or a combination of both. It will deliver a fair reflection of the students' educational attainment at post-primary level and it will deliver their passport to travel to the next stage of their lives. It has been a very challenging year for the country and its people and, given our focus today, for the leaving certificate class of 2021. Since the first Covid-19 restrictions were introduced in March of last year, we have seen enormous resilience shown right throughout society. We have seen great solidarity being shown and we have seen solutions and supports delivered, particularly for students, through school communities across the country. The leaving certificate class of 2021 deserve our support and this Bill is a part of ensuring that we continue to deliver for the class of 2021. For these reasons and with the support of Members, I commend the Bill to the House.	spk_275
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-12	dail	33	Harbours and Piers	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline the position with regard to the accommodation needs of St. Gabriel's Special School in Bishopstown, County Cork. This matter has been raised with me by a number of public representatives, including my Cabinet colleagues and the Taoiseach. St. Gabriel's Special School is the primary school under the patronage of the Brothers of Charity. The school caters for children and teenagers aged four to 18 years of age with severe and profound learning disability and those in this category with associated autistic spectrum disorder, ASD. The current staffing at the school includes a principal, eight mainstream teachers and 30 special needs assistants, SNAs, with an enrolment in 2021 of 43 pupils. St. Gabriel's Special School is currently accommodated in a former primary school building. Another former primary school building adjoins St. Gabriel's and St. Gabriel's has secured the use of some additional space in this property, as has been outlined. Both school buildings are owned by the Diocese of Cork and Ross. This property has the potential to offer the school valuable extra space to meet its accommodation needs. Remedial work is required to the property to facilitate its use by St. Gabriel's. The Department has been liaising with the school regarding its accommodation needs. An architect and an engineer from the Department's building unit recently visited the school. It is intended that the visit will assist in identifying proposed works that could be undertaken in the building, taking account of the specific needs of the school. The Department is also engaging with the Diocese of Cork and Ross, as owner of the buildings, in this regard. The Department is committed to providing for the school's long-term accommodation needs and is considering all the options available. It will continue to engage with the school in this regard. Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for the Government. The Department's policy is that children with special educational needs should be included, where possible and appropriate, in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special schools and special class places are provided for. This year, the Department will invest over 20% of its education budget, or €2 billion, in supporting children with special needs. As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants, special classes and special school places are at unprecedented levels. Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 235%, from 548 to over 1,800 for the 2020-21 school year. Some 199 new special classes have been established nationally for the 2020-21 school year. Budget 2021 also provides for an additional 235 special class teachers this year, supporting the provision of over 1,200 additional special classes. An additional 990 special needs assistants brings the provision of special needs assistants to a record of more than 18,000. An additional 145 special education teachers brings the total provision to more than 13,000 in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, with an additional 23 special education teachers to be allocated to meet increased enrolments in special schools. Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, I am acutely aware that there are parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. The Department's schools building programme is focused on providing additional school places to ensure that every child, including children with special needs, has a school place. This includes opening new schools and extending existing schools in areas where more school places are needed to meet the growing number of children living in these areas. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and patrons. The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements. It continues to work with and support the families who have a recommendation for, and are seeking to secure, a special school placement. A number of meetings between the Department, the NCSE and relevant stakeholders, including patron bodies, have taken place to consider how the demand for special school places in Cork can be met. The Deputies will be aware that new special schools in Cork and Dublin will be established for the 2021-22 school year.	spk_12
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-05-12	dail	33	Harbours and Piers	dbsect_3	I confirm that I am very conscious of the excellent work that takes place daily in the school and of the support provided by school communities, parents, guardians and all who are invested in the progress of the school. Notwithstanding the difficult circumstances of a Covid-19 environment, I fully acknowledge all that is achieved daily by the entire school community. It is important to note that the Department of Education places an extremely high priority on provision and support for children with particular educational needs. For the first time ever, over one fifth of our budget, equalling some €2 billion, is being provided directly for the area of special education. That speaks to our commitment. I acknowledge, as have previous speakers, that our determination to progress issues specific to Cork is emphasised and underlined by the provision of a new school in Carrigaline. That is a positive step on which we will build. On St. Gabriel's Special School, the Department is committed to providing for the school's long-term accommodation needs and is considering all options available. The Department will continue to engage with the school, the diocese and all necessary stakeholders in progressing the future of the school. An architect and an engineer have visited. That progress in recent months is positive because it can be seen visually on the ground that we are committed to advancing and expediting this as much as possible. I thank the Deputies for raising the matter of the plans for St. Gabriel's Special School in Cork. I commit to expediting it as much as possible. The progress we have made in recent months is testament to our determination to do that in the shortest timeframe possible.	spk_15

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	I am happy to be here to continue the discussions which some of the Deputies in the Chamber today and I had at the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science yesterday. I will share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan. The House will be aware of the significant announcements and developments in recent weeks about students returning to in-person learning and the arrangements for the State examinations in 2021. When I was last in this House, we were working intensively with education partners on both of these important objectives. I am happy that this work has ensured that we can move forward in the interests of students and school communities. Earlier this week, we saw the return of approximately 320,000 students to their classrooms. Some 60,000 are the leaving certificate class of 2021 and approximately 260,000 are in the first four years of primary school. This was a positive day for many students, their families and school staff, and one which has been much anticipated. Monday also saw special schools return to full in-class provision having operated on the basis of 50% attendance since 11 February. Special classes at primary and post-primary level have been operating at full capacity since 22 February. In total, this has seen the return of more than 18,000 children with special educational needs to the classroom. In line with the published phases of the return to in-class, in-person teaching over the next weeks, we hope to see even more students return to schools, including 260,000 primary school students in the more senior classes returning on 15 March together with fifth year students at post-primary level. Subject to continued progress in maintaining reduced community transmission levels, the remaining post-primary students return on 12 April following the traditional Easter break. The phased approach which has been building on the earlier phases when special schools and special classes reopened has been possible with the progress made across communities in bringing the community transmission levels of Covid-19 down. Like many Deputies, I was encouraged to see the Covid statistics being reported last night by the Department of Health, showing real and strong progress in the right direction. We need to maintain our efforts to contain the virus and I welcome the deputy chief medical officer's advice to school communities and more generally that we must stay vigilant so that we can get our students back to full in-school provision. Schools are planning for the coming phases and looking forward to welcoming all of their students back to their classrooms. We all have a duty and burden of responsibility to ensure that that will happen. I acknowledge that a phased reopening is challenging for many people, with children of different age groups in the same families returning at different times. The purpose of this cautious phased return is to continue to limit the mobility of the population and curb the spread of the virus. I ask all parents to review the symptoms of Covid-19 to ensure that children with symptoms do not attend school and that all children know and understand the procedures in place in school. This has been supported by a recent public health campaign. Please continue to abide by all social distancing regulations and stay at home apart from essential journeys. Please help schools by not congregating at the school gates. We all understand how essential school reopening is and we need to give it the best possible chance to get all students back as quickly as possible. We know that the Covid-19 pandemic has been challenging for children and adults alike and for this reason, the National Education Psychological Service, NEPS, has developed well-being webinars and toolkits for school staff. These contain information, guidance, tips and advice for schools on how to best support the well-being of all children and young people, including those with special educational needs, following this current period of Covid-19 school closures. NEPS has also produced and recently revised a targeted well-being resource, Supporting the Wellbeing of Students with Special Educational Needs Returning to School. NEPS psychologists have developed advice and guidance documents for parents and students to support the return to school, including advice on transition, coping and relaxation strategies, and managing stress and anxiety. Other resources for schools include guidance and advice for teachers to support students in the areas of behavioural regulation, managing stress and anxiety, as well as supporting teacher well-being and self-care. At local level, NEPS psychologists will continue to work with their assigned schools to support them to meet the needs of children and young people with a particular focus on those with the highest level of need as they settle back after this period of school closure. Before turning to the leaving certificate, I will address some important points about the reopening of our schools to avoid any confusion. The Department of Education has confirmed with public health services that the enhanced, augmented public health schools teams will be available to fully support schools that are opening in this interim phase. Full contact tracing and bulk fast-track testing in the school setting will resume immediately for schools as they reopen. Principals in a school where there has been a positive Covid-19 case will continue to have access to a dedicated phone line seven days a week. Close contact testing has resumed in the community. Close contacts will now be tested at day zero and again at day ten. If the second test results in no detection of the virus, then staff or students may return to school. Detailed data about transmission of Covid-19 within school settings will continue to be published and made available to my Department and stakeholders during this phase. The current public health advice is that serial antigen or PCR testing is not currently recommended as a public health measure to keep schools safe. This position is being kept under review by the HSE and an expert group is in place examining the use of antigen tests in schools and other workplace settings. I will continue to be guided by the advice of the public health authorities about all risk mitigation measures being implemented in the education sector. Revised Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, guidelines for SNAs published on 7 January 2021 recommend surgical grade masks for all SNAs. Schools must provide medical grade masks to all SNAs and teachers in special schools and special classes and those staff who, by necessity, need to be in close and continued proximity with pupils with intimate care needs, including school bus escorts.Schools may access the current PPE framework to procure the necessary PPE supplies. Funding is in place to support implementation of all infection prevention and control, IPC, measures, including all required PPE. There has been no reduction in that funding. A number of temporary measures have been implemented to support the phased reopening of schools, including putting in place temporary flexible accommodations for high-risk staff to work remotely or carry out duties where they are not in close contact or providing personal care. Pregnant teachers and SNAs were facilitated to work from home as part of these temporary arrangements while advice for pregnant education sector staff is developed by occupational and public health doctors. This week has also seen the return of the leaving certificate year students to their classrooms. They return with the clarity and choice the recent Government decision on the approach to be taken to their leaving certificate has provided. The work undertaken by the members of the advisory group on the State examinations in the lead-up to the Government decision was very beneficial in ensuring all voices could be heard and could have an input into the deliberations. Leaving certificate 2021 students are being offered a choice. They can sit the leaving certificate examination, receive grades accredited by the State Examinations Commission, SEC, to be known as SEC accredited grades, or both. Students can make this choice subject by subject. The candidate self-service portal will open next Wednesday, 10 March at 12 noon and will remain open until Tuesday 16 March at 6 p.m. Students will be asked to register on the candidate self-service portal and create their own account, confirm their subject entries and level and indicate whether they are taking the examination, opting for accredited grades, or both. Providing for both accredited grades and conventional examinations is essential to ensuring a fair system, having regard to the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and the loss of learning that has occurred for this group of students. The primary concern is to give students a choice and ensure they have a way to progress to further or higher education or on to work, recognising the particular circumstances of this year’s leaving certificate students. The work in ensuring students can choose to sit an examination or avail of an accredited grade continues intensively within my Department and the SEC and will involve continued engagement with the education partners. The House will be aware that A Guide to State Examinations and Accredited Grades for Leaving Certificate 2021 was issued by my Department last week. It provides detailed information for students, their families and schools as to how the examination and accredited grades strands will progress. Several members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science referenced specific elements of the guide at yesterday's meeting. Significant further information and guidance will be issued to students and schools over the coming weeks. There are differences to the arrangements in 2021 when compared with last year. First, a full suite of examinations operated by the SEC will be run, starting with the oral and practical components in the coming weeks, subject to prevailing public health advice. The examinations will take place in line with their traditional June timetable and that timetable has been published. The accredited grades system this year will ultimately be completed by the SEC, with my Department carrying out the preliminary stages of the work pending necessary legislative amendments. I intend to bring proposals for relevant legislative amendments to Cabinet shortly and to seek to have the relevant provisions drafted as a priority. Those provisions relate primarily to providing the necessary legal powers to the SEC, providing indemnity to teachers and schools and prohibiting the canvassing of teachers. I will be seeking the assistance of this House, the Seanad and the aforementioned Oireachtas committee in ensuring the relevant Bill can progress through the required legislative stages as expeditiously as possible. Across both Houses, I am sure we are united in our desire to see our leaving certificate class of 2021 progress to the next stages of their lives in as normal a fashion as possible, acknowledging the challenges they and the education system as a whole have faced and continue to face in the midst of a pandemic. I acknowledge the work undertaken across schools communities in recent weeks, particularly in the lead-up to yesterday, to ensure so many students are now back in their classrooms with their teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and support staff. I am looking forward to seeing all students back in their classrooms over the coming weeks. I now invite the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to address the House.	spk_160
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	The music exams will proceed. When we made our announcement we were clear that, to the greatest extent possible, oral and practical exams would be part of the written exams in June. There are three subject areas for which, on public health advice, will not be possible, namely, construction studies, engineering and physical education, PE. We have taken public health advice on all of this. The music exams will proceed but specific requirements need to be put in place because, as the Deputy will be aware, students do not always take an individual approach whereby one student is playing an instrument, singing or whatever. Sometimes they are in a group, whether big or small, so specific public health advice is being processed for that and will be made available as quickly as possible. Public health experts and the Department are working on that but it is positive that music exams will take place. As regards mock exams, the Department's guidance states they are neither recommended nor advised. Nevertheless, as the Deputy will appreciate, it has always been within the remit of schools to decide whether they would hold mock exams. Even prior to the pandemic, that autonomy has always rested with schools. We have advised in our guidelines that the maximum time be spent on in-class tuition and it is for that reason we have stated that they are neither recommended nor advised, although there is autonomy within schools in regard to mock exams, as always. On the issue of high-risk family members, we held a full review in recent weeks of practices and mitigation measures within schools prior to their reopening post January, carried out by public health experts. We have been assured that the mitigation measures that need to be in place are in place and that any additions that needed to be made have been made. There is an acknowledgement, which I heard again last weekend from Professor Philip Nolan and which has been articulated by the deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Ronan Glynn, that schools are places of low transmission, which brings me to another point relating to students. According to both national and international experience, students are best served when they are in the education sector. It is advised, therefore, that all students return to school and it is in their best interest to do so. Schools are places of low transmission and it is outside of them that there is cause for concern. Finally, on the issue of staff, the Deputy is correct that pregnant teachers are currently being afforded the opportunity to work from home. We are in a position to do that as there is a phased return to school and that will continue while we seek occupational health advice on how to progress. This has worked in other sectors as well. Once we receive the occupational health advice on the variety of parameters that can exist for different people, whether teachers, SNAs or whoever, who find themselves in that category, that information will be made available.	spk_163
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	On the issue of music, as I have articulated, we have made clear that music practical exams will continue but we are mindful that music has particular requirements and differing approaches are taken to the exam. It could be an individual exam or a group or an ensemble exam, or whatever it might be, so specific public health advice is required. We have previously taken public health advice and we need it subject-specific to the different mechanisms within music. That is progressing as expeditiously as possible and the decision will be available as a matter of priority. On mock exams, I again confirm that our guidelines clearly state they are neither recommended nor advised. They are not part of the curriculum, and while schools have the freedom to run mock exams or not, we have made clear that the priority for schools should be in-person tuition and that mock exams are not recommended nor advised.	spk_169
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	The Deputy is correct in saying we touched upon many of these issues yesterday at the committee and I thank him for that opportunity. Regarding resources for schools, in the interest of balance I must say the Government has shown incredible determination to resource education at a time, as the Deputy has correctly said, that is not normal; it is far from normal. It is definitely a Covid-19 environment. In that respect more than €629 million has been made available, which is an unprecedented investment to tackle Covid-19 issues in our schools. The Deputy spoke about a catch-up for students who have lost out in their education. I am very cognisant of that. The Department's inspectorate has done considerable work in garnering information on how it has impacted on students. The Deputy will be aware that on Monday I made a significant announcement about our DEIS schools with a one-point reduction in class sizes in the urban DEIS band 1 primary schools. In the previous budget I made significant progress in improving the pupil-teacher ratio for all schools. Regarding DEIS schools, I have extended the school completion programme, which is a very important programme for children in disadvantaged circumstances. We have included a further 28 schools in that respect. We have also increased funding for the school completion programme, and we have reduced the requirement from 700 to 600 to ensure additional deputy principals will be available in that environment. As I told the Deputy yesterday, we will expand summer provision for children to assist with numeracy and literacy. I hope as many schools as possible will take up that opportunity over the summer. We will continue to introduce as many measures as possible to mitigate lost learning time. I again confirm we have discussed what I have advocated clearly on vaccinations with the Department of Health on a number of occasions and we have formally written to it. We have asked for staff in the school community to be given particular consideration for vaccination. The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has undertaken a review of the leaving certificate senior cycle. To the best of my knowledge that is nearing completion and it is about to present those completed findings to me. That will be a springboard for further discussion and ultimate decision-making on the senior cycle. We are committed to a review of the calculated grades process, as it was then, on completion of the entire process. The last stage of that was the opportunity we afforded to students to take the written exam in November, the results of which issued in February. The appeals process for that is ongoing. The Deputy will also be aware that in some instances litigation is pending, notwithstanding the verdict yesterday. When all of that is completed, we are determined there will be a review.	spk_171
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	The Deputy raised the very important issue of well-being. I again confirm that this is a key priority for the Department. He will be aware that in the most recent budget, significant funding was made available for the provision of more than 110 guidance counsellors and 17 additional National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists.That is a statement of intent from the Department recognising the importance of the provision of these services within the education sector. Equally, in anticipation of the return to school in September and ongoing now, the Department's NEPS psychologist team has provided significant toolkits, webinars and support mechanisms, including technology, to schools in that regard. The NEPS psychology teams have been providing online support and, at this stage, on-site supports as well. We will continue to work in that regard. As stated by the Deputy, this is a significant consideration for our schools and the education sector.  In terms of vaccination, I confirm that as a Department we have had discussions with the Department of Health on a number of occasions. We have made formal representation to that Department and have also raised the issue at Covid-19 subcommittee presentations by Brian MacCraith and others. On the importance of principals, deputy principals, teachers, SNAs, school secretaries and caretakers and others who work in the school environment, I want to confirm that as things stand staff are within the top one third of those for vaccination roll-out but we have requested that there would be further improvement in that regard.	spk_173
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	On the point regarding the return to school, in this instance and since we reopened schools in September, we have abided by the advice of public health and NPHET. In this instance, it is their best advice that it should be a cautious and phased return to school, which I confirm again is largely due to the mobility of such a large number of people - 1.1 million. It was for that reason in the first instance schools were stood down. NPHET has confirmed that schools are places of low transmission. With the best will in the world, we would love to have everybody back as quickly as possible. There is a burden of responsibility on all of society to ensure we keep numbers and hospitalisations down. There is very positive news in that direction. People have done a tremendous job and we ask them to stick with that so that we can get children and young people back to school as quickly as possible. In regard to Tallaght Community School, I will confer with Deputy Duffy as we go forward. I know this is a matter of particular importance to him and that he has raised it on a number of occasions. I can assure him that my officials will be happy to meet with him on the matter going forward.	spk_179
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy for his questions. If I do not get the opportunity to respond to all the issues he raised, we will certainly revert to him.Certainly, the Department can revert to Deputy Gannon. I will first address the issue of mask-wearing for primary school students. The Deputy will appreciate that right from the beginning, as I have said on numerous occasions, from September to December through to now, everything we have done has been on the expert advice of public health officials. At any stage when they have asked us to put in place particular measures, whether halfway through or several weeks in or whatever, we have done so. One example was the wearing of masks for second level students. On their best recommendation that is what we did. They have not recommended mask-wearing for primary school children. Any child is of course free to wear a mask should he or she wish to do so. There is no equivocation on the issue. If it is the expert recommendation of public health officials, then that is exactly what we will do. However, as it stands it has not been their recommendation. I acknowledge that, as the Deputy is aware, there is an expert advisory group studying the whole issue of ventilation not only in school settings but in all work settings. The group is due to make recommendations in the short term. Prior to the return to school post Christmas we had a full review from a public health point of view of all the measures that were in place in schools, including measures in respect of ventilation. No further recommendations were made other than the recommendations outlined in the full guidelines. Should that change on foot of anything from the expert advisory group, we will be directed by that. Deputy Gannon made specific reference to the pupil-teacher ratio in classrooms and so on. I can confirm that, as the Deputy is aware, we successfully reduced the pupil-teacher ratio this year. It was an innovation of mine in the budget. I continue to look forward in that respect as well. I believe it is important we always continue to look at the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio where we can. The Deputy specifically raised issues around trauma, well-being and how children might be impacted by Covid-19. The National Educational Psychological Service of the Department is developing a range of workshops for the promotion of well-being and resilience in schools, and this includes trauma-informed approaches. The workshops will be available to build the capacity of school staff in primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders. These workshops will be piloted in schools in the coming months with a view to being rolled out in September as well.	spk_184
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	I will go as quickly as I can. I confirm to Deputy Flaherty that the DEIS identification model he referenced is currently being refined and worked through. There is significant investment in DEIS schools of more than €150 million every year. The Deputy articulated another very positive move yesterday in terms of DEIS schools and making specific funding available there, ensuring there is a one point reduction in the urban DEIS band 1 primary schools, that there would be an extension of the school completion programme, which is very important, an increase in funding for the school completion programme and, as I articulated earlier, a reduction from 700 to 600 in the number of students DEIS post-primary schools require for a deputy principal. In terms of the specific schools the Deputy mentioned, I am happy to follow up with him afterwards in relation to that. Specifically in relation to the schools Deputy McAuliffe mentioned, I am happy for the Department to confer with him. However, specifically on Clonturk Community College, I can confirm that I am aware that there was a technical assessment carried out in relation to that school and we will progress it from there. I know it is a key priority of the Deputy's, as indeed are the others. Deputy Cathal Crowe raised the phone lines for principals. The Covid-19 phone lines are operating on a seven-day basis and there are extended hours, to the best of my knowledge, until 8 p.m. However, I can confirm that and defer to the Deputy again in relation to it. Deputy Higgins raised the school building programme. I want to acknowledge that there is an ambitious school building programme ongoing this year. We have more than 200 schools that will be completed despite the pandemic and we have between 140 and 145 which will begin construction by mid-June to July of this year as well. I am happy to work with her in relation to the school buildings in her own area and it was remiss of me not to say that to Deputy Cathal Crowe. He has articulated on an ongoing basis about schools in his area and I will certainly follow up on this with him as will my officials.	spk_190
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	In the first instance, I appreciate the Deputy's acknowledgement that the return to school is a positive step. I think all of society regards it as a positive for students. All studies, both national and international, acknowledge that students do better when they are actually in school. On the issue of the acknowledgement of schools being safe, it is very important to point out that this is not a mantra of the Department of Education alone. I am sure the Deputy has heard many experts, including the deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Ronan Glynn, and Professor Philip Nolan, clearly articulating that schools in themselves are places of low transmission. When schools were stood down, it was because of a mobility issue in terms of 1.1 million people moving around in society rather than a reflection on what happens within schools or the mitigation measures that exist in schools. On the issue of mitigation measures in schools, a full review of all those measures that are currently in place in schools took place in advance of schools returning after Christmas. All of the measures that are required are in place. That has involved spending of in excess of €62 million on PPE and hand sanitiser and €52.2 million on ensuring there is enhanced cleaning from four to six hours per day in schools. All those mitigation measures have been highly complimented by all those who have an interest in what is happening within schools. On the issue of children with high-risk family members at home, I again refer to the national and international studies that tell us that children are best cared for when they are in school settings. I remind the Deputy that schools are places of low transmission. It is the recommendation of all the experts that children are served better when they are in school. Schools are places of low transmission. It is outside of the school setting that we must look to. I understand how difficult it can be for children with high-risk family members, but those children are best served by being in school.	spk_198
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	On the point made by the Deputy in respect of the leaving certificate, the NCCA is carrying out a review of the senior cycle. It is my understanding that the NCCA has almost completed the review. It is being refined and will be presented to me and the Department. We will study the review. It will be the springboard for further discussion and, ultimately, decision-making with regard to the senior cycle and all that it entails going forward. It is a very important body of work. Our experience with Covid-19 has in its own right been shining a light on the senior cycle. I anticipate that the report will be with me imminently. On the issue of the leaving certificate and access to third level, third level is not within my remit. It is within the remit of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris. All issues in respect of access to third level and places at third level are for his consideration. On the issue of the choice that is being made available to students this year, it is right and proper that students have the choice of an accredited grade system and also have the opportunity to take the written exam. I encourage all students to avail of that opportunity to the maximum extent possible. I think that is the best choice.	spk_200
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	"I thank the Deputies. Deputy Dillon asked about the leaving certificate examination and remote learning. I thank him for raising those issues and I appreciate this is an area of considerable concern to him. I acknowledge the work he has done in engaging through his survey of students and all of that. He is correct that it was most definitely the preference of students that there would be an opportunity not only for clarity on the leaving certificate examinations in 2021, but that there would also be choice. There will be an opportunity for students to opt for what this year we will call the ""accredited grade"" or the written exam. I hope as many as possible will take the option of the written exam. The choice mitigates the concerns of leaving certificate students about the loss of time and acknowledges that loss of time. Five months were lost last year, as were the two months after Christmas at the start of this year. In the broader context of remote learning, I acknowledge that terrific work has been done by teachers to bridge the gap when it was not possible to fully reopen schools. I also acknowledge, as teachers and school communities would also acknowledge, that students are best served when they are in school. Considerable efforts have been made and the situation has improved dramatically from the experience of March 2020.  Deputy O'Connor raised an issue about Carrigtwohill. I sincerely acknowledge that I know this is a matter of enormous interest to him and his constituents. It is an issue he has flagged on numerous occasions. I reiterate that it is a matter of high priority for my Department. I have clearly articulated to the Deputy on a number of occasions that we are working on it as a matter of priority. We will continue to place the highest priority on the delivery of accommodation in Carrigtwohill. Deputy Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of well-being. I acknowledge, as I did previously, that the issue of well-being is a matter of huge concern for the Department of Education. We made significant funding available for the provision of more than 110 additional guidance councillors and 17 National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists in the budget last year. During and after the lockdown, a significant number of webinars and well-being toolkits have been made available to schools. We have made training available for staff on the return to school to ensure that a positive well-being approach is being taken to the Covid-19 experience. I acknowledge that the well-being approach, even outside the context of Covid, has always been a priority within schools. I confirm to the Deputy that there is absolutely no shortage of funding for personal protective equipment, PPE. There have been no cuts to funding for PPE and, in fact, in excess of €61 million is being made available for the provision of PPE. I confirm that the DEIS identification model is close to refinement. It is an important aspect of the education sector. As the Deputy said, there can also be disadvantage in other schools. The matter is progressing and the model is being refined."	spk_204
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	Deputy Tóibín raised an issue about the leaving certificate. I want to make clear that guidelines have been sent to schools about all aspects of the leaving certificate with dates for oral examinations and coursework. It has all been made clear to schools. For example, oral examinations will take place between 26 March and 15 April. The final assessments for the accredited grades process will be completed by 14 May. It has been clear that music, oral examinations and other work have been proofed by public health services. We have made it clear that there are only three areas where such assessment cannot take place, due to public health advice, including construction studies, engineering and physical education. We have made it clear that music examinations are taking place. As I said earlier, there are a number of aspects to music and students have an option to do an individual performance where it a vocal performance or they are playing an instrument, or there might be an ensemble or larger group. Further public health advice about that is pending. I can come back to the issues raised by Deputy Canney. Both the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I have met with the parents of pupils at Rosedale School. I have spoken with the principal of Rosedale, who was well acquainted with the issues facing it for the leaving certificate in 2022. Considerable accommodation and work was provided for the 2021 leaving certificate. That has stood us in good stead this year, with alterations to papers, latitude for coursework and project work, and a similar opportunity will be availed of for the 2022 leaving certificate and in future.	spk_211

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-03-03	dail	33	Reopening Schools and Leaving Certificate Examinations: Statements	dbsect_9	No, but the Deputy's question concerns making specific funding available to schools and in the last year some €100 million was made available to schools. In December 2020, some €50 million was made to schools. That was ideally with the notion that schools, as I have seen on the ground myself, would then be able to purchase laptops and tablets, or whatever the facility might be, which could be loaned out and made available to students. That initiative has worked very successfully. The money could also be used for other platforms and equipment needed within schools. No student should be lacking access to laptops or tablets or whatever is needed because those resources should be in the schools and be able to be loaned out, as I have seen operating in many schools.	spk_227

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	I thank the House for the opportunity to address the issue of reopening in-school teaching and learning for students with special educational needs and to update Members on the efforts that have been made in this regard since I spoke here last week.  When I was in the House last Thursday, I outlined the following points, which are worth repeating:School, and education more broadly, is a hugely powerful and positive force in our young people's lives and it is vital that this is preserved for our students in these most challenging times and circumstances. International organisations, including the World Health Organization, WHO, and the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, have outlined the negative impact of school closure on children's health and well-being, as has the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI. For many children, school is not only a place of learning but also provides opportunities for social and personal development, healthy eating and physical activity. As the research of New Zealand education expert, Mr. John Hattie, has shown, school can be a hub of response and recovery, a place to support emotional recovery and promote social togetherness and this is as important as any academic gains.  It is for all of these reasons that Government and the Department of Education have invested heavily in schools to support them throughout this pandemic.  The Government and I are conscious of the particular strain that school closures place on children with special educational needs and their families. Research led by Dr. Carol Barron from DCU's school of nursing, psychotherapy and community health found that during the last period of school closures, children with special needs were suffering from a lack of routine, with the disruptions to their daily routines having a significant negative impact on them. Many children experienced regression during this period of social isolation and this negatively impacted their mental health.  In many families, that earlier period of closure was a traumatic and deeply stressful time for children, their parents and their siblings. A survey by Inclusion Ireland in May 2020 found that:Educating at home is not working well for most respondents to Inclusion Ireland's survey. There are huge barriers to educating at home for parents, who are not teachers in most cases.Parents specifically found it challenging to provide education to children with special educational needs while also trying to work from home, work on the front line and isolate at home, or care for other children or elderly adults. It is for all of these reasons and more that the Department has prioritised the reopening of schools and classes for children with special educational needs. As Deputies will all be aware, the Department and I have engaged intensively with all stakeholders to realise this shared ambition.  As I have stated many times before in this House and in other fora, collaboration is at the heart of all that we do in the education system, and this has never been more evident than at the present moment. Over the past year, since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, there have been unprecedented levels of engagement between the Department of Education and stakeholders. It was in this spirit of co-operation and engagement that the Department approached the vital goal of reopening schools for children with special educational needs. It is worth noting that between 4 January and this Tuesday, there have been engagements between unions and myself or senior officials on a near-daily basis. All of those meetings were focused on the safe reopening of schools. In more recent days, they were particularly focused on the more specific question of reopening special schools on a phased basis. As I said, there has been near-daily contact with stakeholders in this time period.  Before I spoke in the House last Thursday afternoon, I attended a meeting with the primary education stakeholders, including representatives of parents, teachers, special needs assistants, school management bodies and principals. Following on from that meeting, and the many engagements which had preceded it, all stakeholders agreed that we would work together towards the shared objective of a staged reopening of special and primary schools for children with special educational needs.  Consequently, the Department wrote to special schools and primary schools on 14 January, addressing concerns in regard to a phased reopening of primary and special schools for children with significant additional needs being planned for this week. The issues addressed included advice on school safety measures, risk management, school transport and childcare.  On 15 January, the Department wrote to special schools and primary schools setting out details of the framework under which it is intended that in-school teaching and learning would take place in special schools, special classes in mainstream primary schools and for pupils with special educational needs who attend mainstream classes in primary school. This guidance was agreed with the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and Fórsa.  The measures set out provide for: the return of pupils in special schools to school, attending on alternate days; pupils in special classes in mainstream primary schools to attend every day; and pupils with significant additional needs in mainstream classes in primary schools to have access to in-school teaching and learning in special education teaching groups. As we are all regrettably aware, it has not been possible so far to secure agreement for a partial reopening of schools for children with special needs. Both the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I will continue to engage with stakeholders to achieve an early return to in-school teaching and learning for this priority group of children. At a webinar for school stakeholders attended by more than 16,000 teachers, SNAs and school staff, public health doctors, while acknowledging that, at present, the mobility of 1.1 million people in the education sector would not be advisable, reiterated that schools are safe places for both students and adults because of the mitigation measures now in place, which include guidance on social distancing, mask wearing, hand hygiene, cleaning and school transport. This event provided an opportunity for teachers and SNAs to ask questions about the return to in-person learning for children with special educational needs and the public health considerations in that regard. The webinar restated the message from our public health experts that schools are safe for staff and pupils and built on the confidence in our schools concerning the virus and the management of the risks associated with it. Among the topics covered at the webinar were the safety of a school return at present, taking into account the latest information regarding the new variant and the present rate of community infection. In this context, specific reference was made to the experience of childcare facilities to date in 2021. The available data from January 2021 tell us that childcare facilities had a close-contact positivity rate of 3.2%, compared with a rate in the community in the high teens. In the year to date, the close-contact positivity rate for all schools has been below that of childcare facilities.  Also covered was the enhanced public health schools teams, which are being further enhanced by the Department of Education. Close contacts, testing and tracing were also discussed, in respect of which measures will continue for schools. I wish at this point to express my appreciation to our public health experts, who have given so freely of their time and expertise. I was somewhat taken aback by some commentary around their role in recent days, which sought to cast aspersions on their advice. I want to acknowledge their immense professionalism, integrity and sense of public service, which have been of huge value to the education sector and to our society and country as a whole. Unions have raised further concerns regarding high-risk staff and childcare arrangements. In response, the Department set out to the unions how it would address those concerns. Proposed measures included putting in place temporary flexible accommodations for high-risk staff to work remotely or carry out duties where they are not in close contact or providing personal care.These temporary arrangements were possible only because of the very significant reduction in the number of children on site under the proposed phased reopening. Pregnant teachers and SNAs were given the concession to work from home as part of these temporary arrangements while advice for pregnant education sector staff was to be developed by occupational and public health doctors. Furthermore, education staff, particularly those on lower incomes, would be eligible for childcare subsidies from the national childcare scheme. I want to assure the House that every effort is being made to work with school management and unions in a collaborative way so children can return to school safely as soon as possible. As I have said, intensive engagement has taken place with all stakeholders, including unions representing teachers and SNAs, namely INTO and Fórsa. This included intensive engagement with public health officials. It should be noted that the plan to accommodate children with additional needs had considerable support among Opposition members and, indeed, was called for within and outside this House. The Government paused plans for reopening on 6 January as the education partners were expressing concerns regarding the proposed reopening on that date. The Minister of State responsible for special education and inclusion and I have been listening to those concerns. We engage intensively with stakeholders, public health officials and disability advocacy groups to address these concerns. The recent intensive engagement has not just been between the Department of Education and union representatives. The Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I have been engaging with disability representative bodies and parental representative bodies in regard to how children with special educational needs can best be supported during the current school closure period. It is important to provide in-person learning to this vulnerable cohort of children and I regret that to this point it has not proved possible. The needs of this group of students are such that no one should be in any doubt about the importance of this goal and its urgency. We all understand how vulnerable these children are and how much they need to be in school. The concerns and fears of teachers and SNAs have been well-articulated. I understand and appreciate that this is a time of heightened anxiety for all in society, including those in the education sector. I say that sincerely. This is a challenging and difficult time and we are listening carefully. Public health advice for the education sector has at all times underpinned our approach to keeping schools safe and operational. Public health experts continue to advise that with the appropriate measures in place, we can support the reopening of special schools, special classes and in-person learning for certain children with special educational needs in mainstream schools. Ireland is now an outlier in the European Union in not having in-person provision for students with special educational needs at this time. We have addressed the concerns raised in relation to safety, including making public health officials available to education partner representatives and subsequently facilitating three of the most senior public health officials in the country to communicate directly with teachers and SNAs. The Department has consistently accepted and acted on the knowledge, advice and expertise of public health experts. This is the first time that unions have refused to accept that advice. We have provided guidance on how special schools can operate at 50% capacity to offer the students a return to learning. We have provided guidance and flexibility in regard to staff members who are at high risk of Covid-19 to ensure their safety. We have put in place flexible arrangements for schools to manage this situation, return to in-person learning and to organise and manage their staffing in this context. Our clear focus, today, tomorrow and always, is on getting children and young people with special educational needs back into their classrooms. Work to achieve that is continuing assiduously. I know that Deputies across the House share this objective. I welcome their positive co-operation and contributions in the House today.	spk_327

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	The Deputy has made an assertion that there was no planning here. There have been considerable plans put in place, all of them backed to follow public health advice. As public health advice dictates, we follow the plans as available. There has been no ambiguity there. Plan A, on foot of public health advice, was to reopen our schools, which we did successfully from September to December. Plan B, if that was not possible, involved considerable planning in terms of guidance and adjudication for schools in terms of how to manage remote teaching and learning. That was agreed guidance after considerable engagement with all unions and stakeholders. That guidance has admitted. Plan C outlined that if there was to be a partial return, the priority was to be given to the core group the Deputy mentioned, namely, children with additional needs. I refer to the 40% cut that the Deputy and others in his party have made liberal reference to. There is no 40% cut in terms of personal protective equipment, PPE. The difference in moneys being made available in this term are as follows-----	spk_333
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	I am not. This is very important because the Deputy, his leader and many others have made assertions about this and it is important to correct the record. In the instance of PPE, in the first term there was considerable additional funding made available for start-up costs which included putting in place hand sanitiser, equipment in places, additional bins and all of that.	spk_335
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	If the Deputy allows me to finish. Equally so, the first term was 25% longer than the present term so there is no cut. I refute that absolutely 100%. The provision of PPE is as it should be and we have always said if there was more required, it would be given. On serial testing, on foot of public health recommendations, if that is required, we will follow public health advice. On vaccination, we made representations that our school communities would be part of that. We have made further representation and there is discussion on that. Finally, on the Deputy's assertion that there was no consultation and a rushed plan in relation to Thursday, I say to him that was on foot of intensive discussion and negotiation. It was also as a result of agreement at the stakeholder meeting. To illustrate it was a shared objective, this day last week the Irish National Teachers' Organisation general secretary, John Boyle, said he believed that every single school in Ireland would be opening their doors late in the following week for children with additional needs. It was a shared objective and there was nothing rushed about it.	spk_337

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	I asked for ten seconds to reply. I do not have sufficient time to reply in full because the clock will not allow me, but I want to make one point. The Deputy quite correctly asserted that I have encouraged people to pick sides and that I have picked sides. I make no apology. I picked the side and will continue to pick the side of children with additional needs. They are my first priority. The Deputy made an assertion and I have clarified the matter.	spk_357
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	The Deputy should be under no illusions that at every stage and every step I, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Department have taken a collaborative approach. When talks have not worked out, I have always committed to re-engagement at the earliest of opportunities and that is exactly what is happening at present. The issues raised by the Deputy are similar to those raised by his colleague, to which I already replied. There is no such thing as a 40% cut in PPE. It seems to be an issue that despite the clarifications and clear information that has been given, certain individuals continue to perpetuate that untruth. I will reiterate once again that the 40% we were talking about was for start-up costs in terms of the provision of PPE, which included roll-out costs of putting in hand sanitiser units, additional furniture that might be required in schools, signage and whatever else. Additional moneys were made available for that. Equally, additional moneys were made available because the first term was 25% longer than this present term. Therefore, when one takes all that into consideration there is absolutely no cut in the PPE funding. There was never a question of funding for PPE or otherwise. The Deputy will appreciate that more than €639 million has been expended. It is the highest budget of money for any remediation and mitigation purposes in our schools and has been made available freely. There has never been a question of resources. In terms of serial testing, I say quite clearly to the Deputy that we have followed the public health advice at every step of the way. Should the public health team request that, we will certainly do it. Every time it has asked for a new introduction of measures, we have done that. The Deputy raised childcare and other issues in terms of his community. I know exactly how the communities are feeling. Communities want to see children with additional needs back in schools. As I said in my opening remarks, I appreciate this is a time of high anxiety for everyone. I come from a family that is heavily invested in the education sector and carries out a variety of different roles. I know exactly how they are feeling but I also know they are fully committed to making education available to children with additional needs. I will work constructively, as will the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to ensure that happens.	spk_361

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	I have the floor now. The Deputy has made an assertion that I do not listen and that I have taken credit for the reopening of schools. If the Deputy was assiduously listening, and if the Deputy had this particular interest in schools and what was happening in schools from September right up to December, she would know that at every opportunity in this House and outside I have said quite clearly that the successful and sustained reopening of our schools was due largely, in huge measure, to the magnificent and generous work of school communities the length and breadth of this country. I have never deviated from that view. On the work of teachers and SNAs, I have worked for long and many years in the education sector alongside SNAs. I regard them as valuable and valued partners in the education sector. I see at first hand what they have done. That is why I appreciate the collective approach. Indeed, as I said, I recognise that when things do not work out it is necessary to engage and re-engage repeatedly. That has always been my process and I do it now.	spk_374
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	On the questions that the Deputy has raised, I have answered every one of them that has been put by the Deputy's colleague. Indeed, it is interesting that the Deputy repeats the questions and does not seem to grasp the answers.	spk_376
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	It is interesting that Deputy Bríd Smith referred to issues that she claimed have been ongoing for ten and 12 years. I remind the Deputy that this Government has been in place for six months. Within that six months with regard to the commitment and the determination to progress special education, we have a budget in excess of €2 billion. The largest and most significant budget ever for special education has been provided by this Government. That is a strong statement of intent on the importance that we place on special education. I hope when the Deputy speaks that she is cognisant of that. I also hope she would be cognisant that, even in these current difficult circumstances for everybody, particular consideration is being given to providing educational services for children with additional needs. That again is testament to the determination of the Government to cater for the needs of children with additional needs and all those who fall into the special education sector. Although this is a debate on special education, Deputy Barry raised specific issues around the leaving certificate. I want to be very clear. Since 27 June, all of my negotiations and engagements have been with the representative bodies, including the student representative body. At every stakeholder engagement that I have had and every conversation about students, I have always and consistently listened and engaged with the president of the students union. I will continue to do that. Tomorrow the students are making a presentation at the advisory committee. The Deputy should be under no illusion. I have worked long years in the education sector, particularly with senior students at leaving certificate level. They are a priority. I value them and I respect them to the extent that I always engage with their representative body.	spk_386

I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for his considerate, insightful and, indeed, measured contribution.I believe the Deputy is 100% correct, and it has been articulated by Deputy O'Donnell, that there is only one agenda here and it is to find a way forward for all of our children, in this instance children with additional needs in particular. I absolutely believe there is a shared objective, and I say this with the greatest of respect to all of the Deputies here. I believe it is their shared objective also as, indeed, I believe it is the shared objective of the partners in education, and I include all of the voices that have been mentioned, including the teacher unions, the unions representing special needs assistants, the managerial bodies and everyone as a collective. The Deputy asked what exactly we are going to do now. What we are doing is maintaining the fact that priority must be given to children with additional needs. The Deputy referred to public health and absolutely everything in the best interests of everyone who is part of the school community, including those who are working in the school community and the children themselves, has always been underpinned by public health advice. The Department of Education and I have never deviated from public health advice. We will not deviate from public health advice now and whatever we are asked to do in terms of public health advice in the best interests of everybody who works in the education sector and the children we will do. Once again, we are in discussion with everyone concerned and we will continue to discuss, engage and encourage, all of us working collectively to find suitable resolution. I know we are all committed to doing that.	spk_389
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy. I acknowledge her very positive and constructive contribution this evening and, indeed, her positive and ongoing positive contribution to every debate on the education sector. I would say, given that the Deputy referred to the concern among teachers, SNAs and others working in the school community, that I know those concerns. I engage on an ongoing basis with the representatives of all of the people of whom we speak, but I also engage on a personal level with teachers, SNAs, school secretaries and caretakers - you name it. This is the community where I come from. These are the people I know. I know, when the Deputy says there is not a teacher or an SNA who does not want to go back to work, that this is 100% correct. I also know we are living in a society with heightened concerns. However, I want to assure them that, as I have said from the outset, I will always follow the public health advice. I have followed it, as have the Department of Education and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, since September right through to December. I am following that now as they have told us that schools are controlled environments and that they have confidence we can provide for children with additional needs in these settings. We are talking about 18,000 students out of a population of 1 million and many classes have just six pupils. I follow the public health advice. I have the interests of all within the education sector at heart.	spk_393

To clarify the question of announcements first and discussions next, all discussions have taken place first and announcements have then been made, and they have been done collaboratively. When the Department has made announcements, similar announcements have been made by those who have been at the table also. In terms of the results from the November 2020 exams, that will be in early February. Reference was made to the leaving certificate. The process is moving forward and there is another meeting of the advisory group. The contingencies that are already in place remain in place but further plans are being assessed.	spk_396

These are individuals who volunteer and generously give so much of their time. I acknowledge their contribution as well and that of the entire community, which the Deputy also referred to. The Deputy referred to those who work in school transport. Again, I have always appreciated that it is very much the collective and the community in education. This is our priority. The Deputy mentioned moving forward with safety for all. That is exactly the view we are taking and we have always taken. It is safety for all in the education sector.	spk_398
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	I thank the Ceann Comhairle and appreciate his indulgence. I again note that I was not given the facility to reply by the Deputies. To Deputy Pringle, I say that after five months of school closures, from March to August, there was a view, shared by the Deputy and others, that it would not be possible to reopen the schools. In my Ministry, we delivered the reopening of schools after five months of closure. It was delivered because of considerable resources - €639 million - but also, largely and more importantly, and I recognise this and will consistently recognise it, because of the generous goodwill of school communities throughout the country. I knew it was right then to reopen the schools for the benefit of children with additional needs and all our children in education. It was the right thing to do then and it is the right thing to do now, in the midst of this wave of the pandemic, to ensure that children with additional needs are facilitated in the education sector. I will consistently work with all in the education sector to ensure that we deliver that. I am conscious of what is right. I know what is right and I will ensure that we will work collectively and consistently to deliver what is right. I appreciate what Deputy Connolly said. I have spoken before about this Government's priorities. It, unlike many others, has provided a budget of €2 billion for the education of children with additional needs, giving it the importance it deserves and the priority it should and must deserve.	spk_402
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-21	dail	33	Covid-19 (Special Educational Needs Provision): Statements	dbsect_9	There is no question around the intent of this Government to deliver for children with additional needs.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	I am pleased to be before the House to set out the work that myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, as well as our officials and indeed, the partners in education, have been engaged in over recent weeks to ensure the continued provision of education to our students throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. While schools are providing remote education at present, the resumption of in-person teaching and learning is a priority for Government and intensive engagement continues with the partners in education to do so as soon as possible. Just this morning, I convened a meeting of stakeholders from the primary and special schools sector. We are working together towards a staggered return for children in special schools and a return to school for those in special classes in primary schools and children who access special educational needs, SEN, supports in mainstream primary classes beginning on 21 January next. Schools will also have discretion to accommodate their most vulnerable students. I wish to acknowledge the engagement and work of all of the partners in education so that we are in a position to move forward in this direction from 21 January for the benefit of all of our children with additional needs. We also continue to work together to set out a pathway for the return of all children at all levels of schooling, subject to Government and public health consideration of what constitutes the safe movement of people. My officials continue to engage closely with senior public health specialists in this respect and direct communications in the coming days through webinars, videos for parents and written FAQs will supplement the significant levels of information and guidance available. Since taking office, this Government has made the provision of education its priority. School, and education more broadly, is a hugely powerful and positive force in our young people's lives and it is vital that this is preserved for our students in these most challenging times and circumstances. International organisations, including the World Health Organization, WHO, and the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, have outlined the negative impact of school closure on children's health and well-being, as has the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI. For many children, school is not only a place of learning but also provides opportunities for social and personal development, healthy eating and physical activity. As the research of New Zealand education expert, Mr. John Hattie, has shown, school can be a hub of response and recovery, a place to support emotional recovery and promote social togetherness and this is as important as any academic gains.  It is for all of these reasons that Government and the Department of Education have invested heavily in schools to support them throughout this pandemic. In total, a package in excess of €437 million has been provided to schools to support their continued operation.Funding has been provided for the employment of replacement teaching staff, special needs assistants, SNAs, and administrative staff, as well as for an additional 1,080 teaching posts at post-primary level. This includes 120 guidance posts, which have been provided to support student well-being. Provision has also been made to provide primary schools with additional substitute staff. In addition, significant additional measures are being adopted to increase the supply of teachers at both primary and post-primary level.  There has been a €75 million capital allocation to support schools to prepare their buildings and classrooms for reopening, including an uplift for schools with pupils with special educational needs, and €4.2 million to enable schools to employ aides to implement measures to deal with the logistical challenges schools face at this time, such as moving furniture, changing classroom layouts, setting up hand sanitiser stations and signage and everything else that is involved in schools' preparations with regard to the Covid-19 pandemic. An additional €52 million has also been provided to schools to put in place enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission in schools.  The package also made additional provision for special schools and special classes in recognition of the particular challenges these schools and classes face in dealing with children with complex medical and care needs. From a public health perspective, national data on the Covid-19 positivity of close contacts since schools reopened in September are reassuring. Schools have not been identified as amplification settings for the infection, meaning that transmission rates within our schools are low. In his letter on 5 January, the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, noted that the majority of cases of Covid-19 infection in children and adolescents occurred outside the school setting during September and through to December. This is in spite of the significant proportion of their time that children and young people spent in schools during this time period. All of the evidence shows that, through the hard work and dedication of school communities, supported by the Government, and through the resources provided to schools by the Department of Education, schools can and do operate safely. We are all aware of the importance to children of keeping schools open. Nonetheless, last Thursday, the Government took the difficult decision to close schools to all students, pending further discussion with our partners in education. This followed a week of engagement between the education stakeholders, my Department and me. Last Monday, my officials and I met education stakeholders to discuss the planned reopening of schools on 11 January and to seek their views. My officials updated education partners on the latest public health advice available from NPHET and on their own engagement with public health experts earlier that day, both of which advised that a full reopening of schools on 11 January was safe from a public health perspective. At this briefing, a number of stakeholders shared their view that in the event of any school closures, specific accommodation should be made for certain cohorts of students, most notably students with additional needs and leaving certificate students. Interestingly, this was reiterated by many of the spokespersons on education at my meeting with them on the evening of Monday, 4 January. The following day, the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, Dr. Tony Holohan, wrote to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. In his letter to the Minister for Health on 5 January, the CMO advised that it was his view that while the experience in schools to date had clearly demonstrated that schools are, in themselves, a safe environment, the epidemiological situation had deteriorated to a point at which the significant levels of mobility and linked activity that the full reopening of schools would generate might pose an additional risk. In his letter, the CMO stated categorically that this advice was not based on a changed assessment of the risks in relation to transmission levels in schools. Rather, it was a reflection of the overall epidemiological situation and the absolute need to reduce mobility and movement within the community. On foot of this advice, on Wednesday, 6 January, the Government made the difficult decision to close all schools with limited exceptions for children attending special schools and special classes and to facilitate partial attendance for leaving certificate students. Given what we know regarding the impacts of school closures on children and young people, this was not a decision that Government took lightly. It was clear, however, that the public health situation required a strong response which minimised movement to the greatest extent possible. Under usual circumstances, the daily school run involves nearly 1 million students, 100,000 members of staff and, of course, a significant number of parents and guardians. Two limited and targeted exceptions were made, namely, for students with special education needs and for students in their final year of school. Students with special education needs were prioritised to receive in-person education as many students with special educational needs struggled immensely during the last period of school closure, experiencing considerable distress and loss of learning. This was also a challenging time for the parents, guardians and families of children with special educational needs. Furthermore, students in their final year of the leaving certificate cycle were prioritised for in-person teaching and learning to provide them with valuable confidence in the lead-up to their final examinations. These two limited accommodations were made while remaining mindful of the need to reduce movement within the wider community. On Thursday, Dr. Kevin Kelleher, assistant national director of the HSE and member of NPHET, and Dr. Abigail Collins, public health specialist, facilitated a briefing for education stakeholders on the Government decision to reopen schools on a limited basis for children with special educational needs and leaving certificate students. In a meeting lasting over two hours, Dr. Kelleher and Dr. Collins reiterated their belief that schools are safe environments and that it was safe for both students with special educational needs and leaving certificate students and staff to operate schools at this time, utilising the preventative measures that are in place. Nonetheless, shortly after this briefing on Thursday, a number of stakeholders expressed their clear opposition to this plan and the Government took the decision to pause the limited reopening of schools pending further engagement with all partners in education. Our renewed engagement with partners began the very next day and on Friday, my officials and I met with parents, students, unions, management bodies and principal networks. On Monday, 11 January, together with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, I met representatives of Down Syndrome Ireland, Family Carers Ireland, Inclusion Ireland and AslAm. These representatives brought with them the lived experience of students with special educational needs and their families and they were united in their view that remote provision simply does not work for many children with special educational needs. For these families, school is not just a building but a place to belong and to be accepted and a safe environment in which to thrive. All of these representatives expressed their very clear concerns regarding the impact of school closures on their children and young people. I share their concerns and my Department and I have continued intensive engagement with representatives of students, parents, teachers, SNAs, principals, and management bodies to discuss the best path forward for our children with special educational needs and for those in greatest need. As I mentioned earlier, I am pleased to have made significant progress towards our goal in this regard. Following near-daily engagement with key stakeholders in the primary and special school sectors, we are working together towards a staggered return for children in special schools and a return to school for those in special classes in primary schools and children who access special educational need supports in mainstream primary classes, beginning on 21 January. We continue to engage with primary and post-primary stakeholders to work toward our ultimate goal of a return to school for all students. I am pleased to note that the Minister for Social Protection has continued funding for the school meals programme at this time to enable school meals provision to continue. This mirrors the arrangements that were in place during the school closures in 2020, when the vast majority of schools in the school meals programme put arrangements in place to ensure that pupils most in need continued to receive food parcels. I am very grateful for the efforts of school principals, staff and all who work to make this possible.Schools are being asked, where feasible, to make arrangements to continue with the provision of the school meals programme through a delivery model that suits their individual needs best. Community and voluntary support is also available to schools through the local authority community support network programmes to assist with deliveries. Contact information for these supports has been provided to all schools. Significant work is also being carried out by school communities during this period of closure to ensure the learning of all students is supported at this time. As a contingency measure for the possibility of partial or full school closures, the Department has provided a suite of guidance materials to help schools to support pupils and students learning remotely. Guidance has already been provided to all schools and agreed with the education partners advising all schools of the requirement to provide for the continuity of teaching and learning in the event of school closures. This guidance was first circulated to schools in the initial period of school closure, and was subsequently reviewed and agreed with the partners in education. Final guidance in respect of primary and special schools was published in October 2020 and final guidance in respect of post-primary schools was published in December 2020. In accordance with this guidance, schools should seek to provide regular engagement with pupils and students. In a primary setting this should, ideally, be on a daily basis; in a post-primary context, teachers should, as far as possible, engage with students as per the normal timetable. There should be a blend of guided and independent learning tasks and experiences. Remote teaching should involve both direct teaching by the teacher and the assignment of independent learning tasks for completion by the students. There should be appropriate and engaging learning opportunities. Teachers should ensure that the chosen learning tasks give pupils and students an opportunity to demonstrate their learning in a clear and concise way. Regular opportunities for feedback should be given to students. Schools should ensure that two-way feedback between teachers and parents and guardians is encouraged and supported. Schools should provide manageable and accessible opportunities for all pupils to regularly share samples of their work with the teachers throughout each week. Teachers should ensure that work received is corrected and relevant feedback is provided. Support for SEN pupils involves special education teachers continuing to engage with the pupils on their caseloads. Class or subject teachers should differentiate teaching and learning in line with their pupils' needs to minimise disruption to their learning and progression. Further guidance to schools in respect of children with special educational needs and students experiencing educational disadvantage has also issued. Planning for leaving certificate examinations in 2021 and consideration of all the issues arising is under way by the State Examinations Commission, SEC, and my Department. This work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders, which includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service. The advisory group meets regularly, and I am committed to continuing to meet, consult and engage with this stakeholder group on all matters relating to examinations. The advisory group is considering all the various issues regarding the holding of the 2021 examinations, including the issues emerging relating to public health, and will continue to do so. All partners are committed to acting in the interests and well-being of students, who are at the heart of this process. A number of adjustments to assessment arrangements have already been made at leaving certificate and junior certificate level, taking account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019-20 school year and further possible loss of learning time in the 2020-21 school year as a contingency measure. The adjustments play to students' strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. There will be no change to the length of the written examinations. I am aware that some from the student cohort have called for the examinations to be curtailed, delayed or perhaps even cancelled with others suggesting that alternatives should again be used in 2021. Let me be clear on this point; my Department and I are listening to the students on this and to the other stakeholders involved. The advisory group has met several times already and a further meeting is planned shortly. My Department is continuing to engage in direct bilateral consultation with stakeholders this week, including student representatives. The Department engaged directly with the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, ISSU, on Tuesday evening, and I spoke briefly with Reuban Murray, the president of ISSU, yesterday evening. In addition, a meeting with ISSU is scheduled for tomorrow morning. The Government has also prioritised continued operation of school-related construction sites, as this is critical to enable the State to sustain the operation of schools in the current academic year and to deliver additional school accommodation requirements that arise in September 2021 to meet mainstream and SEN school places requirements. These are very difficult times and difficult decisions and choices needed to be made. I am very grateful for the co-operation and leadership that the entire school community has shown in working together to enable education provision to continue safely and effectively during the September to December term. We hope to see the virus coming back under control and being more manageable as we move into spring and summer. My focus is on working to get schools open and to sustain this opening through until the end of term, working with our partners and with public health. When I met Opposition spokespeople last week, several Deputies indicated that they wished to work collaboratively as we face the challenges currently before us. I thank them for that. As public representatives, we can ensure that how we face the challenges is informed by the broadest range of views and perspectives and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies. I again express my thanks to all in the education sector, including the Opposition spokespersons, for their ongoing work and support for all the children and young people we serve in the education sector.	spk_90
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	I thank the Deputy for the issues she highlighted. I must differ with her, however, regarding many of the points she made. The Deputy referred to a lack of planning. That is absolutely and utterly untrue. I hope the Deputy is aware of the efforts being made by schools to ensure children are catered for in these current circumstances with remote and online learning. They are in a position to do that because of the extensive planning and engagement which has taken place to provide clarity and guidelines to schools concerning those elements. Moreover, in respect of guidance on remote and distance learning, guidelines for the continuity of learning were issued to schools earlier in the school term and then procedures agreed by all the partners in education were issued to schools. There has, therefore, been intense discussion and negotiation with everybody in the education system concerning providing consistent planning and guidelines for the situation in which we find ourselves. Schools adapted flexibly and resiliently during any short-term closures experienced between September and December and they are doing likewise now. There is also agreement where there is considerable oversight from the Department regarding how schools are faring in this respect. I reject out of hand, therefore, what the Deputy has said on this point. She is doing a disservice to the partners in education, including the teaching unions, the managerial bodies, the parents and students when she rejects the amount of time and effort they have put into planning for the closures we face now. Their work has been exemplary and I acknowledge their co-operation. Turning to the issue of special schools, we have made the announcement regarding those schools. The Deputy raised the specific issue of special classes and children in mainstream classes. Children in special classes and in mainstream schools are to be facilitated under this plan. I again acknowledge the incredible engagement of all the partners in education to achieve the shared objective of facilitating, on 21 January, the opening of the special schools, the special classes and children in mainstream schools. Provision has also been made for vulnerable students. On the leaving certificate aspect, I again take issue with the Deputy's comment on what I would have learned if I had spoken to students. I deal with students on an ongoing basis. Students are very much anchored in all the discussions we have in the Department regarding any planning we do, whether that concerns schools reopening or examinations. The Irish Second–Level Students Union, ISSU, is represented at all those engagements. I have spoken with representatives from that organisation several times personally and in the context of stakeholder arrangements. I also spoke with the president of ISSU, Reuben Murray, yesterday. I am very well placed to deal with students. I have taught all my life in the education sector, I deal with students on a daily basis and am familiar with their needs and I absolutely reject the suggestion that students are not involved as part of the partners in the education process. They most certainly are. The Deputy also referred to projects and related matters. Guidance has issued on extended deadlines for projects and the extension now available is available because of the extensive planning, work and engagement with all the partners in education to ensure that leeway would be given regarding dates for the completion of projects. That leeway was given as students returned to school in September, and we are availing of that leeway now, again as a consequence of considerable planning.  Reference was then made by the Deputy to industrial relations issues concerning teachers and SNAs in respect of public health and guidance etc.. Measures regarding the conditions for those who work in the school community and for those students attending classes are all guided by public health advice. Whenever the public health authorities asked us to change our procedures or processes, we have done that, whether that concerned masks, schools transport etc.. We will continue to do that consistently. All measures which need to be in place to facilitate any aspect of the running of schools for any members of our staff will continue to be in place and will continue to be flexibly added to, changed or amended as required by the direction of public health authorities. 	spk_92
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	I am responding to both. I will take the opportunity to respond to Deputy Ó Ríordáin first. I acknowledge the engagement that has been forthcoming from the Opposition spokespersons on education, which I appreciate. On the specific point of consultation with the unions, I want to be very clear that I most definitely engaged with the unions on Monday of last week. I engaged with all the partners in education on their concerns and issues around the reopening of schools. Engagement with all the partners in education has been ongoing since I took up my ministerial post on 27 June. Had that engagement not been possible, we would never have achieved the reopening of our schools. The reopening of our schools was on the back of very considerable engagement, agreement and support within the partners in education for the processes that were being undertaken by the Department. On the issue of staff, teachers, SNAs and vaccinations, the Deputy will be aware that I initially raised this with regard to the need for the school community to be included on the priority list. I was very pleased when that actually happened. We have re-engaged with the task force in seeking consideration of the need for the school community, as front-line workers, to be accommodated as quickly and as urgently as possible. Those discussions will continue. On disadvantage, I acknowledge the Deputy's specific interest in the area and the many proposals he has brought forward in that regard.I think the Deputy will acknowledge that there has been considerable investment by the Department in terms of disadvantage-----	spk_96

On the case outlined by the Deputy, it is for all those reasons and more that specific provision for the cohort of children with additional needs and profound and severe difficulties is being made so they are facilitated in terms of lockdown. I am personally aware of the difficulties and complexities faced by these children and, in addition, by their families and guardians during the last lockdown. It is for all those reasons and more that the Government has been 100% committed to making particular accommodation for children with additional needs.	spk_102
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	A specific issue has been raised by Deputy Gannon in terms of numbers prior to December. Deputy Gannon has said that I consistently articulate that school is a safe environment. I articulate it because that is the evidence, wisdom and expertise of public health. It is those in public health who are confirming this to us. Deputy Gannon will be aware that Dr. Holohan references low transmission within our schools and he refers to schools being safe places. It is supported by Professor Philip Nolan, also a member of the National Public Health Emergency Team. Deputy Gannon will also be aware of the ongoing engagement with the expert professionals in terms of public health who we deal with in the schools. The deputy national director of public health, Dr. Kevin Kelleher, and the consultant in public health, Dr. Abigail Collins, have had personal experience of the surveying of our schools.	spk_109
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	I will finish this point.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	The Deputy asked about public health advice and the new variant. At all stages, public health advice officials offer their expertise. They do it mindful of all that is happening from an epidemiological point of view in terms of what we would call the virus as we knew it and the new variants, whether the UK variant or the South African variant. All of that is taken into consideration when they issue their advice. Mindful of that, on Monday, 4 January, prior to my meeting with all the partners in education, the public health officials made their advice available. They said they still regarded schools as safe places. Indeed, the Deputy has helpfully pointed out himself that Dr. Holohan made reference only to mobility in society. The Deputy has the letter to hand. Dr. Holohan specifically stated in that letter that at no stage did he revise his view that transmission was low in schools and that schools were safe places. He raised a question around large mobility. For that reason, it was on the basis of a mobility issue for all of society that the decision was taken to reduce the numbers and stand down a little over 900,000 people in the education sector. The public health advice we received on Monday, 4 January and what we have received again this week confirm to us that in the expert knowledge of public health officials in the context of all variants and otherwise, schools remain safe places. Consideration has been taken of all the various variants. I will point also to remarks I heard personally made by Dr. Cillian De Gascun in respect of the transmissibility of the variant. He suggested at that stage of the weekend that in his view, the transmissibility at that point - that is what was said - in terms of the new variant was not over-extensive or new in terms of young people.

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	Regarding the Deputy's remarks on lack of engagement, which I utterly reject out of hand, it has been the hallmark of my Ministry that substantial engagement right from the very beginning has been attested by the reopening of our schools and ongoing engagement with all the partners in education. This includes parents, teachers, students and managerial bodies right across the weave of education. I therefore reject out of hand the Deputy's remarks in that regard. Regarding school transport specifically, it is very clear that all those who were eligible and who paid on time have been facilitated. Deputy Carthy may or may not be aware of the reality of the Covid-19 situation, which has led to public health issuing advice on school transport. I reiterate, as I highlighted earlier, that everything we in the Department of Education have been asked to adhere to, including flexibility in terms of public health, we have done so. In adherence to public health, we have accepted the recommendation that we accommodate 50% on our school transport, and we are rolling that out. Where there is extra capacity, accommodation will be made, but we are abiding by public health in that regard. In the context of parents and families, again, I acknowledge that there has been ongoing representation and engagement. There is a parent voice, a parent representative, in all my engagements. I have facilitated that regularly and will continue to do so. It is hugely important. In the Department of Education and in the education sector we work as a collaborative, and I acknowledge the willingness of all the various partners in education to contribute positively.	spk_116

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. In the first instance, I will refer specifically to points that were raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett. I assure the Deputy, and I have articulated this previously, that every measure we have introduced into our schools is backed by public health advice and that we react immediately, taking account of the public health advice, in respect of any measures that schools ask us to change or to be flexible on. I ask the Deputy to be under no illusions in this regard. On the specific points raised by Deputy Barry, I have no knowledge whatsoever of the sources of the story that he referred to in a Sunday newspaper. I can categorically state that there was no engagement with me or my Department on any such stories. There is no veracity to this. I know of the challenges, difficulties and anxieties to which the Deputy refers and which leaving certificate students are facing. I know these very well. I have spent all of my professional life teaching students of all different levels, especially those in senior cycle. I know that the most difficult year for every student is that when he or she sits the leaving certificate. This is intensely even more the case now in the midst of the pandemic. We are listening very closely to all student voices. Students are well represented at all of our stakeholder engagements.	spk_124
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	I thank the Deputy and acknowledge his engagement with me on an ongoing basis in respect of education issues. As already stated, I understand the anxiety and difficulties of our leaving certificate students in particular. I acknowledge that their representatives are very much part of our advisory committee that is preparing for our leaving certificate, which has met on two occasions and which will meet again in the coming days. The committee is looking at all of the different measures that need to be put in place for the leaving certificate, including all of the contingencies involved, and at many of the issues raised by the Deputy. The approach taken will be collaborative. The Deputy must remember that there are many partners in the education sector, such as the teacher unions, parents, managerial bodies, and, very importantly, students. All of their views must be taken on board. I appreciate that there is not unanimity and that there is a variety of views. In the context of those with special educational needs, I acknowledge the tremendous work taking place in the special education sector. I also acknowledge that remote learning is not appropriate to all. For that reason, I welcome the very positive engagement with the partners in education to find a pathway forward in the next number of days towards 21 January and a resumption of face-to-face contact for students with additional needs.	spk_128
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	Regarding specific provision for children who are in danger of disadvantage, there is a programme in place and all the guidelines and provisions have been worked out with the partners in education. For example, schools have identified individuals who make direct contact with students. There is the Check and Connect programme and a variety of other programmes. The home school community liaison officers are working in these areas. The school meals programme continues for children. For children who might not have the technology, schools have purchased the technology to make it available to students.	spk_134
Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	I agree with the Deputy that the provision of special education remains an absolute priority to ensure that children with additional needs are catered for in the midst of a lockdown and otherwise. It was for all of those reasons the Government and I made the decision that in the midst of the current lockdown children with additional needs would be catered for, but this proved difficult for the partners in education. We are in a better position now and I am happy with the announcement that has been made today. In terms of operating in complete partnership with the parents, students and teachers, that has always been the hallmark of everything that we have done in education. The Deputy specifically raised the leaving certificate. The advisory committee is constituted to include parents, teachers, students, managerial bodies, principals, deputy principals and all of those engaged in the sector. The Deputy should be under no illusions about that. The advisory committee continues to meet. Accommodations that were necessary for the leaving certificate were put in place last year. The advisory committee will continue to look at all contingencies and measures as regards leaving certificate 2021.	spk_137

Norma Foley	49	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2021-01-14	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education): Statements	dbsect_6	I thank the Deputy. I can give my view and everybody else has a view. The Deputy spoke about certainty. When it was proposed to hold the leaving certificate exams last November in the middle of a period of level 5 restrictions, some doubt was cast as to whether we could deliver that. Yet again, taking on board the public health advice made available, a full leaving certificate written exam was very successfully offered and achieved in November. The advisory group is taking cognisance of that and of all we learned in the running of the exams in November. It is listening to all the other voices that are part of the stakeholder engagement as we move forward. Those deliberations will continue, always underpinned by public health advice. I absolutely and categorically agree with the Deputy that students do better in school. That has always been my view. Throughout level 5 and difficult circumstances from September to December, when many businesses and other places were closing, we managed very successfully to keep schools open for that reason. The schools have closed due to significant mobility in the education sector and it has been necessary to stand down more than 900,000 people in the education sector to benefit wider society.	spk_150

They deserve that priority. I thought that then and I think it now. I thank Deputy Harkin for her comments. It is very positive that we are working towards the resumption of education for children with additional needs on 21 January.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	Practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices were provided to the school system in August, in the context of reopening for September 2020. Contrary to what the Deputy said, this guidance has recently been reviewed and was circulated to the education partners. The updated guidance has now been published. As regards good ventilation practices in schools, it is important, particularly as we get further into winter, that we achieve an appropriate balance between good ventilation and comfort. The overall approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use, for example, during break times, lunchtime and at the end of each school day, and partially open when classrooms are in use to achieve appropriate airflow. It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy or colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms, including those in prefabricated accommodation, during periods of colder weather. As part of managing comfort levels in classrooms, schools should check that their heating systems are set at the recommended manufacturer's guidance levels to maximise the heat available to the school. In addition, heating should operate for extended periods during colder weather to counteract, as best as possible, the impact of windows being open in order to maintain an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort levels.  My Department has reviewed the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, guidance recommending that consideration be given to installing indoor air quality monitors in classrooms. The purpose of a monitor in this context is to assist in determining when windows should be opened. It should be noted that an air monitor would not increase the air temperature in a classroom. As reflected in the updated guidance, my Department has concluded that it will likely be necessary for windows to be open at the frequency I outlined earlier to ensure appropriate levels of ventilation in classrooms, irrespective of whether the opening of windows is prompted by an indoor air quality monitor, which is a reactive approach, or through the proactive approach outlined in the guidance. While this matter, as well as supporting data, will be kept under review, the Department does not consider it necessary for schools to install such monitors in classrooms where the practical steps outlined in the updated guidance are applied. However, it is a matter for individual schools to consider whether they wish to put in place mechanisms of this nature.	spk_180
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	I appreciate the Deputy's point. In the interest of balance and proper context, no building has been built for a Covid-19 environment. This issue is not unique to what is happening in the school environment. It is happening in every building of which we are aware. I again emphasise that air monitors do not increase the air temperature in a room. They merely monitor when one should open or close a window. Significant practical guidance has been given to schools around measures of that nature, such as opening windows before classes commence, during break times, lunchtimes, in the evenings, and so on. I appreciate that such measures are reliant on an abundance of practical common sense and practicality but, in my experience, there is an abundance of that in schools as is. Schools have the freedom to use the minor works grant to address this issue but as I have said to the Deputy, I will keep everything under review. I will do that constantly for anything as regards education.	spk_182

I reiterate that this issue is being dealt with by many bodies and many buildings have to cope with similar situations at present. As the Deputy will be aware, the capitation grant increased by 2.5% in the budget for 2020-21, which is on top of a 5% increase in the previous year. I intend, if at all possible, to continue the trajectory of that increase going forward. That is important. Equally, substantial funding has gone into schools to address measures of a Covid-19 nature. That has helped schools considerably to do what needs to be done. 	spk_184
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	I acknowledge the huge contribution made by all school leaders, particularly during this academic year as they continue to work to ensure schools can operate safely. The Roadmap for the Full Return to School provides for comprehensive supports across a range of areas to allow for the safe and sustainable operation of schools. This package of supports totals some €557 million for the 2020-2021 school year and includes funding for additional staffing, management supports, enhanced cleaning, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment costs and increased capital works funding for schools under the Covid-19 response plans. As part of this additional funding, specific funding was provided, as the Deputy pointed out, to support principals and deputy principals who undertake teaching duties in primary schools.This funding provides each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week and release days for deputy principals in those schools that have an existing administrative principal for this school year. More than 1,700 primary schools with teaching principals have benefitted from the increase in release days. These supports will remain in place for the remainder of this school year and the continuation of these supports will be considered as part of the ongoing measures required to support schools to operate in a Covid-19 context and to implement the control measure required to limit the spread of Covid-19 in our schools in line with public health advice and the annual estimates process for the next academic year.	spk_186
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	I appreciate the huge workload placed on the shoulders of school leaders and school communities. I recognise the importance of these additional days and how beneficial they have been. Now they have been given, we can see the excellent use to which they were put and how necessary a provision they were. The Department showed considerable foresight in putting them in place. I in no way underestimate their benefit or value. We will review the Covid-19 measures required for next year in the context of the budget but I am very conscious of the benefit of that measure. There are various supports for principals and deputy principals, recognising the leadership roles that they play in schools. I do not underestimate their value or importance in schools.	spk_188
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	I appreciate the Deputy's points. In the context of Covid-19, a series of webinars was put on on the specific demands placed on principals and school leaders.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	From Monday, 9 November, Ireland has implemented the EU co-ordinated traffic lights approach for those travelling into Ireland. In general this requires those returning to or entering Ireland from orange or red list countries to restrict their movements for 14 days. This includes school staff, parents and students, including students coming from abroad to attend school in Ireland. Restricting movements means staying indoors in one location and avoiding contact with other people and social situations as much as possible. Schools have a duty of care to all their students and staff members. If a school has reasonable grounds for believing that its duty of care toward its staff and students is being undermined, it can refuse access to the student or staff member concerned during this period. The whole school community is working together to create a positive and safe environment for teaching and learning in the particular and often challenging context of Covid-19. Ensuring that all students and their parents are made aware of the public health requirements as they relate to schools is very important. My Department, working with the education partners, has developed a range of information and resources for parents and students to reinforce the importance of the safety control measures in place in schools to minimise the risk of spread of infection. These measures are observed by all students. Contacting An Garda Síochána to establish the travel arrangements of students and staff is not considered appropriate.	spk_198
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	I cannot speak to the specific case the Deputy has raised because I am not familiar with it. In general, schools have a duty of care to their students and staff, as I have outlined. If there is a view that this duty of care is being impeded by the return of a student who has travelled abroad and is not observing whatever restrictions have been deemed necessary at that time, the school can act. Schools have every right to refuse access to anyone who has not fulfilled his or her obligation to restrict his or her movements. That has operated well throughout the school system. There are 4,000 schools with 100,000 staff and 1 million students. This issue has not been raised with the Department on an ongoing basis. As in all contexts, schools have sufficient practicality, wisdom and know-how to deal with these incidents. Parents have also exercised very good judgment. They have been highly responsible in how they have operated within the Covid-19 guidelines pertaining to travel and to any other areas.	spk_200
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	I thank the Deputy. I appreciate the sincerity with which he makes this point.

I have every confidence that those measures will be implemented appropriately by schools.	spk_202
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	I thank the Deputy. As he is aware, the management of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in schools is led by the HSE's departments of public health. The Department of Education and Skills does not provide guidance of a clinical or medical nature. The contact tracing teams are led by public health professionals. The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has published a definition of a close contact in an educational setting, which was communicated to all schools and their partners in education. I will outline that definition. In accordance with current Health Protection Surveillance Centre guidelines, a clinical public health risk assessment will be undertaken for all educational settings where a confirmed case has attended whilst infectious. A public health risk assessment defines a close contact as any person who has had face-to-face contact within less than 1 m of a confirmed case of Covid-19 for more than 15 minutes in a school day, or any person who has been in contact between 1 m and 2 m of a confirmed case of Covid-19 for more than 15 minutes in a school day. Other mitigating measures including face coverings, pods, ventilation, infection prevention and control measures or uncertain compliance with other mitigating measures are also considered. Contacts are assessed from contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19 during the infectious period, 48 hours before the onset of symptoms if symptomatic or 24 hours before the test for Covid-19 was taken for those who are asymptomatic. This definition is based on international public health guidance. It is the view of the HSE's departments of public health that the evidence available to date shows that schools are proving to be safe spaces for children and their staff. The department of public health has also facilitated webinars for school leaders on this and other public health messages. Furthermore, dedicated school teams have been enhanced to provide specific and dedicated supports to schools where there is a confirmed case of Covid-19. The Department will continue to work closely with all the education partners and the public health system in order that schools can continue to be supported during this very challenging time.	spk_204
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	I should point out that I appreciate and understand absolutely why this is an area of huge concern. It is an area of huge concern not only within education facilities but in wider society as well. I acknowledge the very close working relationship and the excellent work undertaken by public health on care of our schools and incidents in our schools. We have enhanced the school teams. Obviously, they are still led by public health because it is public health's determination that qualifies everything within the school, but we have added to the supports of the public health teams for the benefit of schools. There are phone lines in place operating on a seven-day basis. As for the issues the Deputy raised that the partners in education might have, again, there are weekly meetings with the partners in education and public health. That is a very positive move and, I think, one that has been very positively embraced by the partners in education also. As for the updating or changing of guidelines, public health has the freedom to constantly review and update guidelines as needs be. When they do that, we act accordingly.	spk_206
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_19	As I said, and I will reiterate it, there has been huge engagement between public health and schools. The school teams process is working particularly well and to general acceptance all round, including partners in education and schools on the ground. The school teams are doing a very good job, and that has improved and added to communication levels between schools and public health. Equally, the provision of webinars for school leaders and information being made available have also been very positively embraced. Officials from my Department meet with the partners in education and public health on an ongoing basis to address any individual and general queries they might have.	spk_208
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	School Equipment	dbsect_20	Practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices were provided to the school system in August, in the context of reopening for September 2020. Contrary to what the Deputy said, this guidance has recently been reviewed and was circulated to the education partners. The updated guidance has now been published. As regards good ventilation practices in schools, it is important, particularly as we get further into winter, that we achieve an appropriate balance between good ventilation and comfort. The overall approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use, for example, during break times, lunchtime and at the end of each school day, and partially open when classrooms are in use to achieve appropriate airflow. It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy or colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms, including those in prefabricated accommodation, during periods of colder weather. As part of managing comfort levels in classrooms, schools should check that their heating systems are set at the recommended manufacturer's guidance levels to maximise the heat available to the school. In addition, heating should operate for extended periods during colder weather to counteract, as best as possible, the impact of windows being open in order to maintain an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort levels.  My Department has reviewed the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, guidance recommending that consideration be given to installing indoor air quality monitors in classrooms. The purpose of a monitor in this context is to assist in determining when windows should be opened. It should be noted that an air monitor would not increase the air temperature in a classroom. As reflected in the updated guidance, my Department has concluded that it will likely be necessary for windows to be open at the frequency I outlined earlier to ensure appropriate levels of ventilation in classrooms, irrespective of whether the opening of windows is prompted by an indoor air quality monitor, which is a reactive approach, or through the proactive approach outlined in the guidance. While this matter, as well as supporting data, will be kept under review, the Department does not consider it necessary for schools to install such monitors in classrooms where the practical steps outlined in the updated guidance are applied. However, it is a matter for individual schools to consider whether they wish to put in place mechanisms of this nature.	spk_180
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	School Equipment	dbsect_20	I appreciate the Deputy's point. In the interest of balance and proper context, no building has been built for a Covid-19 environment. This issue is not unique to what is happening in the school environment. It is happening in every building of which we are aware. I again emphasise that air monitors do not increase the air temperature in a room. They merely monitor when one should open or close a window. Significant practical guidance has been given to schools around measures of that nature, such as opening windows before classes commence, during break times, lunchtimes, in the evenings, and so on. I appreciate that such measures are reliant on an abundance of practical common sense and practicality but, in my experience, there is an abundance of that in schools as is. Schools have the freedom to use the minor works grant to address this issue but as I have said to the Deputy, I will keep everything under review. I will do that constantly for anything as regards education.	spk_182

It was paid in August and will be paid again in December. It gives schools the autonomy to do what needs to be done or whatever they might specifically identify within the school that requires work. This can be a very wide capacity of work. It can be limited to one area or can be finance that is disbursed into a variety of projects within the school. That is a very positive movement for schools, and the uptake of it has been exceptional and has been greeted very positively by schools. Of course, if there are other works to be done, there is also the emergency works scheme and the summer works scheme, but to date there has been no question of funding not being made available to schools for work that needs to be done.	spk_212
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_25	Regarding the minor works grants, we are talking about an allocation of €75 million in August and €15 million now in December. A school with 1,000 pupils, for example, would have received €110,000 in the first tranche last August.There is substantial funding going into schools. As I stated, more funding is to come in December. However, I will take the details of the specific case raised by the Deputy. Obviously, where there are other extraordinary measures we ask schools to revert to the Department in order that we can consider individual cases. I wish to be clear that there has been a general acceptance without contradiction that the amount of money - now in excess of €500 million - that has been provided to schools for a variety of works, such as minor works, provision of payment for PPE or whatever else is required in the schools, has been quite remarkable.	spk_214
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_25	I wish to acknowledge the Deputy's personal interest in moving this issue forward and his engagement with me on the matter on several occasions. I can confirm that the Department is in receipt of an application for additional school accommodation from the school authority referred to by the Deputy. The application is currently being assessed and, once it is completed, the school authority will be informed of the outcome. When capacity issues arise, they may not be as a result of a lack of accommodation. They may be driven by certain other factors, such as a duplication of applications if pupils have applied for a place in several schools in the area. Another factor may be that pupils are unable to get a place in their preferred school but there are places in other schools in the town or area. Some towns or areas have single-sex schools and although places may be available in such schools, they may not be available to all pupils. There is also the issue of external draw, that is, pupils coming from outside the local area. The true extent of any capacity issue will only become known once these issues are discussed with the relevant school authorities. Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including the patron in question, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year which may necessitate action.	spk_216

I am aware that the application the school has made is for 11 general classrooms and eight additional specialist rooms.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_25	School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of my Department. In the 2019-20 school year, more than 120,000 children were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering more than 100 million km at a cost in excess of €219 million in 2019. The Department is very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for children with special educational needs and this is reflected in the approach that is taken. In the current school year, there are more than 14,500 children availing of special needs school transport, which is an increase of 5,300 children since 2013. The Department funded the school transport scheme in 2019 in the amount of just over €219 million, with 53% of that allocated to the transport scheme for children with special needs. The purpose of the special needs transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the scheme, children are eligible for transport where they have special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability and are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class, special school or unit that is, or can be, resourced to meet their needs. Where practicable, my Department will consider the provision of specific or individual transport arrangements in circumstances where travel in the company of other children is not deemed feasible. In addition, there is a facility within the special needs transport scheme for the appointment of a school bus escort where a child's care and safety needs while on school transport are such as to require that support. All eligible children are exempt from school transport charges. A special transport grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements may be provided at the discretion of the Department in certain situations where, for example, the child's care or medical needs are such as to make the provision of a transport service impracticable. While the closing date for receipt of applications for school transport in general is the last Friday in April of any given year for the following school year, my Department accepts applications all year round for the special needs transport scheme. As the Deputy may be aware, public health advice issued to my Department in late August recommended that all post-primary transport services operate at 50% capacity. That recommendation is being implemented across all special education services on which post-primary children travel.

The special transport grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements may be provided at the discretion of the Department in situations where: Bus Éireann is not in a position to provide a transport service; where a child's age, behavioural difficulties or medical needs are such as to make the provision of a transport service impractical; an escort is considered necessary and the provision of such support is not feasible; or the cost of establishing or maintaining a service is considered prohibitive.

For that reason, as I pointed out with regard to the special transport grant and the various criteria, the criteria are quite wide in terms of eligibility and making provision for personally providing transport for children based on their specific needs or Bus Éireann's capacity. With regard to the nearest school and issues that might arise there, a review of the entire transport scheme is pending. On the case referred to by the Deputy, I would be pleased if he would give me specific details about the individual concerned and the needs required. I will give a commitment that we will examine the individual case.	spk_235

It is important to note that decisions on school uniform policies are a matter for the school's board of management at local level. Schools are advised to consult with parents and students when drafting a policy on uniforms. My Department provides funding and policy direction for schools. It has legal powers to investigate individual complaints where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with section 29 of the Education Act 1998. The Department's role is also to clarify for parents and students how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. With regard to the broader question posed by the Deputy, I agree that there is no place for sexist attitudes in Irish society, including in our schools. The Department has been working along with other Departments and agencies to support the full implementation of the National Women and Girls Strategy 2017-2020. The vision of the strategy is ""an Ireland where all women enjoy equality with men and can achieve their full potential, while enjoying a safe and fulfilling life"". The overall goal of the strategy is ""to change attitudes and practices preventing women's and girls' full participation in education, employment and public life at all levels, and to improve services for women and girls, with priority given to the needs of those experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, the poorest outcomes."" It is the aim of the Department that every child has access to equitable education and that each learner feels safe and happy in the school environment, at every stage. The curriculum at both primary and post-primary levels aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted. Attitudes towards gender are primarily explored in the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum. This is addressed in an age-appropriate manner from primary level through to senior cycle. At each level, multiple strands of the SPHE curriculum examines gender roles and stereotyping and their adverse effect, in particular regarding gender effects. As a part of the curriculum, students explore and deepen their awareness of stereotyping and its influence on attitudes and behaviour."	spk_245

My Department has already engaged with the school and it will continue to engage with it. A report will be furnished to me once that engagement is concluded. The engagement is in the first instance with the board of management, which has responsibility for the day-to-day running of the school. Deputy Barry will be aware that the board has autonomy in the running of the school. As I outlined to the Deputy, the Department primarily has control over the policy and funding of a school, and in particular instances where an individual complaint involves refused enrolment and expulsion or suspension. In terms of the current report, the initial engagement with the school involves a determination of what occurred, how it occurred, who was involved and who was impacted.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_25	I concur with Deputy Barry on the importance of the student voice, which is immeasurable in the school community. Testament to that is the manner in which the student voice is very much integrated into all actions within the Department in terms of consultation with the education partners. Deputy Barry will be aware that the student voice was a critical one in the calculated grades process. The student voice was represented at every step of the way. In the first instance, the proposal on calculated grades came from students themselves. That is equally the case in curriculum reform. The student voice is embedded in the consultation process that is undertaken by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and in other initiatives of that nature. The entire curriculum that is provided in schools is considered to be for all learners, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, gender or orientation. It is the aim of the Department that every child has access to equitable education and that every learner feels safe and happy in the school environment at every stage of their experience of the school environment. The curriculum at both primary and post-primary levels aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.	spk_249
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_25	I recognise the important role cleaners play in the successful operation of schools in every year, but particularly so in the Covid-19 context.I am very conscious of the superb work done on an ongoing basis by the cleaners in our schools. Currently each school is required to have a Covid-19 response plan for safe operation through prevention, early detection and control of Covid-19 in line with public health advice. Cleaning is an important aspect of infection prevention and control measures in schools to minimise the risk of transmission of infection. Significant additional funding has been provided to all schools for putting in place additional cleaning, and funding is provided on a  As the Deputy may be aware, cleaners are employed directly by schools using the ancillary grant mechanism to schools. In education and training board, ETB, schools, cleaners are employed directly by that board. The provision of a pension is therefore a matter for the respective individual school or education and training board. Schools and ETBs, as employers, are obliged to provide access to a personal retirement savings account. In line with the Government Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023, the Government has committed to developing and implementing a State-sponsored, automatic enrolment, supplementary retirement savings system by 2022. Under automatic enrolment, employees without personal retirement savings who meet certain age and earnings criteria will be automatically enrolled into a State-sponsored, quality-assured, supplementary retirement savings system, with freedom of choice, as always, to opt out.	spk_252
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_25	I reiterate that I do not for one minute underestimate the value and importance of the work of support staff, and particularly the cleaners that the Deputy mentions. Cleaners are nonetheless employed directly by schools using the ancillary grant. It is the current operation. In ETB schools the cleaners are employed directly by the board. The provision of a pension is therefore a matter for the individual school, if these people are employed through the school and a capitation grant, or the individual ETB if the people are employees of the ETB. I also reiterate that schools and ETBs, as employers, are obliged to provide access to the personal retirement savings account. Equally, as I have outlined, there is the roadmap for pensions reform, with a mechanism anticipated to be in place for 2022 for the automatic enrolment of people into a scheme.

I know from personal experience that these people work on a very generous basis in a willing and positive way. They often go above and beyond the call of duty. I recognise this work, which I have seen for many years. As it stands, cleaners are employed by schools through a grant mechanism or directly by an ETB.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_26	Practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices were provided to schools in August in the context of reopening for September 2020. This guidance has recently been reviewed and was circulated to the education partners for their feedback. The updated guidance has now been published. As for good ventilation practices in schools, it is important, particularly as we get further into winter, that we achieve an appropriate balance between good ventilation and comfort in schools. The overall approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use - for example, during break times, lunchtimes and at the end of each school day - and partially open when classrooms are in use to achieve appropriate airflow. It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy or cold weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms, including in prefabricated accommodation, during periods of colder weather. As part of managing comfort levels in classrooms, schools should check that their heating systems are set according to the recommended manufacturer's guidance levels to maximise the available heat to the school. In addition, heating should operate for extended periods during colder weather to counteract as best as possible the impact of windows being open - partially when classrooms are in use and fully when not in use - in order to maintain an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort levels.	spk_210

It was paid in August and will be paid again in December. It gives schools the autonomy to do what needs to be done or whatever they might specifically identify within the school that requires work. This can be a very wide capacity of work. It can be limited to one area or can be finance that is disbursed into a variety of projects within the school. That is a very positive movement for schools, and the uptake of it has been exceptional and has been greeted very positively by schools. Of course, if there are other works to be done, there is also the emergency works scheme and the summer works scheme, but to date there has been no question of funding not being made available to schools for work that needs to be done.	spk_212
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_26	Regarding the minor works grants, we are talking about an allocation of €75 million in August and €15 million now in December. A school with 1,000 pupils, for example, would have received €110,000 in the first tranche last August.There is substantial funding going into schools. As I stated, more funding is to come in December. However, I will take the details of the specific case raised by the Deputy. Obviously, where there are other extraordinary measures we ask schools to revert to the Department in order that we can consider individual cases. I wish to be clear that there has been a general acceptance without contradiction that the amount of money - now in excess of €500 million - that has been provided to schools for a variety of works, such as minor works, provision of payment for PPE or whatever else is required in the schools, has been quite remarkable.	spk_214

I can confirm that the Department is in receipt of an application for additional school accommodation from the school authority referred to by the Deputy. The application is currently being assessed and, once it is completed, the school authority will be informed of the outcome. When capacity issues arise, they may not be as a result of a lack of accommodation. They may be driven by certain other factors, such as a duplication of applications if pupils have applied for a place in several schools in the area. Another factor may be that pupils are unable to get a place in their preferred school but there are places in other schools in the town or area. Some towns or areas have single-sex schools and although places may be available in such schools, they may not be available to all pupils. There is also the issue of external draw, that is, pupils coming from outside the local area. The true extent of any capacity issue will only become known once these issues are discussed with the relevant school authorities. Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including the patron in question, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year which may necessitate action.	spk_216

There has been significant growth there. I know the application has been with the Department since April 2019. For the information of the Deputy, discussions are ongoing with the ETB to agree the long-term projected enrolment for the school. I am informed that this process is very close to completion. I am aware that the application the school has made is for 11 general classrooms and eight additional specialist rooms. On the positive side, the discussions with the ETB to finalise the projected enrolment so that we do not find ourselves in a similar position further down the line in terms of capacity and enrolment are nearing completion.	spk_218

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-12-01	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_29	School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of my Department. In the 2019-20 school year, more than 120,000 children were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering more than 100 million km at a cost in excess of €219 million in 2019. The Department is very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for children with special educational needs and this is reflected in the approach that is taken. In the current school year, there are more than 14,500 children availing of special needs school transport, which is an increase of 5,300 children since 2013. The Department funded the school transport scheme in 2019 in the amount of just over €219 million, with 53% of that allocated to the transport scheme for children with special needs. The purpose of the special needs transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the scheme, children are eligible for transport where they have special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability and are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class, special school or unit that is, or can be, resourced to meet their needs. Where practicable, my Department will consider the provision of specific or individual transport arrangements in circumstances where travel in the company of other children is not deemed feasible. In addition, there is a facility within the special needs transport scheme for the appointment of a school bus escort where a child's care and safety needs while on school transport are such as to require that support. All eligible children are exempt from school transport charges. A special transport grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements may be provided at the discretion of the Department in certain situations where, for example, the child's care or medical needs are such as to make the provision of a transport service impracticable. While the closing date for receipt of applications for school transport in general is the last Friday in April of any given year for the following school year, my Department accepts applications all year round for the special needs transport scheme. As the Deputy may be aware, public health advice issued to my Department in late August recommended that all post-primary transport services operate at 50% capacity. That recommendation is being implemented across all special education services on which post-primary children travel. The special education transport scheme is providing for the transportation needs of pupils with disabilities.	spk_229

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-11-24	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_43	I thank both Deputies for raising these issues as it gives me an opportunity to outline the current position regarding provision for children with special educational needs and the supports in place for schools with special classes. Enabling children with special educational needs, including autism, to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for Government. Next year, more than 20% of the total educational budget, or €2 billion, will be invested in supporting children with special needs. As a result of the numbers of special education teachers, SNAs and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. Special class provision in mainstream primary and post-primary schools is a central element of the continuum of education provision in place to support children with special educational needs. This continuum extends from full-time placement in mainstream classes and special classes through to full-time enrolment in special schools with a number of options in between. The Department supports this continuum through a range of dedicated supports in line with the needs of the child. These supports include the provision of teachers, SNAs and psychological support from the National Educational Psychological Service. In addition, there are specialist supports provided by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, including extensive professional development programmes for principals and teachers and advice for schools, parents and families. The overall aim of the continuum is to ensure that every child is supported in the journey of realising his or her potential through education in an inclusive and caring school environment.  I am keenly aware of the huge contribution made by all principals, including teaching principals, in supporting this continuum. I acknowledge the work of school leaders who opened special classes in response to the needs of their community. I am aware too that Covid-19, as Deputy Ó Laoghaire outlined, has placed an additional strain on principals and our schools. Apart from the supports I outlined earlier, there are a number of other supports provided by the Department. As part of the additional funding to schools, €10.2 million has been allocated specifically to support principals and deputy principals who undertake teaching duties in primary schools. This funding will provide each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week, and release days for deputy principals in those schools that have an existing administrative principal for this school year. More than 1,700 primary schools with teaching principals have benefitted from the increase in release days. Teaching principals in schools with special classes are allocated a further four release days, in addition to the 37 allocated to each school with a teaching principal. There are also arrangements in place for schools to cluster their principal release days into a full-time post which will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school. Notwithstanding the extent of this investment and the supports which have been put in place, I am also conscious that there are some parts of the country, including Dublin 12, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified needs. The process is ongoing. It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and, where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. As Minister, I have powers under section 37A of the Education Act to direct a school to provide additional places but this power is only used as a last resort where all reasonable efforts have failed. Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under section 37. The legislative process is again under way this year in respect of south Dublin. While progress is being made, the NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream.  In terms of the provision of additional special school places in the area, I can confirm that sites such as Scoil Colm are currently being examined. The work will continue until every child has access to a suitable education. In the meantime, special educational needs organisers, SENOs, are available to support both families and schools who need help or advice.	spk_518

The Department will continue to support principals in schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.Some €2 billion, or 20%, of next year's total education budget, will be spent on making additional provision for children with special educational needs. This is to be welcomed and is richly deserved. It means that the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants, special classes and special school places has increased significantly. This will enable children with special educational needs to continue being a priority for the Government. The Deputy will be aware that I am familiar with the Scoil Colm case. I have engaged with representatives on it and will expedite it as quickly as I can.	spk_521
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-11-24	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_43	"I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding school developments in east Cork. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, GIS. The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including child benefit data from the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own school enrolment databases, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. The process has been strengthened this year through three specific initiatives, the first of which is enhanced engagement with local authorities in respect of the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process. The second initiative entails additional engagement on school place requirements with patron bodies regarding their local knowledge. Education and training boards, ETBs, diocesan offices and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, An Foras Pátrúnachta and so on can also be important sources of local knowledge. This will add to information provided to the Department by local authorities or individual schools. The third initiative involves utilising the information gleaned from schools under the national inventory of school capacity completed by individual schools last year as part of the October returns process. Where data indicate that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, its delivery is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; or the provision of a new school or schools. Similar to the process adopted for September 2020 readiness, the Department will engage further with patron bodies in the coming weeks in advance of identifying specific September 2021 capacity pressure point priorities that will necessitate specific action. In a ""normal"" year, addressing the increased demands for school places, while challenging, is manageable, generally through utilisation of existing spare capacity within schools, rental, temporary accommodation or other short-term measures pending the delivery of permanent accommodation. Building projects are in train or proposed for a number of post-primary schools in Cork East, which is the area of specific interest to the Deputy. Carrigtwohill Community College is a co-educational post-primary school established in 2016. It is currently located in temporary accommodation pending the construction of a permanent school building. The new school building will have capacity for 1,000 pupils. It is at stage 2b of the architectural planning process and planning permission has been granted. Pending the construction of the permanent building, the Department has approved additional temporary accommodation to cater for the school's immediate needs. This project is part of a new three-school campus development in Carrigtwohill. The other two schools to be located on the campus are Scoil Chlíodhna and Scoil Mhuire Naofa. St. Aloysius' College, Carrigtwohill, is an all-girls post-primary school with an enrolment of 776 for the 2019-20 school year. The Department has approved a grant to the school to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils. The project has been devolved to the school authority for delivery. St. Colman's Community College, Midleton, is a co-educational post-primary school with an enrolment of 775 pupils for the 2019-20 school year. A building project for the school that will provide capacity for 1,000 pupils is currently on site and is due to be completed in the coming weeks. Pobalscoil na Tríonóide, Youghal, is a co-educational post-primary school with an enrolment of 977 pupils for the 2019-20 school year. The Department has approved a grant to the school to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,200 pupils. The project has been devolved to the school authority for delivery. Carrignafoy Community College, Cobh, is a co-educational post-primary school with an enrolment of 321 pupils for the 2019-20 school year. A building project to expand the school's capacity to cater for 600 pupils is at the early stage of the architectural planning process. The project is being delivered by the patron, Cork ETB. Coláiste Muire, Cobh, is a co-educational school with an enrolment of 666 pupils for the 2019-20 school year. An application for additional accommodation has been received from the school and is under assessment in the Department. A decision on the application will be conveyed to the school authority when the assessment process has been completed. St. Mary's High School, Midleton, is an all-girls post-primary school with an enrolment of 718 pupils for the 2019-20 school year. An application for additional accommodation has been received by the Department and is under assessment. A decision on the application will be conveyed to the school authority when the assessment process has been completed."	spk_523

It is also, of course, open to the patrons of schools to submit an application for additional interim accommodation to the Department for consideration. should it be required. I want to thank the Deputy for raising the issue of accommodation in east Cork. The Department is concerned to ensure that sufficient capacity is in place to meet the needs of schools throughout this area, through the delivery of the building projects that are planned or those that are in train, as well as through the Department's engagement with patron bodies in identifying specific capacity pressure priorities for September 2021, which will necessitate specific action. In regard to the Carrigtwohill issue raised by the Deputy, he is aware that it is part of the bundle for the first quarter of 2021 and will be expedited as quickly as possible. I will of course continue to work with the Deputy on an ongoing basis. I know all of these projects are of particular interest to him and I commend him on his diligence and ongoing interest in delivering these projects for the east Cork area.	spk_526
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-11-24	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_46	I thank both Deputies for raising these issues as it gives me an opportunity to outline the current position regarding provision for children with special educational needs and the supports in place for schools with special classes. Enabling children with special educational needs, including autism, to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for Government. Next year, more than 20% of the total educational budget, or €2 billion, will be invested in supporting children with special needs. As a result of the numbers of special education teachers, SNAs and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. Special class provision in mainstream primary and post-primary schools is a central element of the continuum of education provision in place to support children with special educational needs. This continuum extends from full-time placement in mainstream classes and special classes through to full-time enrolment in special schools with a number of options in between. The Department supports this continuum through a range of dedicated supports in line with the needs of the child. These supports include the provision of teachers, SNAs and psychological support from the National Educational Psychological Service. In addition, there are specialist supports provided by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, including extensive professional development programmes for principals and teachers and advice for schools, parents and families. The overall aim of the continuum is to ensure that every child is supported in the journey of realising his or her potential through education in an inclusive and caring school environment.  I am keenly aware of the huge contribution made by all principals, including teaching principals, in supporting this continuum. I acknowledge the work of school leaders who opened special classes in response to the needs of their community. I am aware too that Covid-19, as Deputy Ó Laoghaire outlined, has placed an additional strain on principals and our schools. Apart from the supports I outlined earlier, there are a number of other supports provided by the Department. As part of the additional funding to schools, €10.2 million has been allocated specifically to support principals and deputy principals who undertake teaching duties in primary schools. This funding will provide each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week, and release days for deputy principals in those schools that have an existing administrative principal for this school year. More than 1,700 primary schools with teaching principals have benefitted from the increase in release days. Teaching principals in schools with special classes are allocated a further four release days, in addition to the 37 allocated to each school with a teaching principal. There are also arrangements in place for schools to cluster their principal release days into a full-time post which will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school. Notwithstanding the extent of this investment and the supports which have been put in place, I am also conscious that there are some parts of the country, including Dublin 12, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified needs. The process is ongoing. It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and, where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. As Minister, I have powers under section 37A of the Education Act to direct a school to provide additional places but this power is only used as a last resort where all reasonable efforts have failed. Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under section 37. The legislative process is again under way this year in respect of south Dublin. While progress is being made, the NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream.  In terms of the provision of additional special school places in the area, I can confirm that sites such as Scoil Colm are currently being examined. The work will continue until every child has access to a suitable education. In the meantime, special educational needs organisers, SENOs, are available to support both families and schools who need help or advice.	spk_518

They are an invaluable resource within our schools. In reference to the points made by the Deputies, I acknowledge that a letter issued from my Department. It was sent out in response to the confusion that had arisen as a result of a communication issued by Fórsa to schools stating that there was no liability for SNAs to complete the 72 hours of non-contact hours to which the Deputies referred. It was important that my Department issued a clarification because that was what was being requested on foot of the previous correspondence. The letter reminded schools of the provisions relating to the 72 hours requirement for SNAs. That requirement has been in place since 2005 and forms part of an SNA's contract of employment, which was agreed with unions. The letter did not, in any shape or form, change the terms and conditions of SNAs or amend previous agreements. Under the terms of the standard employment contract agreed in 2005, SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term, not exceeding 12 days in total. Under the Croke Park agreement, it was agreed to convert the previous requirement of SNAs to be available for 12 days outside of the school year to a requirement of 72 hours, applying  Some recent commentary has referred to the 72 hours as being ""unpaid"". In fact, remuneration for the 12 days or 72 hours is included as part of the normal salary paid to an SNA under the terms of the 2005 agreed contract. As part of the 2011 agreement on reconfiguration, it was agreed that the scheduling of the hours is at the discretion of school management. Schools were informed that they should ensure that accurate records in this regard are kept. Fórsa, the trade union which represents SNAs, has formally sought abolition of the contractual requirement for the 72 hours through industrial relations channels. In addition, the union has formally sought that the 72 hours be frozen and that employers do not request their completion for the duration of the Covid pandemic. As I indicated, some confusion arose as a consequence of the communications issued by Fórsa to schools. This led schools and management bodies to ask the Department to clarify the position, which it did. During the course of discussions on the former claim, all parties were notified that the Department intended to issue a letter to school management bodies to remind schools of the provisions relating to the 72 hours. The agreed uses of the 72 hours include for special educational needs pupil-centred activity such as assistance with care planning, learning resource administration such as preparing class rooms and materials, class and school planning and development, assistance with special examination centres for the State examinations, and training. The duties listed in Circular 0071/2011 form part of the normal range of SNA duties and are, therefore, liable to be performed at any time during normal working hours, including during the 72 hours. The 72 hours allow for very important support work, such as assistance with care planning, learning resource administration and training, to be carried out without reducing SNAs' time with the pupils in their care. Accordingly, the suspension of the requirement to complete the 72 hours would have a direct negative impact on pupils with special educational needs as it would impede on normal class time. Fórsa has claimed that SNAs are being asked to carry out duties inappropriate to the grade as part of the 72 hours, as referred to by the Deputies. The Department's recent letter reminded schools of the agreed list of uses for the 72 hours under Circular 0071/2011 and stated that the grievance procedures should be used where allegations of inappropriate use arise.

I do not dispute that they mean well. However, the timing of this Bill would have serious unintended consequences for schools that are currently undertaking their admission processes for the 2021-22 school year under the existing legislation.  As the House is aware, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 was signed into law on 18 July 2018. The overall objective of the Act is to provide a new framework for school enrolment that is designed to ensure that every child is catered for and that the way in which schools decide on applications for admission is transparent. The measures provided for in the Act make the admissions process transparent and consistent for all. The Act creates confidence for parents that the admission criteria laid down by schools and the procedures used by them are visible and legitimate. The 2018 Act is part of a suite of measures that seek to take greater account of the needs of parents and students in the school system. It provides for schools to state explicitly in their admission policies that they will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the Traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion, while including provision for single-sex schools and denominational schools to reflect in their admission policies the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation. The 2018 Act also sets out certain criteria that schools cannot take into account when deciding on an application for admission or considering an offer of a place, such as consideration of a student's academic ability, skills or aptitude, or consideration of a parent's occupation, financial status, academic ability, skills or aptitude, apart from exceptions provided by the Act. On 14 January 2020, certain sections of the Act were commenced in order to be operational in time for the admission processes for the 2021-22 school year. From February 2020, all recognised schools in Ireland were required to draft a new school admission policy in accordance with the Act's requirements. The Act was commenced earlier this year to allow sufficient time for consultation with the patron, the staff of the school and the parents of the children attending the school, as required by the Act. The new admission policies which have been approved by patrons are now published on individual school websites. These policies will apply for admission to school for September 2021 and onwards. Schools have worked extremely hard to develop, consult on and draft these new policies. The Act requires that any subsequent changes to a school's admission policy requires the consultation and patron approval process to be undertaken once again before the policy can be published by the school. Given that schools have just completed this process for admission to school next September, any changes required midstream would be hugely disruptive to schools, particularly at a time when they are contending with the current Covid-19 challenges. This Bill proposes to delete section 62(10)(b) of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018, which allows schools if they so desire - and this is an important consideration - to take into account a student's connection to a school by virtue of a parent or grandparent having previously attended the school when deciding on an application for admission to that school. This is subject to a limit of 25% on the number of available places that can be filled by a school using this criterion. Schools continue to have discretion in their admission criteria and how they are applied, as long as they are non-discriminatory and transparent. There is no evidence available at this time that indicates that the provision the Bill before the House is proposing to delete is subject to widespread use, or indeed that any difficulties are posed for those seeking admission to schools where it is in use. Schools that are not oversubscribed must accept all applicants. Rather than opposing this Bill outright, the amendment I am proposing allows time to review the use of these admission criteria by schools in order that an informed and considered view of this proposed legislation can be formed, based on our knowledge of the use of these criteria and their impact, if any, on school admissions. Importantly, the approach I am proposing avoids disrupting and delaying the school admissions processes for 2021-22 which are already under way in schools. I am sure the Deputies will agree with me that schools and school leaders are working tirelessly at this time to lead our school communities through the challenges of Covid-19. This timed amendment avoids unnecessarily adding to the workloads of schools at this time. This is a reasonable approach given the challenges that schools are operating in at present. Information on how many schools will choose to invoke this 25% provision and its impact or otherwise on school enrolment will only become apparent when it becomes operational in September 2021. This amendment seeks merely to provide for an opportunity to review the use of these admissions criteria in order that an informed view of this proposed legislation can take place.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-11-05	dail	33	Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_23	In Deputy Ó Ríordáin's absence, I absolutely accept his bona fides in introducing this Bill and his good intentions. In the interest of fairness, my motivation in moving this amendment is equally well intentioned. I have listened to the Deputies with interest. I must point out and, indeed, take exception to remarks that have been made about not alone my party but also the Government in which I serve in respect of the value and importance we place on education. No one recognises or prioritises more the importance of education than the current Government. That is an indisputable fact, considering the package of resources and measures it has put in place. In excess of €400 million has been put in place for Covid measures within our schools. A budget just short of €9 billion in resources is being introduced for the benefit of our schools. The measures included in the budget, as Deputy Gannon mentioned, ensure that the pupil-teacher ratio will fall from 26:1 to 25:1. The budget also caters for a reduction by three points in the enrolment entitlement to retain a teacher. Equally, 1,065 additional posts are being made available, 400 of which will be for teachers who will work with children with special educational needs, to which Deputies have referred. There will be almost 1,000 additional SNAs, bringing the number within our school system to a record high of 18,000. A sum of €740 million is being made available to provide 200 building projects and an additional 145 projects, 200 of which will be completed in 2021, a further 145 of which will begin by July 2021. There are other supports I could mention, such as a package of DEIS supports, but I will not go on. I wish to make clear, however, the determination and focus of the Government on education. It has been alluded to on numerous occasions by the Government that it is a number one priority. That can be seen in the delivery even thus far, in the early stages of the Government that was formed on 27 June. Specifically, I have moved this amendment because schools are currently undertaking their admission processes for the 2021-22 school year in accordance with their agreed and published admissions policies. It would, therefore, be hugely disruptive to schools and their communities to delete the provision as proposed in the Bill at this time. As I have previously outlined, the Act requires that any changes made to the published admissions policy of a school require consultation within the school community, redrafting and approval and publication by the board. At the current time in particular, this would cause an increase in workload for schools, as I am sure all the Deputies would appreciate. Equally, it would be premature to accept the Bill, which proposes to delete section 62(10)( To reiterate, information as to how many schools will choose to invoke this 25% provision and its impact or otherwise on school enrolment will only become apparent when it becomes operational in September 2021. This amendment seeks only to allow an opportunity to review the use of this admissions criterion in order that an informed and considered view of this proposed legislation can take place.	spk_254

It was the intention to open the community college in the newly constructed community national school building in September 2020 but, unfortunately, that has not proved possible. Greystones Community College opened its doors to 64 first year students on Friday, 28 August 2020 in Greystones Lawn Tennis Club. The school, Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, and my Department are grateful to Greystones Lawn Tennis Club for facilitating Greystones Community College. I wish to acknowledge the efforts of the entire school community in preparing the accommodation for the school's opening in these particularly difficult and trying circumstances. A licence agreement is in place for this interim accommodation with a commencement date of 17 August 2020 until the end of December 2020. Senior Department officials met KWETB and Greystones Community College on Wednesday, 23 September to discuss the school's current arrangements and the immediate and future accommodation requirements of the school. My Department has agreed to look at all potential options in the area in the short and medium term ahead of the school's move to its designated permanent site in Charlesland, Greystones. This will include the provision of appropriate temporary accommodation, including specialist rooms, as quickly as possible as the current school year progresses. Officials of my Department will continue to work closely with KWETB and the school to ensure that the needs of the school community will be met. Department officials, along with the school and KWETB, met Greystones Lawn Tennis Club on Monday, 28 September 2020 to discuss and request an extension to the existing arrangements. The tennis club has agreed to extend the current licence agreement until the end of December 2020 and is willing to consider extending beyond that if so required. The school and KWETB are aware of this development. In the meantime, my Department continues to work on exploring options for further interim specialist accommodation for the school. Department officials have been in discussion with Greystones Rugby Club and the club has agreed to allow for further temporary accommodation on its site to meet additional needs for either of the schools should this be required. The Department will progress this as necessary over the coming weeks in consultation with the schools and the ETB. The building project to deliver a permanent new 1,000-pupil school for Greystones Community College is planned for the designated post-primary site at Charlesland, as was said. My Department is committed to delivering this site for the new post-primary school for the Greystones and Kilcoole area of County Wicklow and work is ongoing to achieve that as soon as possible. Discussions are ongoing with the landowner with a view to acquiring the site. As the Deputies will appreciate, any site acquisition process may be lengthy and there may be complex issues which need to be addressed during negotiations, technical assessments or conveyancing. At all times, my Department must strive to obtain best value for the Exchequer while seeking to complete the acquisition as quickly and efficiently as possible. The project to deliver permanent accommodation for the school is to be delivered under my Department's design and build programme. As soon as there is sufficient certainty in respect of completion of the site acquisition, the architectural planning and design stage will be completed and, following grant of planning permission, the project will be expedited to tender and construction stages.  The letter referred to by Deputy Whitmore was not forwarded to my Department by the contractor. However, the Department has had sight of the letter. There are several inaccuracies in that communication. Notwithstanding that, there has been ongoing communication between my Department and the contractor. Certain information was provided by the contractor at the end of September. In October, the Department informed the contractor that further information was required. That was provided at the end of October and is currently being adjudicated on.	spk_162

I am keenly aware of the vital contribution by school secretaries to the school life of our communities, and I recognise the very important work they do, and indeed the work of the other support staff, in the running of our schools. I have met with Fórsa, which represents many of the secretaries working in our schools. In recognition of their role, I have put special arrangements in place for the coming school year, whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff, who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from Covid-19, cannot work on the school premises. I have also extended the employee assistance service to all school staff, including secretaries. On foot of a chairman’s note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019, and that a minimum hourly pay rate of €13 be phased in over that period. The Fórsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and school management bodies met with Fórsa on 1 October under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. I am very keen that all parties resume meaningful discussion in the WRC with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution. In that respect, I have asked my officials to examine closely pay issues for secretaries and caretakers, as well as very important wider matters relating to their conditions of work, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The WRC process remains ongoing, and I support the continued engagement between all parties in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution.	spk_2

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_3	The decision to adopt a model of calculated grades by my Department was a result of Covid-19 and the circumstances that prevailed at the time in question, which prevented the State from running the conventional leaving certificate examinations this year. The system of calculated grades is complex and sophisticated. It had to be developed from scratch, specifically for the leaving certificate and within an extremely tight timeframe, in order for students to get their calculated grade results in time. Results were issued on 7 September 2020, and this ensured that deadlines for the Central Applications Office, CAO, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service and other jurisdictions’ college entry systems would be met insofar as possible. On 3 October, I announced that 6,100 leaving certificate students would later that day receive details of improved calculated grades following the correction of errors found in the coding used as part of the calculated grades process. As part of the round 4 offers made by the CAO on 8 October, some 485 of these students received a CAO offer on foot of their improved grades. Each of these students will be able to take up his or her offer in the current academic year. I also announced on 3 October that I had asked for a comprehensive independent review of the design and implementation of the calculated grades process to take place when the process is complete.  I want the independent comprehensive review to consider key aspects of the calculated grades process. This will include the initial decision to adopt the calculated grades model; the question of whether the process met its objectives; the effectiveness of the process; how the process worked in terms of design and implementation; and the effectiveness of the governance and oversight procedures. Importantly, I also want the review to include the lessons that can be learned. The full scope of the review will be set out very clearly in advance.	spk_8
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy.

The terms of reference will be set out and made available well in advance. The review will consider whether the calculated grades process met its objectives. It will raise questions as to how effective the process was in its entirety. The scope will be clearly set out and agreed in advance, and it will identify lessons for the future. It will examine how the decision was reached to develop a calculated grades model for leaving certificate 2020 when it became apparent that the traditional leaving certificate examinations were not possible in light of the health and safety advice at the time; the context in which the calculated grades model was developed and the impact on stakeholders; the calculated grades model's design, development and implementation; and governance and oversight procedures.

There is unanimous agreement that this is a very positive step forward to the benefit of our schools. With regard to the DEIS schools, the Deputy is correct that there are different bands. In the junior cycle, there is a ratio of 20:1. It is 24:1 at the higher end, that is, in third, fourth, fifth and sixth classes. Where juniors and seniors are together, it is 22:1. It varies. A substantial DEIS package of €5 million has been made available as part of the budget. Aspects of that will include the school staffing schedule.	spk_12
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_3	The Department has published guidelines to support schools in making adapted education provision for those children who cannot return to school because they are medically certified as being at very high risk to Covid-19. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the HSE have published guidance on the return to school of at-risk groups. The advice confirms that the vast majority of children can return to school and it is important for the overall health and well-being of children to attend school. This guidance provides that children with immediate family members, including parents, in the high-risk and very high-risk categories can return to school and that this is important for the child's overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally on at-risk family members. The best way to protect against Covid-19 is for households to continue to follow all current public health advice on how to minimise the risk of infection. This includes regular hand washing, cough etiquette and social distancing. It should be noted that the public health evidence regarding the initial return to school is positive and highlights that schools are relatively low-risk environments for Covid-19. This is confirmed on a regular basis. My Department has in place an enhanced occupational health service, OHS. The current OHS provider is Medmark Occupational Healthcare Limited. Medmark has a process in place for school staff with health concerns about the risk to them of serious illness from contracting Covid-19 through workplace attendance. The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors. To date, more than 1,700 teachers, SNAs and school staff have been assessed by Medmark under this scheme. A person who is not satisfied with the outcome of this process may apply to have the case reviewed by a further panel of medical experts. The Department has developed and prepared a comprehensive response to support the well-being of school communities. NEPS is working with schools to support them to meet the needs of their pupils, especially pupils who are anxious at this time.	spk_27
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_3	I absolutely appreciate that this is an anxious time for everyone across all sectors of society. We must acknowledge as well that everything that can be done is being done, especially within our school environment. All the measures that need to be put in place within our schools have been put in place. The resources that were necessary have been put in place. It is a tribute to the manner in which those aspects are being implemented by school communities throughout the country that we can say schools are safe places. This has been confirmed nationally and internationally. I appreciate the categorisation of at risk and very high risk. That categorisation is implemented by Medmark. Medmark is following the same strategy or categorisation that has been implemented throughout the public service. We are no different within the school environment. It is best practice to follow what is being followed by others on the front line, including our nurses and doctors.	spk_29

Individuals who wish to have their case reviewed have the opportunity for that and to provide, if they wish, updated or new medical evidence that may be assessed. In the first instance, some 1,785 people applied to be considered within the process. A total of 913 were categorised as very high risk, 802 were classified as high risk and 70 were categorised as normal risk. A total of 327 applied for a review of the classification. Of that 327, some 16% were placed into different categories. Again, the process that is being employed here is being employed across the public sector. We are no different within the education field.

It will examine how the decision was reached to develop a calculated grades model for leaving certificate 2020 when it became apparent that the traditional leaving certificate examinations were not possible in light of the health and safety advice at the time; the context in which the calculated grades model was developed and the impact on stakeholders; the calculated grades model's design, development and implementation; and governance and oversight procedures. It will allow for a full opportunity to consider all aspects.	spk_10

There is unanimous agreement that this is a very positive step forward to the benefit of our schools. With regard to the DEIS schools, the Deputy is correct that there are different bands. In the junior cycle, there is a ratio of 20:1. It is 24:1 at the higher end, that is, in third, fourth, fifth and sixth classes. Where juniors and seniors are together, it is 22:1. It varies. A substantial DEIS package of €5 million has been made available as part of the budget. Aspects of that will include the school staffing schedule.	spk_12
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_8	The Department has published guidelines to support schools in making adapted education provision for those children who cannot return to school because they are medically certified as being at very high risk to Covid-19. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the HSE have published guidance on the return to school of at-risk groups. The advice confirms that the vast majority of children can return to school and it is important for the overall health and well-being of children to attend school. This guidance provides that children with immediate family members, including parents, in the high-risk and very high-risk categories can return to school and that this is important for the child's overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally on at-risk family members. The best way to protect against Covid-19 is for households to continue to follow all current public health advice on how to minimise the risk of infection. This includes regular hand washing, cough etiquette and social distancing. It should be noted that the public health evidence regarding the initial return to school is positive and highlights that schools are relatively low-risk environments for Covid-19. This is confirmed on a regular basis. My Department has in place an enhanced occupational health service, OHS. The current OHS provider is Medmark Occupational Healthcare Limited. Medmark has a process in place for school staff with health concerns about the risk to them of serious illness from contracting Covid-19 through workplace attendance. The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors. To date, more than 1,700 teachers, SNAs and school staff have been assessed by Medmark under this scheme. A person who is not satisfied with the outcome of this process may apply to have the case reviewed by a further panel of medical experts. The Department has developed and prepared a comprehensive response to support the well-being of school communities. NEPS is working with schools to support them to meet the needs of their pupils, especially pupils who are anxious at this time.	spk_27
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_8	I absolutely appreciate that this is an anxious time for everyone across all sectors of society. We must acknowledge as well that everything that can be done is being done, especially within our school environment. All the measures that need to be put in place within our schools have been put in place. The resources that were necessary have been put in place. It is a tribute to the manner in which those aspects are being implemented by school communities throughout the country that we can say schools are safe places. This has been confirmed nationally and internationally. I appreciate the categorisation of at risk and very high risk. That categorisation is implemented by Medmark. Medmark is following the same strategy or categorisation that has been implemented throughout the public service. We are no different within the school environment. It is best practice to follow what is being followed by others on the front line, including our nurses and doctors.	spk_29

It is only right and proper that there would be an opportunity for a review of any decision. That mechanism is in place. It is an independent review by medical experts. Individuals who wish to have their case reviewed have the opportunity for that and to provide, if they wish, updated or new medical evidence that may be assessed. In the first instance, some 1,785 people applied to be considered within the process. A total of 913 were categorised as very high risk, 802 were classified as high risk and 70 were categorised as normal risk. A total of 327 applied for a review of the classification. Of that 327, some 16% were placed into different categories. Again, the process that is being employed here is being employed across the public sector. We are no different within the education field. The classification has been applied to those who are on the front line, including nurses and doctors, etc.	spk_31
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	As Minister for Education and Skills, I am committed to ensuring the State examinations of 2021 operate as normally as possible, subject to the prevailing public health advice at that time. This commitment is shared by the State Examinations Commission, SEC, which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. It continues to be a priority for the Government to keep our schools open now that they have been reopened. The Department of Education and Skills has put in place a comprehensive range of measures to support schools in this effort.The Department has ongoing engagement with the public health authorities so that schools can remain open safely and is working with the partners in education to ensure this is a shared objective. I am very pleased to confirm that, from the very beginning, it has been a shared objective. In addition, the Department has published a range of documentation and support material as part of the roadmap for the full return to school for the 2020 to 2021 academic year. This includes the document entitled, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, which sets out the assessment changes for the 2021 State examinations. These arrangements take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during this past academic year 2019 to 2020 and makes accommodation should there be any gaps for the 2020 to 2021 school year, as a contingency measure. The adjustments play to students' strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. There will be no change to the length of the written examinations. Project briefs for relevant subjects will issue earlier than usual and practical coursework will be submitted two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. Teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study. These changes to the leaving certificate assessment arrangements for 2021 will provide reassurance to students, their parents and guardians and teachers and schools. As I said, it is the intention that provision is made through the assessment of the curriculum going forward.	spk_33
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	I confirm again to the Deputy that I am absolutely committed to ensuring the State examinations of 2021 will operate what we might call traditionally and as normal. This is a commitment shared, as I said, by the State Examinations Commission which has statutory responsibility for operating the exams. We are moving in that direction, as the Deputy outlined. There is an absolute commitment from the Government and, indeed, it became very clear at the weekend, from wider society also, that schools would remain open and it is a shared objective. Again, it is a particularly strong shared objective with the partners in education. In recognising that commitment to move forward and to progress as normally as we can in extraordinary times, we are doing all we can to ensure schools will remain open and remain open safely. Accommodation has been made for the adjudication of the 2021 leaving certificate in terms of the exam paper, the wider choices and issues like that will be identified on the day for students.	spk_35
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	The Deputy is quite correct that more than 2,800 students have registered to take the exam in November. It is important that option was made available to students. They will also have the opportunity, when they have completed those exams, to take whichever of the grades suits or advantages them best, be it the calculated grade they received or the final grade they will get for the written exam. The exams are being scheduled at times to best meet the needs of the students, in that they are taking place in evenings and over weekends. Again, that is an accommodation for students recognising that they have perhaps moved on and are doing other things. It is a recognition that it is important that they would be accommodated in making the times most appropriate. Measures are also being put in place to ensure that these exams take place locally within their schools which are settings they are familiar with. All financial resources and supports required by the schools are being put in place for the benefit of the schools to allow them to do that.	spk_37

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	In order to plan for school provision and analysis of the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, GIS, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels. Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential developments, which the Deputy will appreciate. Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools or provision of a new school or schools. Under Project Ireland 2040, the Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector in order to meet demographic and other demands. Following an assessment of the Galway city school planning area in which the school referred to by the Deputy is situated, the Department is satisfied that there is adequate capacity available or planned to cater for projected enrolments and therefore an extension to this particular school is not required.	spk_43
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	It is my understanding that there are 11 other post-primary schools in the Galway city school planning area. It is also my understanding that the demographic analysis is correct in terms of using geographical information systems and using data from a range of sources which identifies where the pressures for schools places across the country will arise. With this information the Department has carried out a demographic exercise. In regard to what the Deputy is talking about, that is, the additional school accommodation needed, it is the view of the Department that sufficient places are available in the post-primary schools in the area to meet demand, although I appreciate the case the Deputy has made for the school in question. The long-term projected enrolment in the Galway city school planning area is set to peak at 7,839 in 2024. On the completion of planned capital projects, there will be capacity to cater for 8,697 post-primary pupils which will also cater for additional housing developments in the area.	spk_45
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	I do not take from the genuine case that the Deputy is making for this school, nor do I dispute the figures she has given. I must say that the Department, in looking at all the available options, is satisfied that sufficient places are available for all post-primary pupils in the school planning area, going forward. However, I will say to the Deputy that the planning and building unit of the Department is currently reviewing all 314 school planning areas to ensure that all pupils will have places, going forward, and the school in question will be a part of that review.	spk_47
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	The SEC, which has operational responsibility for the State examinations, has informed me that some 2,800 candidates have applied to sit the November 2020 leaving certificate written examinations. These exams will commence on Monday, 16 November, subject to public health advice. To ensure comparability with the calculated grades system, the examinations will be based on the normal question paper format, content, structure and duration as in previous years. Candidates will be graded on the basis of their written papers only, except for five subjects where project work had been completed prior to school closure last March and these marks will be included in the grading of these subjects. The marking of the November examinations will rely principally on the expert judgment of the SEC chief examiner and members of the senior examining team, based on the content of the examination papers and the demands of the marking scheme. This expert judgment approach will ensure that the standards applied in the marking of these examinations will be fair and valid for these candidates who form a small subset of the overall candidature for leaving certificate 2020. The SEC sets out the national standard for the leaving certificate and other examinations and operates independently of my Department. Leaving certificate candidates sitting the written examinations in November who opted to receive calculated grades will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the calculated grade and the written examination. These results will have the same status as the leaving certificate results for previous years. The 2020 applicants to the Central Applications Office, CAO, will have their final leaving certificate results forwarded to the CAO, using their best results of the November examinations and their calculated grades, where applicable. They will receive any relevant CAO offers that their results indicate as a deferred CAO offer for the 2021-2022 school year.	spk_49
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	I thank both Deputies. To put their questions in context, the prevailing circumstances of the pandemic at the time meant that it was not possible to house the traditional exams as they are normally experienced. The Deputies will recall that in April, the written exams were deferred until July. On 8 May, a further decision was taken because of the pandemic that it was not possible for those exams to be sat in July and the calculated grade model was introduced. That model was first mooted by students and, following consultation with partners in education, it became the agreed model. The importance that the 2020 students would be afforded an opportunity to have a pathway forward to take up whatever opportunities in life they wished was recognised. The only mechanism to do that at the time was the calculated grades process. That was the reason the calculated grades process was introduced. As the Deputy outlined, the students who will undertake the leaving certificate exams in November have already left school and it is not possible for the schools to re-engage with them. It is in the interests of the students that they would have the opportunity to choose between the calculated grades process and the exam process, and that is why the November exams were put in place. That was a part of the original agreement in May and will be the process, going forward.	spk_52
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	I reiterate that the reason the exams did not take place at the traditional time, which would have been June, or the deferred time, which would have been July, was because of the prevailing circumstances at that time. It was not possible at the time, under public health advice, for exams to take place. For that reason, the calculated grades process and the opportunity to take the written exams in November were introduced. I am not clear on the Deputy's point. Is she asserting that the exams in November should not take place? I think it is right and proper that the opportunity is afforded to students, should they wish to avail of it, and they can then choose between the calculated grades process and written exams process, whichever benefits them most. The marking of the November exams will rely principally on the expert judgment of the SEC chief examiner and members of the senior examining team, based on the content of the exam papers and demands of the marking scheme. This expert judgment approach will ensure that the standards applied in the marking of these examinations will be fair and valid for these candidates, who form a small subset of the overall candidature for leaving certificate 2020.	spk_54
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy for his question. The staffing schedule is an allocation mechanism that uses enrolment bands to determine the number of classroom teaching posts allocated to a school. This is a long-standing arrangement, as the Deputy will be aware, for allocating teaching posts to our primary schools in a fair and equitable way based on their respective enrolment. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of their location. For the 2020-21 school year at primary level it operates on the basis of one classroom teacher for an average of every 26 pupils, which is historically the lowest level. I am very pleased to say, as the Deputy himself has mentioned, that under budget 2021 as announced yesterday, that this will be further reduced to a ratio of 25:1 from September 2021. The staffing arrangements for primary schools also include a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolments for the following September. The school referred to by the Deputy was allocated a temporary teaching post on this basis as the school had indicated that it was expecting an enrolment of 334 students in September 2020, which was a projected increase of 39 pupils. My Department has recently received an enrolment return of 277 pupils from this school as at 30 September and it is clear that the school has not experienced a growth in enrolments. Instead, its overall school enrolment has gone down from last year. This school is 57 pupils below what it had indicated as its projected enrolment for September. The school has submitted an appeal to the primary staffing appeals board which will be considered at its meeting later this month which is the usual process, as the Deputy will be aware. This process is ongoing and the school will be informed of the board's decision in due course.	spk_56
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	I thank both Deputies. As I have already outlined, the school staffing schedule is 26:1 and will in the future be 25:1. I acknowledge, as referred to by both Deputies, the current situation with Covid-19 and I confirm again that a substantial package of measures was put in place to ensure that schools could operate as advised under the safe schools reopening plan. A package in excess of €375 million, which has been increased in recent months, was made available. Among the package of supports was minor works programme funding, which was given to schools so that space could be reconfigured within schools and general purpose areas reimagined as required to give the additional capacity. Equally the substitution panel was introduced for the primary schools so that in an instance where a teacher was unavailable to work, a substitute would be available immediately and classes would not have to be subdivided. I reiterate that the appeals process that is in place is working independently. The adjudication from that appeals process will be issued in the next number of weeks.	spk_59
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy. As she will be aware, under the programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil-teacher ratios in primary schools. The budgets of 2016 and 2018 improved the staffing schedule by one point on both occasions to its historically lowest level ever of one teacher to 26 pupils. I was delighted to build further on this progress yesterday by announcing a further one-point reduction in yesterday’s budget. The staffing schedule for the next academic year now stands at one teacher for every 25 pupils, which is a historically low figure in this country. This measure will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that fewer pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. There is no change in the current school year to the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy in the question submitted by her. The school staffing schedule for 2021-22 will be published next year, and at that stage, schools will be able to establish their staffing arrangements for the following school year. The staffing process, as I have outlined earlier, includes an appeals mechanism where schools that might not be satisfied have an opportunity to submit a staffing appeal to an independent appeals board. The published appeal criteria include the specific criteria for small schools, and schools are entitled to make such an appeal to the independent board.	spk_61
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy and reiterate that there has been an unprecedented financial package allocated to the schools sector in recent months which is in excess of €375 million. This is unprecedented and never before were resources of that nature allocated to the education sector. This underlines the determination and commitment of the Government to recognise the great importance of the role played by the education sector in our society. That commitment was continued yesterday, as referred to by the Deputy, with the opportunity to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio from 26:1 to 25:1. Substantial progress has been made in recent years, given that in the 2019-20 school year the average pupil-teacher ratio was 15:1.The EU class size is 1:20. We are slowly but surely making our way towards that ratio. I would assume the package that was introduced yesterday will positively enhance all schools going forward. In regard to the school referenced by the Deputy, there is no change to the staffing of the school in the current school year. When the staffing schedule for 2021-22 is published early next year I am sure that the school referenced by the Deputy and other schools will be able to establish their staffing arrangements for the year going forward.	spk_63
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 all schools must have drafted new school admission policies. These new policies have been approved by the respective patrons and are now published on individual school websites. They will apply for admissions to schools from September 2021 onwards. The Act requires schools to set out clearly their selection criteria in their admissions policies. Schools and their patrons have discretion in regard to their admission criteria and how they are applied once it is non-discriminatory and deemed to be fair. If a school wishes to include a selection criterion for siblings, it can do so, as it is permitted under the Act. The criteria are to be applied by schools and the order of priority is a matter for school themselves. Patrons of schools, including the Archdiocese of Dublin, are not required to consult or seek approval from the Department of Education in regard to their selection criteria. However, the archdiocese has informed the Department that its position is that the siblings, step-siblings and-or children of the parish remain in the first category for the allocation of places. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can between them cater for all pupils seeking places. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applications than places available, a selection process may be necessary and may be carried out and this may result in some students not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.	spk_65
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	I will forward the information to the Deputy. I would like to reiterate the obligations here.

If a school wishes to include a selection criterion for siblings, it can do so as it is permitted under the existing Act. The criteria are to be applied by schools and the order of priority is a matter for the schools themselves. The patrons, including the Archdiocese of Dublin, are not required to consult or seek approval from the Department of Education in regard to their selection criteria. The archdiocese has informed the Department that its position is that the siblings, step-siblings and-or children of the parish remain in the first category for the allocation of places, notwithstanding the points made by the Department in regard to oversubscribed schools.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has published guidance to support schools in making adapted education provision for pupils who cannot return to school because they are medically certified as being at very high risk due to Covid-19. It is important that pupils in these circumstances maintain a meaningful connection with their class and school to continue their learning from home successfully. Schools have discretion to manage and redistribute their teaching support resources to best meet the learning needs of these pupils. Supports may include a teacher who is also certified as very high risk to Covid-19 who cannot themselves attend school and may be in a position to provide remote teaching to very high-risk students. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and HSE have also published guidance on the return to school for at-risk groups. It outlines that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the very high-risk and high-risk categories can safely return to school, and it is important for the child’s overall well-being that they would choose to do so. This is consistent with public health advice internationally regarding at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus through regular hand washing, cough etiquette and social distancing. I am also reassured by the public health evidence to date since schools have reopened that supports the international position that schools are low-risk environments for Covid-19 and are not key drivers of transmission in the community. It is also important to acknowledge the enormous work schools have undertaken to ensure they are safe places for their pupils, and the Department has provided a suite of guidance to support schools in this work following engagement and consultation with all of the education partners in the development of this guidance.	spk_79
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	I will reiterate clearly from the outset that both the international and national evidence to date is clear that schools by their nature are safe environments. There is also an absolute recognition that the resources and measures required as part of the roadmap for the safe reopening of our schools have been put in place. I absolutely acknowledge a huge debt of gratitude is owed to the school communities in ensuring those measures are being implemented. All the expert advice available to us at the minute reiterates time and again that schools are safe environments. I acknowledge the role played by everybody to ensure that is the reality. Equally, I acknowledge that even as late as last week the evidence has shown there has been no material difference in terms of the rate of Covid-19 since before students returned to schools and once schools opened in this past month. I reiterate that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and HSE have published specific guidance regarding the return to school for risk groups. It outlines that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the high-risk and very high-risk categories, can safely return to school, and they make the point it is important for the child's overall well-being that he or she does so.	spk_81

I reiterate also that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the HSE have published guidelines on the safe return to school, particularly for children who may have family members designated to be at risk or at very high risk. It is their recommendation that schools are safe places and that in terms of the health, advancement, socialisation, academic development and all the other aspects of a child's well-being it is in their best interest that they would return to school and be catered for within the school environment.	spk_83
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_9	I reiterate that I appreciate the very valuable contribution made by school secretaries and other support staff in the school environment. I have witnessed it and I am very conscious of it. I have met with Fórsa, which represents many of the secretaries working in schools. In recognition of the school secretary role, I have put in place special arrangements for the coming school year whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from Covid-19 cannot work. I have also extended the employee assistance service to all school staff, including secretaries. On foot of the chairman’s note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, the Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator.  Fórsa tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and school management bodies met Fórsa on 1 October under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  I am very keen that all parties resume meaningful discussion in the WRC with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution. In that respect, I have asked my officials to examine closely pay issues for secretaries and caretakers, as well as very important wider matters relating to their conditions of work, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The WRC process remains ongoing, as the Deputy is aware, and I support the continued engagement of all parties in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution.	spk_86

As I said, it is the intention that provision is made through the assessment of the curriculum going forward.	spk_33
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_10	I confirm again to the Deputy that I am absolutely committed to ensuring the State examinations of 2021 will operate what we might call traditionally and as normal. This is a commitment shared, as I said, by the State Examinations Commission which has statutory responsibility for operating the exams. We are moving in that direction, as the Deputy outlined. There is an absolute commitment from the Government and, indeed, it became very clear at the weekend, from wider society also, that schools would remain open and it is a shared objective. Again, it is a particularly strong shared objective with the partners in education. In recognising that commitment to move forward and to progress as normally as we can in extraordinary times, we are doing all we can to ensure schools will remain open and remain open safely. Accommodation has been made for the adjudication of the 2021 leaving certificate in terms of the exam paper, the wider choices and issues like that will be identified on the day for students.	spk_35
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_10	The Deputy is quite correct that more than 2,800 students have registered to take the exam in November. It is important that option was made available to students. They will also have the opportunity, when they have completed those exams, to take whichever of the grades suits or advantages them best, be it the calculated grade they received or the final grade they will get for the written exam. The exams are being scheduled at times to best meet the needs of the students, in that they are taking place in evenings and over weekends. Again, that is an accommodation for students recognising that they have perhaps moved on and are doing other things. It is a recognition that it is important that they would be accommodated in making the times most appropriate. Measures are also being put in place to ensure that these exams take place locally within their schools which are settings they are familiar with. All financial resources and supports required by the schools are being put in place for the benefit of the schools to allow them to do that.	spk_37

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_11	In order to plan for school provision and analysis of the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, GIS, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels. Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential developments, which the Deputy will appreciate. Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools or provision of a new school or schools. Under Project Ireland 2040, the Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector in order to meet demographic and other demands. Following an assessment of the Galway city school planning area in which the school referred to by the Deputy is situated, the Department is satisfied that there is adequate capacity available or planned to cater for projected enrolments and therefore an extension to this particular school is not required.	spk_43
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_11	It is my understanding that there are 11 other post-primary schools in the Galway city school planning area. It is also my understanding that the demographic analysis is correct in terms of using geographical information systems and using data from a range of sources which identifies where the pressures for schools places across the country will arise. With this information the Department has carried out a demographic exercise. In regard to what the Deputy is talking about, that is, the additional school accommodation needed, it is the view of the Department that sufficient places are available in the post-primary schools in the area to meet demand, although I appreciate the case the Deputy has made for the school in question. The long-term projected enrolment in the Galway city school planning area is set to peak at 7,839 in 2024. On the completion of planned capital projects, there will be capacity to cater for 8,697 post-primary pupils which will also cater for additional housing developments in the area.	spk_45
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_11	I do not take from the genuine case that the Deputy is making for this school, nor do I dispute the figures she has given. I must say that the Department, in looking at all the available options, is satisfied that sufficient places are available for all post-primary pupils in the school planning area, going forward. However, I will say to the Deputy that the planning and building unit of the Department is currently reviewing all 314 school planning areas to ensure that all pupils will have places, going forward, and the school in question will be a part of that review.	spk_47
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_12	The SEC, which has operational responsibility for the State examinations, has informed me that some 2,800 candidates have applied to sit the November 2020 leaving certificate written examinations. These exams will commence on Monday, 16 November, subject to public health advice. To ensure comparability with the calculated grades system, the examinations will be based on the normal question paper format, content, structure and duration as in previous years. Candidates will be graded on the basis of their written papers only, except for five subjects where project work had been completed prior to school closure last March and these marks will be included in the grading of these subjects. The marking of the November examinations will rely principally on the expert judgment of the SEC chief examiner and members of the senior examining team, based on the content of the examination papers and the demands of the marking scheme. This expert judgment approach will ensure that the standards applied in the marking of these examinations will be fair and valid for these candidates who form a small subset of the overall candidature for leaving certificate 2020. The SEC sets out the national standard for the leaving certificate and other examinations and operates independently of my Department. Leaving certificate candidates sitting the written examinations in November who opted to receive calculated grades will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the calculated grade and the written examination. These results will have the same status as the leaving certificate results for previous years. The 2020 applicants to the Central Applications Office, CAO, will have their final leaving certificate results forwarded to the CAO, using their best results of the November examinations and their calculated grades, where applicable. They will receive any relevant CAO offers that their results indicate as a deferred CAO offer for the 2021-2022 school year.	spk_49
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_12	I thank both Deputies. To put their questions in context, the prevailing circumstances of the pandemic at the time meant that it was not possible to house the traditional exams as they are normally experienced. The Deputies will recall that in April, the written exams were deferred until July. On 8 May, a further decision was taken because of the pandemic that it was not possible for those exams to be sat in July and the calculated grade model was introduced. That model was first mooted by students and, following consultation with partners in education, it became the agreed model. The importance that the 2020 students would be afforded an opportunity to have a pathway forward to take up whatever opportunities in life they wished was recognised. The only mechanism to do that at the time was the calculated grades process. That was the reason the calculated grades process was introduced. As the Deputy outlined, the students who will undertake the leaving certificate exams in November have already left school and it is not possible for the schools to re-engage with them. It is in the interests of the students that they would have the opportunity to choose between the calculated grades process and the exam process, and that is why the November exams were put in place. That was a part of the original agreement in May and will be the process, going forward.	spk_52
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_12	I reiterate that the reason the exams did not take place at the traditional time, which would have been June, or the deferred time, which would have been July, was because of the prevailing circumstances at that time. It was not possible at the time, under public health advice, for exams to take place. For that reason, the calculated grades process and the opportunity to take the written exams in November were introduced. I am not clear on the Deputy's point. Is she asserting that the exams in November should not take place? I think it is right and proper that the opportunity is afforded to students, should they wish to avail of it, and they can then choose between the calculated grades process and written exams process, whichever benefits them most. The marking of the November exams will rely principally on the expert judgment of the SEC chief examiner and members of the senior examining team, based on the content of the exam papers and demands of the marking scheme. This expert judgment approach will ensure that the standards applied in the marking of these examinations will be fair and valid for these candidates, who form a small subset of the overall candidature for leaving certificate 2020.	spk_54
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_13	I thank the Deputy for his question. The staffing schedule is an allocation mechanism that uses enrolment bands to determine the number of classroom teaching posts allocated to a school. This is a long-standing arrangement, as the Deputy will be aware, for allocating teaching posts to our primary schools in a fair and equitable way based on their respective enrolment. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of their location. For the 2020-21 school year at primary level it operates on the basis of one classroom teacher for an average of every 26 pupils, which is historically the lowest level. I am very pleased to say, as the Deputy himself has mentioned, that under budget 2021 as announced yesterday, that this will be further reduced to a ratio of 25:1 from September 2021. The staffing arrangements for primary schools also include a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolments for the following September. The school referred to by the Deputy was allocated a temporary teaching post on this basis as the school had indicated that it was expecting an enrolment of 334 students in September 2020, which was a projected increase of 39 pupils. My Department has recently received an enrolment return of 277 pupils from this school as at 30 September and it is clear that the school has not experienced a growth in enrolments. Instead, its overall school enrolment has gone down from last year. This school is 57 pupils below what it had indicated as its projected enrolment for September. The school has submitted an appeal to the primary staffing appeals board which will be considered at its meeting later this month which is the usual process, as the Deputy will be aware. This process is ongoing and the school will be informed of the board's decision in due course.	spk_56
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_13	I thank both Deputies. As I have already outlined, the school staffing schedule is 26:1 and will in the future be 25:1. I acknowledge, as referred to by both Deputies, the current situation with Covid-19 and I confirm again that a substantial package of measures was put in place to ensure that schools could operate as advised under the safe schools reopening plan. A package in excess of €375 million, which has been increased in recent months, was made available. Among the package of supports was minor works programme funding, which was given to schools so that space could be reconfigured within schools and general purpose areas reimagined as required to give the additional capacity. Equally the substitution panel was introduced for the primary schools so that in an instance where a teacher was unavailable to work, a substitute would be available immediately and classes would not have to be subdivided. I reiterate that the appeals process that is in place is working independently. The adjudication from that appeals process will be issued in the next number of weeks.	spk_59
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_14	I thank the Deputy. As she will be aware, under the programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil-teacher ratios in primary schools. The budgets of 2016 and 2018 improved the staffing schedule by one point on both occasions to its historically lowest level ever of one teacher to 26 pupils. I was delighted to build further on this progress yesterday by announcing a further one-point reduction in yesterday’s budget. The staffing schedule for the next academic year now stands at one teacher for every 25 pupils, which is a historically low figure in this country. This measure will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that fewer pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. There is no change in the current school year to the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy in the question submitted by her. The school staffing schedule for 2021-22 will be published next year, and at that stage, schools will be able to establish their staffing arrangements for the following school year. The staffing process, as I have outlined earlier, includes an appeals mechanism where schools that might not be satisfied have an opportunity to submit a staffing appeal to an independent appeals board. The published appeal criteria include the specific criteria for small schools, and schools are entitled to make such an appeal to the independent board.	spk_61
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_14	I thank the Deputy and reiterate that there has been an unprecedented financial package allocated to the schools sector in recent months which is in excess of €375 million. This is unprecedented and never before were resources of that nature allocated to the education sector. This underlines the determination and commitment of the Government to recognise the great importance of the role played by the education sector in our society. That commitment was continued yesterday, as referred to by the Deputy, with the opportunity to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio from 26:1 to 25:1. Substantial progress has been made in recent years, given that in the 2019-20 school year the average pupil-teacher ratio was 15:1.The EU class size is 1:20. We are slowly but surely making our way towards that ratio. I would assume the package that was introduced yesterday will positively enhance all schools going forward. In regard to the school referenced by the Deputy, there is no change to the staffing of the school in the current school year. When the staffing schedule for 2021-22 is published early next year I am sure that the school referenced by the Deputy and other schools will be able to establish their staffing arrangements for the year going forward.	spk_63
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_15	Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 all schools must have drafted new school admission policies. These new policies have been approved by the respective patrons and are now published on individual school websites. They will apply for admissions to schools from September 2021 onwards. The Act requires schools to set out clearly their selection criteria in their admissions policies. Schools and their patrons have discretion in regard to their admission criteria and how they are applied once it is non-discriminatory and deemed to be fair. If a school wishes to include a selection criterion for siblings, it can do so, as it is permitted under the Act. The criteria are to be applied by schools and the order of priority is a matter for school themselves. Patrons of schools, including the Archdiocese of Dublin, are not required to consult or seek approval from the Department of Education in regard to their selection criteria. However, the archdiocese has informed the Department that its position is that the siblings, step-siblings and-or children of the parish remain in the first category for the allocation of places. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can between them cater for all pupils seeking places. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applications than places available, a selection process may be necessary and may be carried out and this may result in some students not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.	spk_65
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Enrolments	dbsect_15	I will forward the information to the Deputy. I would like to reiterate the obligations here. The Act requires the schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admissions policies and provides that the schools and their patrons have discretion in regard to their admissions criteria and how they are applied once it is non-discriminatory and fair. If a school wishes to include a selection criterion for siblings, it can do so as it is permitted under the existing Act. The criteria are to be applied by schools and the order of priority is a matter for the schools themselves. The patrons, including the Archdiocese of Dublin, are not required to consult or seek approval from the Department of Education in regard to their selection criteria. The archdiocese has informed the Department that its position is that the siblings, step-siblings and-or children of the parish remain in the first category for the allocation of places, notwithstanding the points made by the Department in regard to oversubscribed schools. I will ensure the documentation requested by the Deputy is provided to him.	spk_67
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_17	As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has published guidance to support schools in making adapted education provision for pupils who cannot return to school because they are medically certified as being at very high risk due to Covid-19. It is important that pupils in these circumstances maintain a meaningful connection with their class and school to continue their learning from home successfully. Schools have discretion to manage and redistribute their teaching support resources to best meet the learning needs of these pupils. Supports may include a teacher who is also certified as very high risk to Covid-19 who cannot themselves attend school and may be in a position to provide remote teaching to very high-risk students. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and HSE have also published guidance on the return to school for at-risk groups. It outlines that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the very high-risk and high-risk categories can safely return to school, and it is important for the child’s overall well-being that they would choose to do so. This is consistent with public health advice internationally regarding at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus through regular hand washing, cough etiquette and social distancing. I am also reassured by the public health evidence to date since schools have reopened that supports the international position that schools are low-risk environments for Covid-19 and are not key drivers of transmission in the community. It is also important to acknowledge the enormous work schools have undertaken to ensure they are safe places for their pupils, and the Department has provided a suite of guidance to support schools in this work following engagement and consultation with all of the education partners in the development of this guidance.	spk_79
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_17	I will reiterate clearly from the outset that both the international and national evidence to date is clear that schools by their nature are safe environments. There is also an absolute recognition that the resources and measures required as part of the roadmap for the safe reopening of our schools have been put in place. I absolutely acknowledge a huge debt of gratitude is owed to the school communities in ensuring those measures are being implemented. All the expert advice available to us at the minute reiterates time and again that schools are safe environments. I acknowledge the role played by everybody to ensure that is the reality. Equally, I acknowledge that even as late as last week the evidence has shown there has been no material difference in terms of the rate of Covid-19 since before students returned to schools and once schools opened in this past month. I reiterate that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and HSE have published specific guidance regarding the return to school for risk groups. It outlines that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the high-risk and very high-risk categories, can safely return to school, and they make the point it is important for the child's overall well-being that he or she does so.	spk_81

I reiterate also that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the HSE have published guidelines on the safe return to school, particularly for children who may have family members designated to be at risk or at very high risk. It is their recommendation that schools are safe places and that in terms of the health, advancement, socialisation, academic development and all the other aspects of a child's well-being it is in their best interest that they would return to school and be catered for within the school environment.	spk_83
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_18	I reiterate that I appreciate the very valuable contribution made by school secretaries and other support staff in the school environment. I have witnessed it and I am very conscious of it. I have met with Fórsa, which represents many of the secretaries working in schools. In recognition of the school secretary role, I have put in place special arrangements for the coming school year whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from Covid-19 cannot work. I have also extended the employee assistance service to all school staff, including secretaries. On foot of the chairman’s note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, the Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator.  Fórsa tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and school management bodies met Fórsa on 1 October under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  I am very keen that all parties resume meaningful discussion in the WRC with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution. In that respect, I have asked my officials to examine closely pay issues for secretaries and caretakers, as well as very important wider matters relating to their conditions of work, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The WRC process remains ongoing, as the Deputy is aware, and I support the continued engagement of all parties in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution.	spk_86
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-14	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 7 - General: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_21	Yesterday's budget was the first of this new Government and it demonstrates clearly our commitment to and our support for schools, and especially our students. With this significant new investment, we will continue to improve the experience of our children in education and provide improved practical supports in light of Covid-19. I am particularly pleased to announce that I have secured funding in the budget to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and class sizes. More teachers and special needs assistants will be recruited and additional funding has also been allocated to schools to meet costs relating to Covid. This includes funding for day-to-day running costs, as well as significant capital investment for our school building programme. Through this budget, we will continue to improve the experience of our children in schools and provide improved practical supports, particularly in light of the Covid pandemic. Building on the initiatives set out in the programme for Government, the budget for the Department of Education and Skills will be €8.9 billion in 2021, which is an increase of €410 million, or 5%, on 2020. The budget provides for a variety of measures. The employment of an additional 1,065 mainstream and special education needs teachers will benefit our primary, post-primary and special schools and will allow for a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio and class sizes in our primary schools. Smaller class sizes are an important support for teaching and learning in our classrooms. I have also secured funding to allow for schools at risk of losing a teacher to retain that teacher by reducing the threshold for the retention of teaching posts. Almost 1,000 additional special needs assistants, who as we all know play a vital role in meeting the care needs of students in classrooms across the country every day, will be hired. The school inclusion model pilot will be rolled out to two further community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas. This will result in additional education psychologists and therapeutic supports including speech and language therapists and occupational therapists being made available to more schools. That project is being advanced by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan. An additional €226 million in financial supports, to be provided to schools in the first half of 2021, will meet costs relating to Covid-19. This allocation is the balance of the €437 million package approved by the Government in July as part of the roadmap to reopening our schools. As with other Covid-19-related spending, funding for the academic year 2021-22 will be reviewed in line with the latest public health advice at a particular time. A central contingency reserve is being allocated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the 2021 budget, which includes funds earmarked for schools for the remainder of 2021, from late August to December 2021. I assure all Deputies present that my Department will continue to provide funding to allow schools to stay open and meet the ongoing challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. I recognise the wonderful work that school communities have done to ensure the safe reopening of our schools, and to sustain that reopening. The Government will continue to play its role in ensuring that this important work continues. Further supports are being provided as part of the DEIS programme to those schools catering for the highest concentration of educational disadvantage. This will be supported by additional funding of €2 million in 2021 and €5 million in the full year, and it will include a one point reduction in the senior schools urban band 1 staffing schedule. Additional funding for significant expansion of the arts and education programme is also included. There is also a capital allocation for new and more energy-efficient school buildings, with a €740 million allocation for 2021 under Project Ireland 2040. This funding will sustain the roll-out of projects, including those currently on-site, and those due to commence construction activity. I have secured an additional capital allocation of €80 million for the school capital programme in the current year, 2020. The additional €80 million will allow for the ICT grant and the minor works grant at primary school level to be paid out in late 2020 rather than 2021. I clearly have some key objectives to achieve in my opening budget as Minister for Education and Skills. I wanted to ensure that sufficient funding would be available to the Department to meet existing funding requirements but I also wanted to secure continued funding for schools for Covid-19. Equally, I wanted to secure an adequate capital allocation to support and sustain our ambitious school-building programme. I was also anxious to begin to implement the provisions of the programme for Government, especially relating to class sizes, special needs education and social inclusion. With the budget announced yesterday, we have made some positive progress in achieving some of these objectives. As my home county, Kerry, has a significant tourism sector, I want to reference some initiatives in the budget relating to tourism development, specifically the €55 million business continuity support for strategic tourism businesses. This, combined with the CRSS, introduced by the Minister for Finance, will help to sustain many businesses through the pandemic. In addition, the reduction of VAT for the sector to 9% will improve competitiveness and viability for businesses. Other welcome supports include the rates waiver extension and the extension of the EWSS. I am pleased with the €102 million in targeted supports for livestock farming. This includes €85 million to support sustainable beef farming and €17 million for sheep welfare. Some €80 million is being provided for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme. I welcome the allocation of €341 million for rural and community development. Budget 2021 has a number of health measures in place. I welcome the addition of 16,000 posts in the health workforce. There is €38 million for mental health services, which is important. There will be an additional 5 million hours of home supports and an additional €100 million for provision of services and supports for those with disabilities, an important sector. I welcome the €3.3 billion investment in housing, which will facilitate the single biggest social housing build, of 9,500 homes, targeted acquisitions of 800 units, and long-term leasing of 2,450 homes. Measures include €110 million for a new affordable purchase scheme and accelerated delivery of the cost rental scheme via approved housing bodies. There is €50 million for the serviced sites scheme, making thousands of homes more affordable. Overall, 6,200 affordable homes will be delivered with supports from this scheme. I acknowledge the €60 million being made available to fund adaptation grants to support older people and people with a disability to remain at home. This is an important source of funding delivered through our local authorities. Small sums of money can make a substantial difference in the quality of people's lives. I appreciate that I have limited time and thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to refer to some aspects of the current budget.	spk_192
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-07	dail	33	Northern Ireland	dbsect_15	I thank the Deputy. I am keenly aware of the vital role contributed by school secretaries in our school communities. I absolutely recognise the very important work carried out by these staff and other support staff in the running of our schools. I have met Fórsa, which represents many of the secretaries working in our schools. In recognition of their valuable role in our schools I have put in place special arrangements for the coming year, whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from Covid-19 cannot work on the school premises.I have also extended the employment assistance scheme towards school staff including secretaries. The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions, those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment actually rests with the schools. On foot of a chairman's note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of €13 be phased in over that period. Last year, the trade union, Fórsa, tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as school management bodies, are currently in discussions with Fórsa under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. I must remain cognisant of the implications arising from this claim across the wider education and public sector. An offer of a pay increase was made to Fórsa at a recent Workplace Relations Commission meeting but this was not acceptable to the union. The Workplace Relations Commission process remains ongoing. In the current circumstances, Fórsa's intention to resume strike action later this month is regrettable. Any such action will impact on the day-to-day operation of schools at this most critical time.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-07	dail	33	Industrial Disputes	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy. I am keenly aware of the vital role contributed by school secretaries in our school communities. I absolutely recognise the very important work carried out by these staff and other support staff in the running of our schools. I have met Fórsa, which represents many of the secretaries working in our schools. In recognition of their valuable role in our schools I have put in place special arrangements for the coming year, whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from Covid-19 cannot work on the school premises.I have also extended the employment assistance scheme towards school staff including secretaries. The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions, those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment actually rests with the schools. On foot of a chairman's note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of €13 be phased in over that period. Last year, the trade union, Fórsa, tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as school management bodies, are currently in discussions with Fórsa under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. I must remain cognisant of the implications arising from this claim across the wider education and public sector. An offer of a pay increase was made to Fórsa at a recent Workplace Relations Commission meeting but this was not acceptable to the union. The Workplace Relations Commission process remains ongoing. In the current circumstances, Fórsa's intention to resume strike action later this month is regrettable. Any such action will impact on the day-to-day operation of schools at this most critical time. It could further disrupt tuition for students who have only recently returned to school after a six-month gap.	spk_215

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	I am grateful to the Business Committee for scheduling this opportunity and this session so quickly. Yesterday was a very difficult day for the leaving certificate class of 2020. The announcement that was made has inevitably generated much anxiety and worry for them. While the announcement yesterday was important, we could not provide all of the answers to their questions at that time. I apologise sincerely once again to the leaving certificate class of 2020 for what has happened. Deputies will be aware that two errors in the calculated grade system for this year’s leaving certificate have been identified. They are errors that should not have occurred. I am very clear on that point. As part of work being done for the leaving certificate applied fifth year cohort, an inconsistency in how the data was performing was detected by Polymetrika International Inc., the contractor for the calculated grades process. Polymetrika contacted the calculated grades office on Tuesday evening to notify it that the inconsistency had been identified. It was agreed immediately that Polymetrika would seek to investigate this anomaly further and report back to the calculated grades executive office the following morning. This report was received by the calculated grades executive office on Wednesday morning and identified that Polymetrika had made a mistake in the writing of code for the standardisation process. On Wednesday afternoon last, I was told that a mistake had been identified by Polymetrika. At that point, we knew that one line out of 50,000 lines of code had a mistake in it. We knew that mistake would impact on the results of some students but we did not know exactly how many would be affected. We knew it was important to find out as much as possible about the error before making an announcement. Polymetrika and the calculated grades executive office then began a detailed analysis of 50,000 lines of code, affecting more than 400,000 exam results. The system was meant to take a number of factors into account in computing the leaving certificate results. Among these were the results of the students' junior cycle examinations, which were considered at an aggregated class level. It is important to say that the junior cycle results of individuals were not used to predict or influence their leaving certificate results. The data was to be used at an aggregated class level. The system was meant to draw on the core subjects of Irish, English and maths and combine them with students' two best non-core subjects. The coding error instead combined them with the students' two weakest non-core subjects. In the course of the review which the calculated grades executive office immediately undertook on Friday, staff found a further error in the code. The results relating to civic, social and political education, CSPE, were meant to be disregarded by the system. They were not. They had been included in error. Following discovery of the second error, the calculated grades executive office undertook a detailed walk-through, taking every parameter and rule underpinning the standardisation model and verifying, in conjunction with the contractor, that it was working correctly. While nothing further was found as a result of this exercise, I wanted a further level of assurance. As such, I instructed my Department to seek an independent expert to review the code, most importantly of all, to give our students the assurance they would now require. My Department has engaged Educational Testing Service, ETS, to provide a review to offer an independent expert opinion on the adequacy of the coding. Furthermore, it is my intention that a full review of the calculated grades process will be conducted in due course. ETS is a US-based not-for-profit organisation that conducts research and develops assessment programmes such as the scholastic assessment test, SAT. ETS is one of the largest testing and assessment services in the world. It develops and administers more than 50 million achievement and admissions tests each year at more than 9,000 locations in the United States and 180 other countries. We expect to have the outcome of ETS's work as soon as possible and I will make that information available at the earliest opportunity. While we do not yet have the final figures, and we will not have them until the independent review which is under way has been completed, our checks to date indicate that the error has affected approximately 7,200 grades. There were over 400,000 calculated grades in total issued on 7 September. As a result of both errors, approximately 6,500 students received at least one result which was one grade lower than they should have. That has been rectified. In addition to the students who received lower grades than they should have in this year's leaving certificate, some students received higher grades. They will not be affected in any way; their grades stand. Those who received lower grades will have their proper grades restored. When all the grades are completed, we will issue the corrected results to the students affected. As soon as it is possible to do so, every student will be contacted by text message and informed whether they are impacted upon. Those who are affected will be directed to the calculated grades student portal, where they will find a new statement of provisional results, which will replace the one they received on 7 September. I would have liked to have had complete and final answers to all of the issues so that I would not be leaving students with questions once the issue was announced. I would also like to have had the certainty that everything had been cross-checked but that would have taken further days. We were conscious that the Central Applications Office, CAO, was issuing round three on Thursday and might need to incorporate what our analysis had revealed in their plans. The decision was therefore made to inform CAO on Wednesday morning of what we knew at that point and to call a press conference at 4 p.m. that day. Furthermore, a dedicated helpline for students was set up within my Department. This came into operation at 4 p.m. yesterday. All students received a text message yesterday advising them that an issue had arisen with the calculated grades. The Opposition were briefed in advance of the press conference. The information I have outlined here is available to students on  The announcement I made yesterday changes things for students. Even if for many of them it improves their situation, it should not have happened. On behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, I apologise sincerely to our leaving certificate students for the situation we are now in and for the upset it has caused. I appreciate that students and their families now want to know what happens next. The results data have now been rerun through the corrected model.Once the review by ETS has been completed and the results are finalised, the Department will have full information on which students will benefit from improved grades and which specific subjects are involved for each student. The Department will then contact all students, advising them when they will receive a higher grade or grades, or whether they are not impacted. The Department will send a corrected file of student results to the CAO in order that it can work with higher educational institutions to determine if a student is due a new offer and to do everything possible to facilitate his or her admission. Any student who would have been entitled to a different offer in previous CAO rounds if he or she had received the correct grade on 7 September will receive this offer or a deferred offer as soon as is practicable under the updated results. Equally, if students receive improved offers but would like to defer their places until next year, I would encourage them to contact the institutions concerned in order to establish if deferral is possible. It is important to say that this is in line with the practice that occurs in the appeals process every year. Where a student who has already started college receives a deferred offer as a result of an upgrade, the student can continue in his or her existing course this year and, in respect of next year, remain eligible for free fees and Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, funding as if he or she was starting college for the first time. Any student who had applied to a higher educational institution outside the State who believes his or her grade change will impact upon those arrangements can contact the Department through a dedicated email address,  Students continue to have the option to register for the postponed written examinations. These will commence on 16 November. The closing date for this registration was to be tomorrow at 5 p.m. I have asked the State Examinations Commission to extend that registration deadline until next Wednesday. I acknowledge that students have had an exceptionally difficult year and they have coped unbelievably well with the challenges posed by Covid-19. As was confirmed by the Taoiseach to the House yesterday, we will do everything to support students who now have the chance to change their course and might wish to do so.	spk_379
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	The Deputy asked when the information was disseminated. As he is aware, the anomaly was first discovered on Tuesday of last week and the calculated grades office was informed. All that the office was informed of at that stage was that there was an anomaly. It was worked on through the night and on Wednesday morning an official of the Department was informed by the calculated grades office and the Secretary General was informed in the morning. I was then informed on Wednesday afternoon. At that point, what we knew was that an issue had arisen. That issue was an error in the code. Information about how many students it impacted, what its scope and potential might be, and who the affected students might be was not available. It was necessary that further and continuous checks be run to ensure that we had all of the information available so that we could make it available, as I accept is necessary. Following further checks on Friday, a second error was identified. At that stage, I sought and received an opportunity to source external expertise and oversight on the errors that had arisen. That was secured through a company called ETS from the United States, whose staff are international experts in the field of statistics, psychometrics and educational testing. Those checks are still running and theirs are the third pairs of eyes, if you like, on the process, along with the contractor and the calculates grades office. We were aware that CAO offers were becoming available on Wednesday and we made the decision at that stage, as I have outlined, to release not the full information, because we still do not have it, but the information we had at that point. When we did not have the full information, it was impossible to make the information available. I wish there was more information available but we did make available on Wednesday, as soon as we had concrete data, the information that we had at the time.	spk_383

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	It is my understanding that before any decision was taken to postpone the State examinations, Polymetrika had been engaged by the State Examinations Commission to advise on calculated grades. That was part of the State Examinations Commission's contingency plans. The decision to postpone the examinations was taken by the then Minister on 8 May and calculated grades was the process with which it was chosen to move forward. In order for the calculated grade model to be of value to students, it was known that results had to be issued by early September to make Irish and international deadlines for entry to higher and further education. There was no time to run a normal, full procurement process, as I understand it. The area of psychometrics and field of educational testing are highly specialised.	spk_387

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	To clarify, the seriousness of the situation is not in any way underestimated. I would say to the Deputy that at all points I acknowledge that the primacy and principle in the situation is and has always been the students and their best interests. In terms of not getting the basic detail right, in an ideal world there would be no mistakes and no errors. We do not live in an ideal world. Therefore, mistakes and errors can occur. It is very important that when an error occurs or a mistake is made, every possible proactive action that needs to be taken to correct that error is taken, and that is what is occurring now.	spk_398
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	 I acknowledge - the Deputy has referred to the whole calculated grades process - that many people had principled objections to it and voiced those, including many teachers, and they put these to one side in what was an extraordinary time when there was a need to introduce an extraordinary measure because of the pandemic. I salute the teachers who made it possible and put aside their objections and did it in the best interests of their students. I fully accept what the Deputy is saying in that regard. I am conscious of time but I will deal specifically with the question the Deputy raised in respect of students who may have taken up one particular offer and may now, as a consequence, be in a position to receive a higher preference offer, and I will give this issue some context. Last year 17,000 students appealed, 3,000 of whom were upgraded and 600 offers were made. As a consequence of that, all but three of those received offers within that timeframe, or within last year’s academic year. We are going to move might and main, and I know that the Minister with responsibility for higher education has said likewise, to ensure those students will be in a position to receive those offers this year, within this academic year. We will do that to the absolute best of our ability. I appreciate some students have already taken up offers, as may have occurred in previous years as well. It is important to note that as a special arrangement this year, any student who receives a higher offer, either as a result of taking the exams in November or as a result of an upgrade, will not have to pay any fees, registration or otherwise, and will of course be eligible for SUSI again. It is not an ideal situation which I absolutely know to be the case. I would never have wanted students to be in this position. All of us have an agreed agenda here which is that we only want what is best for the students. They are at the centre of all that we do in the Department of Education and Skills. I have worked all my life in the education sector and I want to ensure, through working with people like the Deputy and the Members of Dáil Éireann, that we deliver for the students. This is not an ideal situation and I regret it.	spk_401
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	On Polymetrika, as the Deputy is aware and as I said earlier, the decision was taken in April to postpone the leaving certificate examinations until July, followed rather quickly on 8 May by the decision by the then Minister to move towards calculated grades. Prior to that, contingency planning was being undertaken as to what might happen if the Minister had to make the decision at that time.It is important to point out, in reference to previous points the Deputy made about the difficulties and issues around calculated grades, that calculated grades were introduced by the Minister on 8 May but they were first mooted by students and, further to engagement with representative bodies such as teachers, principals, deputy principals, managerial bodies, parents and student representatives, it was an agreed process to move forward with calculated grades. It is important to acknowledge that this was the best view at the time given that we were living in an extraordinarily difficult time. The decision was made to ensure the students, the class of 2020, would have a pathway to move forward in terms of further or higher education or whatever other pathway they would want to choose. In the interests of balance it is very important to mention that. Polymetrika and its principal, Fernando Cartwright, are experts in a highly technical and specialised field in the area of statistics, psychometrics and educational testing. Polymetrika had worked in Ireland previously and its expertise in statistics and psychometrics is especially in the high stakes fields. Having initially been engaged in an advisory capacity with the technical working group prior to April or May and as part of the contingency planning for the 2020 leaving certificate, it was then engaged to implement and deliver the system when the decision was taken on 8 May to postpone the leaving certificate.	spk_425
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	It is my understanding that the then Minister signed off on the calculated grades process on 8 May. The exact time and date of the signing of a contract with Polymetrika is not available to me at this point in time. The Deputy will appreciate that it was some considerable time ago but I will make every effort to furnish that to him should he require it. I will ask my Department to do that. In respect of the aspects he has raised, I am not a statistician or an expert in any aspect of psychometrics but the Deputy mentioned the notion of oversight, quality, validation and so on. In terms of oversight, a series of mechanisms were put in place comprising the national standardisation group; the independent steering committee chaired by Dr. Áine Lawlor, formerly of the Teaching Council; the international external reviewer, Dr. Janet Brown of the Scottish Qualifications Authority; and the Educational and Research Centre, which was running a parallel system. Through that system, validations and checks, etc., were taking place. All of that was put in place and documentation relating to this has been made available on the website. If there is further specific information the Deputy requires, I will ensure my officials make it available to him.	spk_427
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	As I said previously, it is difficult to know the finite number of students until all the checks, reviews and balances have been put in place. In terms of the students the Deputy has referenced who will go up by at least one grade, we estimate at this point that we are talking about approximately 6,500. That is an estimate at this stage. I can only estimate that, when students' grades go up, we are perhaps talking about a similar number but, again, I am not a statistician and I would not have that information fully available to the Deputy until the review is completed.	spk_429
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	I cannot say that definitively but I am going to assume that if the estimate is that that number will go up by one grade, there is every chance that we might be talking about a similar number. When the absolute figures become available they will be made available to the Deputy, the general public and, most importantly, to the students.	spk_431
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	To clarify, if a student received a higher grade than was their due, that student retains that grade. We have been very clear that no student will be downgraded. Equally, it is an established practice that where a student is awarded a higher grade as a consequence of an error through no fault of their own, and this would have happened in previous years, they retain that grade. That would be the position now and I think that is only fair.	spk_433
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	I absolutely confirm to the Deputy that there are students who have benefited and whose grades have increased. I reiterate that those students will retain those grades. No student will be downgraded. I can only speak in the absolute here. That is an established practice and it is what I can confirm for the Deputy.	spk_435
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	In the absolute I know that students have been upgraded. In the absolute I can tell the Deputy that no student will be downgraded and in the absolute I can say to him that it is an established practice.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	On the issue of checks, validation and oversight, I must confirm again that there was a series of layers of such oversight. I referred already to the national standardisation group, the independent steering committee, the international expert reviewer and the Education Research Centre. The Education Research Centre sampled aspects of the code. There was the initial code. Then those concerned were running what I have been informed was a process in parallel to the system being operated by the contractor. Therefore, there were checks and balances put in place. I absolutely accept that it is beyond unfortunate that errors arose. Those errors were found internally, and when they were found, immediate and proactive action was taken. That is important also.	spk_443
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	It is important to clarify that when an error was identified, it was identified internally within the system.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	I thank the Deputy. The error identified by Polymetrika on Tuesday evening of last week was identified as the company was working through the leaving certificate applied results, which are based on a two-year programme. These results are generally uploaded after the leaving certificate results become available. The fifth-year results from the subject area were being worked on. At that point, as I said, Polymetrika identified what it classed at that early stage as an anomaly. In other words, it became apparent that there was something not correct. As regards what that was or meant, there was no clarity at that early stage. The calculated grades office was informed. The system ran through the night and the following day work ensued, as I have outlined. The Deputy asked about the contract and payment. To the best of my knowledge, the original contract was around the €170,000 mark. I will check that and revert to the Deputy. For absolute clarity, I just want to check that. What was the Deputy's third question?	spk_455
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	There was, of course, a contract. Obviously, as with any contract, there are penalties. All that will obviously be pursued to the absolute extent.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	There was oversight of the process from the very beginning. That included oversight by the national standardisation group and the independent steering committee, which was important and which was chaired by Dr. Áine Lawlor, formerly of the Teaching Council. Equally, an international external review was conducted by Dr. Janet Brown, formerly of the Scottish Qualifications Authority. There was a further external review here by the Education Research Centre. There was validation and there were checks and balances. A number of layers were put in place. As I said previously, all the information and data concerning each of these groups have been made available and are available online. The reports they have produced and opinions they have offered are also available.	spk_459

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	I thank the Deputy for raising that point. I acknowledge that he is 100% correct that this is an incredibly sensitive and anxious time for the students. At no stage do I want to diminish the anxiety that students are experiencing. I would go beyond that because I know that it is not just the student but the entire family who are drawn into this. I appreciate that all households become involved when a student is taking the leaving certificate examination or any examination. I acknowledge the anxiety that exists. As the Deputy has acknowledged, I have apologised previously and I will continue to apologise for the stress and anxiety that has been placed on students. On the text message, it was transmitted yesterday to students so that they would be made aware of exactly what was happening. I reiterate that students are the central and principal concern in all of this. I want to abide by that throughout this process. On the specific instance raised by the Deputy of the transmission of an incorrect link, I am not aware of that. I am aware of the text message being sent to the approximately 61,000 students. The issue of an incorrect link has not been raised with me. If that is the case, I am sorry to hear that. I will investigate that with my officials and revert to the Deputy on the matter. I again thank him for raising the issue.	spk_465

The CAO will make higher preference offers to those who are deserving of them at that point. We will move to do that as quickly as possible because I appreciate that it is important students receive those offers as quickly as possible. I mentioned previously that students who receive an upgrade as a special arrangement this year, either as a consequence of the calculated grade or of taking the examination in November, will not have to pay any fees, registration or otherwise, and they will be eligible for the SUSI grant. On the number of places, I confirm and acknowledge the preparedness of the Minister with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Harris, and his Department to work with the Department of Education, the CAO and the Higher Education Authority to do all that is within our gift to ensure that the maximum number of students receive their offer and placement this year. That is the objective. It is important to reiterate that last year there were 17,000 appeals, of which 3,000 were successful and 600 students were upgraded and became eligible to receive higher preference offers. All of the 600, bar three, received their offer within the academic year last year. It is my absolute objective, in co-operation with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to ensure that, if at all possible, similar success will be achieved this year.	spk_467
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	In regard to the Deputy's confusion as to the reason the leaving certificate applied aspect was involved, he will appreciate the leaving certificate applied is a two-year programme and the fifth year aspect of it was being uploaded. That is why that was happening at that time. The Deputy is correct that it was at that time the error was identified. In terms of the processes, oversight and so on, I have said previously, and I say so honestly again, I am not a statistician. I am not an expert in psychometrics or examination testing. Therefore, I can only give the Deputy the layman's version as I understand it. My understanding, without any expertise in this area, is that there was oversight of the process by the national standardisation group, the independent steering committee and the international external reviewer and, most important, the Education Research Centre was running the data in parallel with the process being run by the contractor. That is my understanding of what has happening at the time. An error occurred and it was identified. Something went wrong. We are in this position now because something went wrong. I accept that. I have acknowledged that and once the error became known, positive and proactive action was taken.	spk_477
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-10-01	dail	33	Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_28	I guarantee that I will work with the Minister, Deputy Harris, as I said earlier. I acknowledge his and his Department's co-operation in working through the current situation. Every effort we can make will be made to ensure that students who are offered a higher preference place will receive it within this academic year. There is an absolute determination to do that. My opening remarks gave me the opportunity to acknowledge the errors that have occurred in the calculated grades system and, importantly, to apologise for the impact these errors are having. I appreciate having the opportunity to do that once again. I have listened to the concerns of Deputies and also to the comments and questions from those with whom I met remotely yesterday afternoon. The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, are committed to ensuring that we support students in addressing the challenges that lie ahead and when the revised offers are made through the CAO. It is important to remember, with regard to the CAO and what happens every year, that following the examinations appeals process some appeals are successful and students receive revised CAO offers. In essence, that is the same sequence we propose to follow this year. The scale is considerably bigger and that is a challenge. Almost half of those who received calculated grades received their first preference choice as a CAO offer and 80% received one of their first three choices. Some of these students will receive revised grades. As regards those who receive revised grades, it is not limited to any single group of students or to a particular subject area. There will be revised grades across all subjects and students. I appreciate the earnestness and sincerity of all Deputies who have engaged in the discussion tonight, of those who engaged earlier with me and of those who engage on an ongoing basis with positive and constructive contributions for the sake of education, to which we are all greatly committed. I appreciate the wisdom, experience and, indeed, the genuine nature of the contributions Members make in the House on all that happens in the education sector. Creating and building the calculated grades process and supporting systems was a major logistical undertaking. That has been a much-used phrase over the last while but, even so, that does not take from its veracity. The calculated grades process was a direct response to challenges presented by Covid-19 and it was designed and implemented in a very short timeframe. Undoubtedly, it was done in good faith by the Minister at the time when he made the announcement on 8 May last. My focus now is on ensuring the work being undertaken by my Department, Polymetrika International and the external reviewer can be concluded as quickly as possible. I want students to appreciate that all that must be done will be done to ensure that the maximum number of students who are entitled to a higher preference offer will receive those offers. I conclude by apologising again to the students of 2020 and acknowledging the impact the two errors have had on them. We are working to resolve the situation. I appreciate the resilience, forbearance and patience students have shown to this point. I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to be here this evening.	spk_480
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-09-17	dail	33	Road Projects	dbsect_27	"I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and allowing me to address it. The provision of calculated grades to students arose in the unprecedented circumstances of our not being able to run a leaving certificate examination, as the Deputies will all be aware. The concept was first mooted by students and there was an extensive process of engagement with education stakeholders and an agreement to proceed with the calculated grades process. Under the model, estimated marks from schools were adjusted, using a carefully developed standardisation model to ensure a consistent standard was applied across schools across the country, when judging the performance of students. Standardisation takes place every year in marking the leaving certificate examinations. That is an extremely important point. While teachers are familiar with their own students, they cannot be expected to have knowledge of the standards nationwide. Standardisation allows student-to-student comparability across the country. As Deputies may be aware, at the start of September I brought to the Cabinet a proposal to remove school-by-school historical subject level data from the national standardisation process used to determine calculated grades. This decision meant that no student's calculated grade was impacted by the historical performance of the school he or she attended. The statistical procedure has been subject to a high degree of oversight by the national standardisation group which was established to oversee the work. Its implementation has also been independently overseen by an independent steering committee, chaired by Dr. Áine Lawlor, former director of the Teaching Council. All the information regarding the process and its oversight is fully transparent and it is available online at  As Deputies will know, as part of the process, schools provided the Department with an estimated percentage mark and rank order for each student. Following the standardisation process, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and, subsequently, to a calculated grade. This was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade. It is not accurate to state students were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process; rather, the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 leaving certificate calculated grades. The system of calculated grades allowed the Department to provide results to over 60,000 students, many of whom have now received CAO round one offers. Some 80% of CAO applicants received a CAO offer from their top three preferences. Of all grades awarded, 83.1% were either the same or higher than the grade that school estimated percentage marks would have awarded, while 16.9% were lower. The increase of 4.4 percentage points in the average marks across all subjects and at all levels this year is present across all types of schools. It was inevitable, however, that some students would have their estimated marks adjusted downwards as part of standardisation. The overall data from school estimated marks show there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally in examinations. Without standardisation in some subjects, the number of H1s awarded would have been two to three times higher. This would not have been tenable and would have presented considerable difficulties for higher and further education. While some students had a lower percentage mark awarded following standardisation, it is possible that many of the concerns being raised are based on what marks schools estimated for their students this year rather than on the results attained in examinations across previous years. I believe this is the point made by the Deputies. The standardisation process was applied to all schools in the same way, irrespective of whether the school was in the State system or was fee charging. With regard to schools outside the State system, data analysis in the report of the national standardisation group shows that schools in the non-recognised category, which is made up largely of institutions often referred to as ""grind schools"", overestimated their student marks to a greater extent than in recognised schools.Furthermore, when comparing the results of students in fee-charging schools in the State sector and in the private non-recognised schools institutes versus those in non-fee-charging schools, those in fee-charging schools and institutions still have higher scores than students in non-fee-charging schools even after standardisation. Students who are disappointed with one or more of their calculated grades had the opportunity to submit an appeal. The appeals process closed yesterday, Wednesday, 16 September at 5 p.m. The appeals process is a review focused on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process."	spk_257
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-09-17	dail	33	Road Projects	dbsect_27	I reiterate that the development of the model for calculated grades has been a challenging process and would not have been possible without the co-operation of teachers and schools. I absolutely acknowledge that. For students who are disappointed with their results, the opportunity to avail of the appeals mechanism to ensure there were no administrative errors in processing their results was, as I have already outlined, provided to them. I appreciate that in every examination system and in every leaving certificate system, as we are aware, there are students who will be happy and students who will be disappointed. I absolutely want to acknowledge that. I also acknowledge that it has an impact on entire households in circumstances of that nature. I am aware and cognisant of that.  I also reiterate that students have opportunities at the postponed examinations in November. I believe this is an important avenue open to students should they wish to available of it. It is important to point out that this year, the CAO was able to make 78,950 first round offers last Friday. That is 6% higher than in 2019. Overall, CAO applications were up only 0.6% as a result of additional places being made available by the Government. This means many more students will have received a CAO offer. Some 52% of students received an offer for their first preference course while 80%, as I said previously, received an offer for a top three preference. Again, given that we are in the midst of a pandemic and given the extraordinary circumstance in which we find ourselves, it is an extraordinarily positive reflection that so many students were in a position to avail of those offers. Inevitably, there will be students and parents who remain dissatisfied with the outcome of the calculated grades and the CAO process. Every year, students miss out on CAO places as more students seek places than there are actually places available. I would, however, encourage those students to explore the options available to them to achieve their goals and ambitions and I wish them well. I recognise that it can be a difficult time for everybody involved. It was, however, an extraordinary circumstance that meant we had to introduce an extraordinary measure and that was the agreed measure of calculation grades.	spk_260

On 17 December 2019 it was announced that the patronage of the new post-primary school for Greystones-Kilcoole was awarded to Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB. It had been the intention to open the community college in the newly constructed community national school building in September 2020 but this has not proved possible. Greystones community college opened its doors to 64 first year students on Friday, 28 August 2020 in Greystones Lawn Tennis Club. The school, KWETB and my Department are grateful to Greystones Lawn Tennis Club for facilitating Greystones community college. I acknowledge the efforts of the entire school community in preparing the accommodation for the school's opening in these particularly difficult circumstances. As the Deputy will be aware, the building project to deliver a new 1,000-pupil school for Greystones community college is planned for the designated post-primary site at Charlesland. My Department is committed to delivering this site for the new post-primary school for the Greystones and Kilcoole area of County Wicklow and work is ongoing to achieve this as soon as possible. Discussions are ongoing with the landowner with a view to acquiring this site. As the Deputy will appreciate, any site acquisition process can be lengthy and there can be complex issues which need to be addressed during negotiations, technical assessments and conveyancing. At all times, my Department must strive to obtain best value for the Exchequer while seeking to complete the acquisition as quickly and efficiently as possible. The project to deliver the permanent accommodation for the school is to be delivered under the Department's design and build programme. As soon as there is sufficient certainty in respect of completion of the site acquisition, the architectural planning and design stage will be completed and, following grant of planning permission, the project will be expedited to tender and construction stages. I am aware of the issues the Deputy has outlined regarding the current accommodation. I again acknowledge the work that went into making that accommodation available. She will be aware of the difficulties with the proposed accommodation that was being made available. My Department is in ongoing discussions with the contractor on that and it will be expedited as quickly as possible.	spk_262
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-09-17	dail	33	Road Projects	dbsect_27	As the Deputy will be aware, construction of Greystones community national school commenced on site in September 2018, prior to the emergence of issues in October 2018 in 42 schools constructed by the contractor involved, which has been the focus of the Department's schools remediation programme. For the duration of the work, the Department's project management technical advisory team included an architect, civil and structural engineer, fire consultant and others. These parties carried out regular site visits and inspections for the duration of the works. Matters raised by the contractor were tracked on an ongoing basis through fortnightly site visits and inspections by the project team to ensure the identified items were closed out. The Department also retained a full-time on-site clerk of works for the duration of the project. Throughout the construction period the Department's project management team have used the appropriate provisions of the public work contract to secure the necessary assurance that the building is fit for handover prior to accepting it for handover. The Department will only accept the building and make it available for occupation by the school when it is completely satisfied that it is fit for handover prior to accepting it. The Department is taking appropriate steps to ensure this and engagement is under way between the Department and the contractor in this regard under contract. It is too early to say how long this engagement process might take but, as the process develops, my departmental officials will keep the ETB and school management informed of developments. I think it would only be appropriate to consider having a meeting further to that information becoming available to me.	spk_264

Before I address the specific issue raised, I would like to provide the House with an outline of the extent of the school transport service.  School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann, as the Deputy has noted, on behalf of the Department. In the 2019-20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million km at a cost of over €219 million in 2019.  The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the scheme, children are eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria, which are 3.2 km at primary level and 4.8 km at post-primary level, and are attending their nearest school as determined by my Department-Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language. All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time for the 2020-21 school year have been accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated. Such seats are referred to, as the Deputy has previously stated, as concessionary seats. The provision of a seat on a concessionary basis in a given year does not confer any continuing entitlement for that user in following years as concessionary places are entirely contingent on there being spare seats once eligible users are provided for.  To date for the 2020-21 school year, Bus Éireann has issued or allocated tickets to over 97,000 children on the primary and post-primary school transport schemes, including tickets for over 26,200 concessionary applicants. The closing date for payment for the 2020-21 school year was Tuesday, 4 August 2020. The school transport scheme family portal was temporarily closed for applications and payments on 20 August 2020. This temporary closure was necessary to complete the work required to issue tickets to families who at that time remained due to be allocated a ticket for school transport services for the 2020-21 school year. The school transport scheme family portal has now re-opened. However, parents or guardians making an application or payment at this time for the 2020-21 year are reminded that while it is possible to submit a payment, payments made at this time are now considered late. Late applicants or families who pay late or both, both eligible and concessionary, are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2020-21 school year.  In addition, applications and payments for post-primary seats completed or made after 4 August 2020 will be only considered when the 50% capacity required by new Covid-19 public health guidelines is achieved on each route. The timeframe for this will vary from route to route and may take a number of weeks to complete.  In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.  With regard to the review of the school transport scheme, as announced by my predecessor in October 2019, given the current evolving situation with Covid-19, the proposed review has been delayed.However, I propose to convene the steering group in the short term and to agree and supplement revised terms of reference to reflect the programme for Government, including an examination of issues such as the nearest or next nearest school. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for affording me the opportunity to provide an outline of the extent of the school transport scheme and to respond.	spk_310

In the first instance, as I previously outlined, all those who were eligible and had paid on time were given their tickets. Where there was extra capacity, concessionary tickets were made available. We are now doing a review of bus routes to meet the new guidelines issued by NPHET just one week in advance of the return to school so as to reach the 50% capacity. Where there is additional capacity after that, the concessionary tickets will be made available to those who have paid on time.

In addition, applications and payments for post-primary seats completed or made after 4 August 2020 will be only considered when the 50% capacity required by new Covid-19 public health guidelines is achieved on each route. The timeframe for this will vary from route to route and may take a number of weeks to complete.  In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.  With regard to the review of the school transport scheme, as announced by my predecessor in October 2019, given the current evolving situation with Covid-19, the proposed review has been delayed.However, I propose to convene the steering group in the short term and to agree and supplement revised terms of reference to reflect the programme for Government, including an examination of issues such as the nearest or next nearest school. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for affording me the opportunity to provide an outline of the extent of the school transport scheme and to respond.	spk_310

In the first instance, as I previously outlined, all those who were eligible and had paid on time were given their tickets. Where there was extra capacity, concessionary tickets were made available. We are now doing a review of bus routes to meet the new guidelines issued by NPHET just one week in advance of the return to school so as to reach the 50% capacity. Where there is additional capacity after that, the concessionary tickets will be made available to those who have paid on time.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-09-03	dail	33	Back to School, Further and Higher Education and Special Education: Statements	dbsect_27	"I last spoke in this House immediately before it went in to recess. At that time I had just published the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. That was only five weeks ago and much has happened since then. An incredible amount of work has been undertaken in the school sector. As a country dealing with the challenges of Covid-19, we are in a different place now than then, but just as the publication of the roadmap represented an important milestone on the road back towards the ""old normal"", I concede that there are many miles left on the road to normality. I was at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response yesterday and we covered a range of the issues of concern to school communities across the country as well as to me as Minister and to Deputies. It is a measure of the importance of education generally and indeed the education sector in this country that the Oireachtas has scheduled a significant amount of its time this week for education matters. This level of engagement with the Oireachtas has been a feature since the closure of the education sector in March and it ensures that we keep a light on the work being undertaken and the concerns that arise. As Deputies know, the reopening of our schools was since my appointment, and continues to be, my number one priority. It was not a hope as some would have characterised it when we were last in this House. It was very much a realisable ambition which like all ambitions presented a series of challenges for us to address in order to realise it. I have been fully supported by Government in putting in place the supports necessary to realise this ambition and in recent days and this week we have seen that ambition being realised. Government has been united in viewing the reopening of schools as a national priority. I am very much encouraged by that cross-Government support and I wish to express my sincere thanks to all concerned. Cabinet approved the Roadmap for the Full Return to School in July. It sets out how the public health advice provided to my Department on the safe return to school could be implemented at individual school level. Approval was given for over €375 million in additional funding necessary to support its implementation. I provided details of the supports being made available to both Houses of the Oireachtas during that last week of July and the effect of those supports has been seen across the country as schools reopened their doors from last week. During August, I provided a number of updates on how the planning for schools reopening was progressing. To date, the payments made directly to schools exceed €160 million. My Department brought forward the payment of the annual minor works grant to primary schools, totalling approximately €30 million, which is typically paid in either December or January each year. In addition, an enhanced minor works grant, which matches the 2019 payment, has also been issued directly to schools. This amounts to €60 million which has now been issued directly to primary schools in minor works grants since the publication of the roadmap. A minor works grant amounting to €42 million issued to post-primary schools in the free scheme. The minor works grant provides schools with the necessary flexibility to implement necessary physical measures in their school quickly to enable the full return to school. These measures include, but are not limited to, reconfiguration of classroom space, repurposing rooms to provide additional space, purchasing furniture, altering desk layouts and the short-term rental of additional space. Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide on the appropriate reconfiguration measures for their school which are necessary to facilitate school reopening. Further, more than €30 million of capitation supports has been made available to primary and post-primary schools to fund personal protective equipment and hand sanitiser requirements. The roadmap was developed following intensive engagement with partners in education, including staff unions, representatives of principals and deputy principals, school management bodies and representatives of parents and post-primary students. This co-operation and collaboration has continued, including at a local level where school communities have worked together to best address their local circumstances. On Tuesday, officials met with the primary and post-primary stakeholders again to maintain that spirit of partnership regarding school reopening. There was also a meeting of the advisory group on the State examinations earlier this week, emphasising the continued co-operation in that area. There are daily engagements with partners in education and these will continue. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the unstinting and selfless efforts of school communities across the country over the last weeks and months to do all that is necessary to reopen our schools. We owe a debt of gratitude to all of them for their generosity of spirit, a reflection of their absolute dedication to their students and the provision of education for all. The roadmap and its accompanying documentation provided schools with guidance on training, checklists for schools on preparing for reopening and guidance for operating the school safely in a Covid-19 context. Template Covid-19 response plans for schools were also provided to schools. These plans provide clear and practical guidance and support to schools on the range of measures that need to be put in place to bring everyone back to school safely. The Department has produced age-appropriate guidance for students in the form of animated videos which are intended to help students further understand some of the new routines when they return to school. Guidance is also available for parents in several languages. These animations are available at  The HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre has confirmed that all recommendations in the public health advice I published at the beginning of July including physical distancing guidelines as set out in the roadmap still apply in all schools, with the exception of the recommendations on face coverings, which have been updated to reflect the latest research and expertise. Teachers and post-primary school students should wear face coverings similar to those worn in shops or on public transport when a physical distance of 2 m cannot be maintained. Guidance for parents, guardians and families on the return to school is available online at  A letter was issued to all schools last week, together with a HSE document titled, Schools Pathway for COVID-19, the Public Health Approach. This document sets out the approach to managing isolated confirmed cases of Covid-19 within the school community and also the principles that will underpin the management of outbreaks or potential outbreaks and the aligned testing strategy within an educational facility. It is important to note that the response to confirmed cases or outbreaks of Covid-19 in the community or in a school is the responsibility of, and will be led and managed by, the HSE's public health department. All decisions as to appropriate actions following a confirmed case or outbreak will be made by their teams in the context of a full public health risk assessment procedure according to the principles set out in the document. Any actions to be taken by the school will be communicated directly by the HSE's public health department.School management will be informed as and when actions such as the exclusion of children or staff, or partial or full closure, are deemed necessary on public health grounds. Children will continue to display symptoms of many other circulating respiratory viruses. It is known that young children often have a persistent cold. According to HSE guidelines a child with a blocked or runny nose but no fever can attend school, but if they require paracetamol or ibuprofen they must stay at home for 48 hours and parents or guardians should contact the GP to assess whether a test is required. Students and staff who have symptoms of Covid-19, including fever, new cough, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, or loss or change to their sense of smell or taste, should not attend school. The definition of close contacts within a school will be variable and determined by a risk assessment that will take account of individual factors within each school or class. It will not be automatically assumed that a whole class will be deemed as close contacts. Close contacts will be directly notified by the HSE and advised to restrict their movements and present for testing on day zero and day seven. Close contacts will restrict their movements for 14 days even in the event that Covid-19 is not detected in both of these tests. There is no blanket policy to test entire classes or years. The testing strategy will be aligned to the public health risk assessment, which may recommend widespread swabbing within a class or school under HSE testing procedures. In the event of an outbreak, public health will determine between a range of possible interventions, from exclusion and testing of a small group or pod of pupils up to and including closure of an affected facility. All schools are required to have a summary of key information to assist public health in its public health risk assessment, ready to be provided on request. Outside the school environment, everyone should follow the latest public health measures announced on 18 August, which are available on  I have heard the concerns raised in regard to class sizes in our schools and in our primary schools in particular. It is important to note that we have seen what is commonly referred to as the pupil-teacher ratio reduce in recent years. The staffing schedule has undergone a number of changes in the period since 2014. These changes include the general average pupil number per teacher being reduced from 28:1 to 26:1; the introduction of retention for small schools in 2015; and the changing of retention thresholds for Gaeltacht schools. The current programme for Government commits to making further progress during the term of this Government on the staffing schedule. I know that school transport is an area of considerable interest to Deputies. It came up during the Covid-19 committee sessions yesterday. It was perhaps the issue on which we spent most time yesterday. The school transport scheme is a massive daily logistical undertaking right across the country and it is worth repeating the numbers involved. In 2019, more than 120,000 children, including some 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in more than 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering more than 100 million km at a cost of €219 million. Several Deputies at yesterday's Covid committee hearing raised the area of funding for the operation of the hygiene requirements on school transport vehicles. A sum of €11.3 million has been allocated for this purpose. This cost estimate was based on cost per vehicle, based on the number of vehicles on the scheme, and includes a contribution towards the cost of personal protective equipment, PPE, for drivers, enhanced cleaning and sanitising materials and labour, with an estimated cost of €6.1 million for the period from September to December 2020. For the period from January to June 2021, an estimated €5.2 million will be required for cleaning materials, labour and PPE. The provision includes ongoing monitoring of any additional expenditure for enhanced cleaning requirements or PPE to ensure continued compliance with safety requirements in line with public health advice. Under the terms of the arrangement my Department has with Bus Éireann, it is funded on a cost recovery basis for costs associated with the operation of the school transport scheme. Therefore, as costs are incurred as a result of the additional hygiene and PPE requirements, they will be included in the bill to the Department for the relevant period. The Department has not given the sanctioned €11.3 million over to Bus Éireann. The costs as they arise will be charged to the Department by Bus Éireann as they are incurred. The recently received updated health advice from NPHET does impact on the operation of post-primary school transport services. The Government decided that the arrangements made for the primary school transport scheme would proceed as planned when schools reopened. These services are operating fully with additional measures in place, such as preassigned seating and additional hygiene and cleaning measures as already outlined. The post-primary scheme has also commenced operation with additional measures in place, such as preassigned seating and additional hygiene and cleaning measures on services, and with the rolling implementation of measures to provide physical distancing in line with those required on public transport, and which is using 50% of passenger capacity on the post-primary services as required. My Department is engaging with Bus Éireann in respect of these plans to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so. Over the coming period, all other post-primary transport services will be reorganised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing. Bus Éireann has returned to the market seeking additional operators to provide services. I expect to see additional capacity coming on stream over the coming weeks and we are committed to ensuring the public health advice is given effect in the operation of school transport. Deputies will also be aware of my recent announcement which provided for the parents of children who are eligible for transport, but decide not to avail of post-primary transport services, to receive a grant to support them with the cost of private transport arrangements within defined parameters. Deputies will also be aware of the announcement I made this week on calculated grades, which followed a Government decision on proposals I put forward to amend the national standardisation process within the calculated grades model. Under the calculated grades model, estimated marks from schools will be adjusted, as planned, to ensure a consistent standard is applied across schools throughout the country when judging the performance of students. The change I introduced removes the use of school-by-school historical data in the standardisation model and places a greater emphasis on the estimated marks provided by schools to individual students. Fairness has always been at the heart of the calculated grades model. The calculated grades process is being used for the first time. Standardisation will ensure the candidates receiving calculated grades in 2020 are treated fairly and equitably relative to each other."	spk_117
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-09-03	dail	33	Back to School, Further and Higher Education and Special Education: Statements	dbsect_27	I apologise. I thought I had 20 minutes.	spk_119
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	The purpose of the calculated grades system is to arrive at the grade each student would have achieved if the leaving certificate examinations had taken place as normal. Students' expected performance in a subject and level is combined with information about how students in a school have fared in the subject in recent years in line with national performance standards over time and with their performance in the junior certificate. Using a range of different but complementary sources of data will provide the most accurate and fair set of results possible. No single pattern of expected results will determine the calculated grades on its own. The model will combine the range of patterns to generate the grades in a way which is as reasonable, fair and accurate to students as possible. The design of the calculated grades model was informed by advice from a technical working group comprising experts drawn from the State Examinations Commission, the inspectorate of my Department, the Educational Research Centre and international external experts. While these data sets do include certain demographic information, this demographic information is not being used as part of the process of generating the calculated grades through the standardisation process. However, to make sure that the standardisation process is doing what it is supposed to do, a separate and additional process of validation is being carried out. Validation serves to ensure that the statistical standardisation process presents results that are fair, equitable and in line with previous outcomes to the greatest extent possible. It also serves to check whether the model is resulting in any particular group being advantaged or disadvantaged relative to previous years. The use of demographic characteristics, including gender and the socioeconomic status of the school, was inherent in the technical working group's design of the calculated grades model. Not to run these checks would run the risk of not being able to tell whether the standardisation process is working to ensure that the leaving certificate results of 2020 are properly comparable with leaving certificate results in any other year. My Department has published a short guide to data collection, national standardisation and quality assurance which provides further details about the workings of the calculated grades model. This is available online.	spk_21
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	I thank the Deputy. I must reiterate that all possible checks and balances have been put in place to ensure that the calculated grades model is a fair and equitable system. The 2020 leaving certificate will have the same high quality and integrity as the 2019 leaving certificate and indeed that of 2021 and other future years. While these data sets include certain demographic information, it is not being used as part of the process of generating the calculated grades through the standardisation process. However, to make sure that the standardisation process is doing what it is supposed to do, a completely separate process, referred to as validation, is being carried out.	spk_23

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	As the Deputy is aware, yesterday I announced the roadmap for the full return to school, along with more than €370 million in funding to support primary and post-primary schools as they prepare for reopening. It is recognised that in preparing for full reopening schools may require some reconfiguration works to ensure that all available space, including class space, is used to maximise physical distancing safely. Adaption works may include, but are not limited to, reconfiguration of classroom space, repurposing rooms to provide additional space, adapting storage facilities, purchasing furniture, altering desk layouts and adapting toilet areas. As each school setting is different, a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate. Individual schools are best placed to decide on the appropriate reconfiguration works. As part of the package of supports, additional teachers are being provided to support the reopening of primary schools in order to provide enhanced substitution and eliminate the need to mix classes when a teacher is absent. Supply panels are being established nationwide. These will be monitored in terms of the number of teachers and the location of each panel. Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils, which is at its historically lowest level. In terms of operating in this school year, schools will be required to look at maximising all available physical space, particularly to accommodate larger classes. Examples of class layouts have been provided to support schools. The minor works grant is being provided to assist schools if they need to reconfigure classrooms or undertake other work. Schools will also be required to look at how classes are organised in terms of sizes, and this may require some reorganisation of class groupings. My Department absolutely will work with any school that needs extra support when other options are not feasible, and this may involve additional teachers or extra accommodation in some cases.	spk_28
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	Again, I confirm that substantial resources are going into schools to facilitate schools doing what needs to be done on the ground. I include in that, as we have already outlined, the €75 million that has been made available through the minor works grant. That funding is significant and substantial. In the first instance, it is a doubling of the minor works grant funding to primary schools and it is a similar but new strand of funding for second-level schools. There is great potential for schools to reconfigure and re-examine. For example, there are opportunities to declutter within the classroom. There are opportunities to look at additional space within the campus of the school and to look outside of that, where necessary. I accept that where there are exceptional cases all schools are invited to engage with the Department. There is a helpline for schools to allow them to flag individual needs within their schools. The resources and the supports are available. Everything that needs to be done will be done to ensure that schools can maximise their space and that there is every opportunity and expectation, which I know can be realised, that there will be a full and safe reopening of schools at the end of August or in early September.	spk_30
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	On that point, prior to 2016, teachers were allocated to primary schools at a general average of one teacher for every 28 pupils, but budget 2016 improved that ratio by one point to 27:1. Budget 2018 provided for a further point improvement to the staffing schedule so that teachers are allocated on a general average of one teacher for every 26 pupils, with effect since September 2018. This is the lowest pupil-teacher ratio ever at primary school. I am very conscious of the staffing schedule and the need to prioritise teacher allocations in primary schools given their vital role in communities across the country. I am looking at how best to make further progress in reducing the primary school teacher-pupil ratio in the context of the programme for Government implementation. I will continue to look at that in the context of the budget as we move forward.	spk_32
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	As the Deputy is aware, on Monday the Government published Roadmap for the Full Return to School, along with details of a financial package of over €375 million to support the implementation of the measures in the roadmap, following approval by the Government. The range of supports being made available to schools includes additional financial supports to provide for additional staffing, management supports, enhanced cleaning, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment, PPE, costs under the Covid-19 response plans. A Covid-19-specific capitation payment will be used as the mechanism to support the implementation of enhanced cleaning regimes in schools, with close to an additional €53 million for this purpose.  This will be provided on a sliding scale in line with pupil enrolments as at 30 September 2019, with €63 per mainstream pupil at primary level and €40 per pupil and post-primary level. Arrangements have also been made for a drawdown framework to be established to enable schools to purchase hand sanitisers and other PPE supplies for use in the school and classroom from pre-approved suppliers. The procurement process for this framework has already commenced, and it is intended that these materials will be available in early August. The funding for these materials will be provided in the form of a grant which will issue in instalments, the first of which will issue from mid-August to cover the period to December 2020. Enhanced Covid-19 rates are payable in respect of students attending special schools and special classes attached to mainstream schools to assist with the extra costs associated with the cleaning of classrooms operating in specialist provision.	spk_34
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	I thank the Deputy for raising that important point. I appreciate the pressures on schools and parents. Every effort is being made to ensure substantial funding is put in place to ensure no additional burden is placed on the school or on parents. There is a budget of €53 million for cleaning and all that involves, which is a substantial package of funding. We have also put in place further aid to ensure schools will be in a position to employ extra personnel in the month of August to help them to do the work that needs to be done on the ground. A further €4.3 million is being made available for that. It is a substantial resource and I have every confidence it will be well drawn down and well utilised by the schools.	spk_36
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	I would not accept that assertion at all. The roadmap is inclusive of all schools whether urban or rural. I come from a constituency that marries both so I am greatly conscious that the packages are made available on an urban and rural basis. A key innovation, perhaps more to the benefit of rural schools is the additional one day which will be given to teaching principals which is something of which they are richly deserving, and takes cognisance of the burden placed on them by the administrative work they need to do. A suite of measures has been put in place to the benefit of both urban and rural schools and for the benefit, most especially, of the children and young people that we serve in the education sector, irrespective of whether they are urban or rural.	spk_38
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills. In the 2019-2020 school year more than 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million km at a cost of over €219 million in 2019. Earlier this week I announced a comprehensive plan detailing a package of measures and resources to be provided to facilitate schools in reopening. I also published a detailed roadmap for the full return to school. This roadmap set outs how schools will reopen for all students from the end of August. It has been developed in line with public health advice issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, the Roadmap for Society and Business, and follows comprehensive and intensive engagement with all relevant stakeholders, including Bus Éireann, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority on the logistical considerations that arise in planning for the operation of school transport services for the reopening of our schools. School transport scheme services operated by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department will fully operate as normal, in line with public health advice, when schools reopen for the 2020-2021 school year with the appropriate hygiene and other measures in place. In line with normal practice, all children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who complete the application and payment process on time, will be considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated, such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. All school transport services are reviewed over the summer months. Arising from this, routes may be altered, extended or withdrawn depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year.  The option to make payment for transport for the 2020-2021 school year is now available. Given the exceptional circumstances I have asked Bus Éireann to extend the closing date for payment to 4 August 2020. Families wishing to avail of transport for the 2020-2021 year are advised to make payment by this date.	spk_40
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_4	To reiterate, in line with normal practice, all children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated in school transport services where such services are in operation. The plans that are in place for school transport are absolutely based on the public health advice available. It has recommended that children are regarded as a single cohort, will be given designated seats on the bus to and from school, they will sit with a sibling or class member, and €11.3 million in funding will be available to ensure that hand sanitiser, PPE for the bus driver, the intensive clean that must be done after children have vacated the bus, will all be covered. The provision for the buses to operate as normal is on the basis of the public health advice recommendation and availability. It is operating, as all the roadmap is operating, on the public health advice that is given and provided.	spk_42

It is recognised that in preparing for full reopening schools may require some reconfiguration works to ensure that all available space, including class space, is used to maximise physical distancing safely. Adaption works may include, but are not limited to, reconfiguration of classroom space, repurposing rooms to provide additional space, adapting storage facilities, purchasing furniture, altering desk layouts and adapting toilet areas. As each school setting is different, a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate. Individual schools are best placed to decide on the appropriate reconfiguration works. As part of the package of supports, additional teachers are being provided to support the reopening of primary schools in order to provide enhanced substitution and eliminate the need to mix classes when a teacher is absent. Supply panels are being established nationwide. These will be monitored in terms of the number of teachers and the location of each panel. Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils, which is at its historically lowest level. In terms of operating in this school year, schools will be required to look at maximising all available physical space, particularly to accommodate larger classes. Examples of class layouts have been provided to support schools. The minor works grant is being provided to assist schools if they need to reconfigure classrooms or undertake other work. Schools will also be required to look at how classes are organised in terms of sizes, and this may require some reorganisation of class groupings. My Department absolutely will work with any school that needs extra support when other options are not feasible, and this may involve additional teachers or extra accommodation in some cases.	spk_28
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_6	Again, I confirm that substantial resources are going into schools to facilitate schools doing what needs to be done on the ground. I include in that, as we have already outlined, the €75 million that has been made available through the minor works grant. That funding is significant and substantial. In the first instance, it is a doubling of the minor works grant funding to primary schools and it is a similar but new strand of funding for second-level schools. There is great potential for schools to reconfigure and re-examine. For example, there are opportunities to declutter within the classroom. There are opportunities to look at additional space within the campus of the school and to look outside of that, where necessary. I accept that where there are exceptional cases all schools are invited to engage with the Department. There is a helpline for schools to allow them to flag individual needs within their schools. The resources and the supports are available. Everything that needs to be done will be done to ensure that schools can maximise their space and that there is every opportunity and expectation, which I know can be realised, that there will be a full and safe reopening of schools at the end of August or in early September.	spk_30
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_6	On that point, prior to 2016, teachers were allocated to primary schools at a general average of one teacher for every 28 pupils, but budget 2016 improved that ratio by one point to 27:1. Budget 2018 provided for a further point improvement to the staffing schedule so that teachers are allocated on a general average of one teacher for every 26 pupils, with effect since September 2018. This is the lowest pupil-teacher ratio ever at primary school. I am very conscious of the staffing schedule and the need to prioritise teacher allocations in primary schools given their vital role in communities across the country. I am looking at how best to make further progress in reducing the primary school teacher-pupil ratio in the context of the programme for Government implementation. I will continue to look at that in the context of the budget as we move forward.	spk_32
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Funding	dbsect_7	As the Deputy is aware, on Monday the Government published Roadmap for the Full Return to School, along with details of a financial package of over €375 million to support the implementation of the measures in the roadmap, following approval by the Government. The range of supports being made available to schools includes additional financial supports to provide for additional staffing, management supports, enhanced cleaning, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment, PPE, costs under the Covid-19 response plans. A Covid-19-specific capitation payment will be used as the mechanism to support the implementation of enhanced cleaning regimes in schools, with close to an additional €53 million for this purpose.  This will be provided on a sliding scale in line with pupil enrolments as at 30 September 2019, with €63 per mainstream pupil at primary level and €40 per pupil and post-primary level. Arrangements have also been made for a drawdown framework to be established to enable schools to purchase hand sanitisers and other PPE supplies for use in the school and classroom from pre-approved suppliers. The procurement process for this framework has already commenced, and it is intended that these materials will be available in early August. The funding for these materials will be provided in the form of a grant which will issue in instalments, the first of which will issue from mid-August to cover the period to December 2020. Enhanced Covid-19 rates are payable in respect of students attending special schools and special classes attached to mainstream schools to assist with the extra costs associated with the cleaning of classrooms operating in specialist provision.	spk_34
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Funding	dbsect_7	I thank the Deputy for raising that important point. I appreciate the pressures on schools and parents. Every effort is being made to ensure substantial funding is put in place to ensure no additional burden is placed on the school or on parents. There is a budget of €53 million for cleaning and all that involves, which is a substantial package of funding. We have also put in place further aid to ensure schools will be in a position to employ extra personnel in the month of August to help them to do the work that needs to be done on the ground. A further €4.3 million is being made available for that. It is a substantial resource and I have every confidence it will be well drawn down and well utilised by the schools.	spk_36
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Funding	dbsect_7	I would not accept that assertion at all. The roadmap is inclusive of all schools whether urban or rural. I come from a constituency that marries both so I am greatly conscious that the packages are made available on an urban and rural basis. A key innovation, perhaps more to the benefit of rural schools is the additional one day which will be given to teaching principals which is something of which they are richly deserving, and takes cognisance of the burden placed on them by the administrative work they need to do. A suite of measures has been put in place to the benefit of both urban and rural schools and for the benefit, most especially, of the children and young people that we serve in the education sector, irrespective of whether they are urban or rural.	spk_38
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_8	School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills. In the 2019-2020 school year more than 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million km at a cost of over €219 million in 2019. Earlier this week I announced a comprehensive plan detailing a package of measures and resources to be provided to facilitate schools in reopening. I also published a detailed roadmap for the full return to school. This roadmap set outs how schools will reopen for all students from the end of August. It has been developed in line with public health advice issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, the Roadmap for Society and Business, and follows comprehensive and intensive engagement with all relevant stakeholders, including Bus Éireann, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority on the logistical considerations that arise in planning for the operation of school transport services for the reopening of our schools. School transport scheme services operated by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department will fully operate as normal, in line with public health advice, when schools reopen for the 2020-2021 school year with the appropriate hygiene and other measures in place. In line with normal practice, all children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who complete the application and payment process on time, will be considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated, such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. All school transport services are reviewed over the summer months. Arising from this, routes may be altered, extended or withdrawn depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year.  The option to make payment for transport for the 2020-2021 school year is now available. Given the exceptional circumstances I have asked Bus Éireann to extend the closing date for payment to 4 August 2020. Families wishing to avail of transport for the 2020-2021 year are advised to make payment by this date.	spk_40
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_8	To reiterate, in line with normal practice, all children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated in school transport services where such services are in operation. The plans that are in place for school transport are absolutely based on the public health advice available. It has recommended that children are regarded as a single cohort, will be given designated seats on the bus to and from school, they will sit with a sibling or class member, and €11.3 million in funding will be available to ensure that hand sanitiser, PPE for the bus driver, the intensive clean that must be done after children have vacated the bus, will all be covered. The provision for the buses to operate as normal is on the basis of the public health advice recommendation and availability. It is operating, as all the roadmap is operating, on the public health advice that is given and provided.	spk_42
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_8	To a very clear question, I give a very clear answer, that which I have already given the Deputy. All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who complete the application and payment process on time, will be considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated. Such seats, as the Deputy is aware, are referred to as concessionary seats. That is a very clear answer - all children who are eligible.	spk_44
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Transport	dbsect_8	That is a clear answer.	spk_46
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I am particularly pleased to see the inclusion of a citizens' assembly on the future of education in the programme for Government. Experience internationally and here at home of citizens' assemblies as exercises in deliberative democracy have been extremely positive. Ireland is considered a leader in the use of deliberative democracy processes, having convened three in recent years, namely the Convention on the Constitution 2012 to 2014, the Citizens’ Assembly 2016 to 2018 and the ongoing Citizens' Assembly on gender equality which commenced in 2019. The first two exercises led to referendums being held on four issues, namely, reducing the age threshold for presidential candidates, marriage equality, removal of the offence of blasphemy and the eighth amendment. Typically, citizens' assemblies have been established by individual Oireachtas resolutions which have set out their terms of reference. I understand that initial proposals to hold a citizens' assembly on education have been informed by proposals from the Burren College of Art, which called for the assembly to examine issues such as how to properly position post-primary education for the 21st century and how to encourage greater creativity, student agency and resilience. My three-year strategy and annual implementation plan will incorporate priority actions from the programme for Government, including the citizens' assembly on the future of education. I aim to publish this strategy later this year.	spk_48
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I come from a strong education background and I believe strongly in educational equality and inclusiveness. I am a fan of the Citizens' Assembly and I will be hugely supportive of a citizens' assembly on the future of education because I believe in the democracy that it will represent. The terms of reference for the education citizens' assembly will be set out in the Oireachtas resolution establishing it. This will be informed by the views of all the relevant partners. That is fair and as it should be. Based on previous assemblies, the citizens' assembly on the future of education could be wide ranging, including constitutional issues, or it could focus on very specific areas of interest. Consultation informing the Oireachtas resolution could also consider whether the focus of the assembly should cover learning from cradle to grave or the primary and post-primary sectors. The other citizens' assemblies have considered constitutional provisions in relevant areas and a similar approach could be adopted for an education assembly. Other sources for topics could include the range of education-related commitments in the programme for Government, many of which are likely to generate considerable public interest and could benefit from debate in a citizens' assembly forum. It is worth noting that any such discussion in an assembly will complement rather than replace existing and extensive partner engagement fora in the sector. These include the work of the inspectorate and listening to the views of pupils, the primary education forum, industrial relations engagement mechanisms and our work with partners in responding to the pandemic.	spk_50
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I appreciate the genuine enthusiasm the Deputy has for the Citizens' Assembly. I share that enthusiasm because of the Citizens' Assembly's democratic and inclusive nature. At this point, four weeks into the job, I intend to formulate a three-year strategy and annual implementation plan which will incorporate priority actions from the programme for Government. This will include at its centre the citizens' assembly on the future of education. I will publish the details of that before the end of the year.	spk_52
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	My Department is working with education partners on measures to address anticipated teacher supply pressures arising from additional posts in the system and to meet the demand for teachers to fill short-term substitutable vacancies. I reiterate that the additional posts coming into the system are very positive news for the education sector. The Covid-19 environment is impacting on the willingness of teachers to travel and work abroad and we are hearing from post-primary schools that there are some improvements in supply this year as a result. In 2019-20, there were 2,800 teachers on part-time contracts and 1,300 job-sharing. My Department is also working with the Teaching Council to raise awareness of teacher supply in post-primary schools, focusing on teachers who are currently registered but not actively working in schools. The higher education institutions are working on more flexible arrangements for student teacher placement in post-primary schools also. This will facilitate student teachers to be available to their school for substitution and supervision while on placement. Student teachers will be paid for any hours worked outside their required placement hours. The Teaching Council is also working to allow teachers who qualified abroad to register and complete their induction programme here in Ireland for the coming school year. This move alone could see up to 200 additional newly qualified teachers becoming available to the system at post-primary level.	spk_54
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I believe the additional posts that have been announced will be a substantial benefit to the post-primary sector. We are very confident of the various pools that are available from which to draw those additional teachers, including the 1,300 who are currently job-sharing. For the first time, we will lift the bar on the number of hours teachers can work in terms of job-sharing. For the 2,800 teachers who are on part-time contracts, those hours can be extended. We also have the pool of students who are returning home and those who may choose not to go abroad.There are substantial avenues for us to find the resources. Following engagement with the Higher Education Authority, new initial teacher education, ITE, undergraduate programmes in a number of priority subject areas were put in place by higher education institutions for September 2019. Programmes included maths, modern foreign languages and Irish. More new undergraduate ITE programmes are planned for commencement this September. They will include Irish, modern foreign languages, mathematics and computer science. All of this will be of assistance.	spk_56
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputies. Regarding the induction of new teachers, Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan will be aware that the training facility is for the whole school community, including teachers who are already working in a school environment and new teachers who will come on stream. I am conscious that, under normal circumstances, new teachers coming on stream must be particularly nurtured. The Deputy will be aware that there is always a designated teacher to ensure that. Equally, a lead response worker in terms of Covid-19 will be appointed to each school. This will be a further support, not just for the overall school body, but where key issues are identified for the new teachers who are coming on stream. Schools work as a team and in a collaborative manner, and I have every confidence that this is how it will work in future. Regarding vetting, I am aware that there may be issues with the turnaround times for vetting. However, many teachers in the system are already vetted. Should there be a requirement for new vetting, we have discussed with the Garda National Vetting Bureau having an extremely quick vetting process for same, but most people in the education sector have already been vetted.	spk_60
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I appreciate the importance of the issue raised by the Deputy. I also appreciate her point about parents' intuition where their children are concerned. I recognise that the earlier the intervention, the more positive the outcome. I assure the Deputy that I will raise this issue with the Minister for Health and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I will continue to be supportive of the matters raised by Deputy Carroll MacNeill and endeavour to bring them to fruition as outlined by her.	spk_64
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy. On 8 May 2020 it was announced that the leaving certificate examinations were to be postponed and that calculated grades would be provided as an option for leaving certificate students for 2020. At that time, it was also announced that the grades would be finalised and issued for each student as close as possible to the traditional date of issue of the leaving certificate results. At no time was a definitive date for release of the 2020 calculated grades announced. The date of 7 September is the earliest possible release date given the rigorous and robust quality assurance checks required to ensure the process is executed with equity and fairness to all students and to ensure that the 2020 results enjoy the same status as those of previous years. The results will be available in time for round 1 offers from CAO and UCAS for colleges and universities in Ireland and UK. I have written to every European minister with responsibility for higher education and asked for Irish students to be accommodated. I have received assurances from the Dutch authorities that their higher education institutions are being advised to accommodate the entry of Irish students in September in view of the conditions caused by Covid-19. The recent announcement that the results would issue on 7 September has been portrayed perhaps as a delay but it is the additional three weeks that are required. More than 450,000 individual grades have to be prepared and subject to checks and balances as part of the national standardisation process. It is of vital importance that the process is given sufficient time to execute to the highest standards and to rigorous and robust quality assurance so that the results provided in 2020 enjoy the same status and value as the leaving certificates of previous and indeed those to come. The standardisation process is overseen by a national standardisation group. The group comprises representatives from the calculated grades executive office and the inspectorate, both from my Department; the Educational Research Centre and the State Examinations Commission. The group meets regularly to analyse and review the most recent iteration of the model and to discuss the outcomes and review how best to proceed in adjusting the model and also to work through the validation process. The Educational Research Centre has also been engaged to provide a data quality assurance and verification service on the data processing and standardisation processes.	spk_67
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	The single and only reason for the additional three weeks is to ensure that all possible robust checks and balances required to ensure the high quality and integrity of leaving certificate 2020 stands on a par with leaving certificate 2019 and 2021. The only agenda and objective here is that students will benefit and have confidence in the mechanism that has been used to provide the calculated grades. The additional time is necessary to ensure that the integrity and high quality is maintained so that the leaving certificate class of 2020 can stand with absolute confidence with the leaving certificate class of 2019 and the classes of 2021, 2022, or 2023 as we go forward. It is for the benefit of the students and the integrity of the exam that the additional three weeks is required.	spk_69
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy for raising this point. I have clarified it previously but there is no harm doing so again because it is very important to the students and the parents of the class of 2021. As the Taoiseach correctly said the curriculum will have to stand because at leaving certificate level there is no one mechanism for teachers to teach a particular aspect of the curriculum. They have the freedom to choose at any stage where they will begin within the curriculum. Acknowledging that point, the curriculum will continue but there will be the widest possible choice within the assessment of that curriculum. Therefore, for example, if there are six poets to be studied rather than just four appearing on the paper, all six will appear in the paper, or whatever mechanism is required to ensure there is the fullest and maximum opportunity for students to answer that paper. The Deputy will be aware that the entire process of the school reopening map has been one born of extensive engagement and consultation with the widest range of partners, including the voice of students and their representatives and their parents.	spk_71
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy for raising this question. This major building work is included in my Department’s construction programme which is being delivered under the national development plan. The project is currently at stage 1 of architectural planning which entails preliminary design of site and location suitability and initial sketch scheme. A review in 2019 of the demand for post-primary provision in the area resulted in an increase in the schedule of accommodation to cater for up to 1,300 pupils. My Department met with the school and the increase was accepted by the school. Initially, it had been anticipated that this project would be delivered in the form of an extension and refurbishment. However, through ongoing engagement with the school, its board of management and trustees, the option of a new build is currently being explored by my Department. The design team has been instructed to provide an initial sketch scheme for a 1,300-pupil school and submit it to my Department for review. The design team is currently finalising its report for presentation to the school and the Department.  Upon review, my Department will then be in contact with the board of management with regard to the further progression of the project.	spk_73
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I appreciate the points made by the Deputy about the difficulties on the ground. I should point out that the Department has made interim accommodation available, initially in November 2018 and then in February 2019, to take account of the growing school population. The approved provision comprises two science laboratories, a woodwork room, a prep room and four general classrooms. There is acknowledgement that there is a requirement for a school to accommodate 1,300 pupils and I confirm again that the design team has been instructed to provide an initial sketch scheme for that. It is being submitted to the Department for review. I assure the Deputy we will continue to work on that as a priority.	spk_75
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy and absolutely appreciate the very genuine concern that he has about moving forward this project for the school. He mentioned the minor works grant that is also available and there is an opportunity for schools to act within the Covid-19 provisions. I appreciate that because of its location and the accommodation demands of a school of 1,300 pupils, this should be expedited. My Department and I will take on board all the points raised by the Deputy and I thank him for doing so.	spk_77
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	"I thank the Deputy and appreciate his kind words. I welcome the publication of the ESRI report, The Implications of the Covid 19 Pandemic for Policy in Relation to Children and Young People: A Policy View My Department is acutely aware of the implications of the pandemic on the lives of pupils, including ""learning loss"" experienced by many students and the particular challenges facing students with special educational needs, many of whom may struggle to readjust with the routine of school in the autumn, and the importance of supporting the well-being of all our students and school community. Since schools closed on 12 March, my Department has provided a suite of supports and resources for schools, parents and students. Many of these are specifically targeted at supporting the most vulnerable students, including those with special educational needs and students at greatest risk of educational disadvantage. My Department, in consultation with educational support services such as the professional development service for teachers and junior cycle for teachers, and with agencies of the Department, including the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, the National Council for Special Education and the National Council for Guidance in Education, along with stakeholders has developed a three-phase approach to providing well-being supports on return to school. Supporting the well-being of school communities as they return is at the heart of this planning and maximising contact time with schools in the first term of the year ahead and re-establishing relationships with schools will be an absolute priority.  "	spk_79
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy for bringing that school to my attention. As he may be aware, we have 124 special schools throughout the country. We are always endeavouring to ensure that we accommodate all of our children with special needs. I will be taking this very seriously. In 2011 we had more than 6,000 schools. We now have almost 8,000 schools. As I said earlier, I am determined to ensure that no child with special needs is left without a place or without the same right of access as other children. That should not happen. This will be a priority for the Department of Education and Skills. I can give the Deputy a commitment in that regard. If he will pass the details of the case to me, I can follow up on it for him.	spk_84
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Further Education and Training Programmes	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy for his question. As I mentioned earlier, enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for this Government. Almost 20% of the education Vote, about €1.9 billion, is currently invested in supporting children with special needs. Notwithstanding this investment, there are some parts of the country, especially Cork and south Dublin, which I discussed earlier, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places for next September. The National Council for Special Education is interrogating this and exploring the available options. It has primary responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on special education provision for children nationwide. It has extensive engagement with schools, patrons, parents and others across south Dublin. Normally special school places are found through the reasonable efforts and full co-operation of everybody involved. Sometimes, however, this does not happen and we must engage with the relevant legislation, that is, section 37A of the Education Act 1998, as amended. This is an absolute priority of mine. I know that Scoil Colm, to which the Deputy has referred, includes another special school, Scoil Eoin, which has 150 pupils. There is potential for an additional four classrooms there. According to my deliberations and the considerations we have taken into account, the school would still come up short. However, we are working through this. The NCSE and the Archdiocese of Dublin met yesterday. The Christian Brothers own the school, but the archdiocese is assisting us in that regard. Talks are ongoing.	spk_90

I share that enthusiasm because of the Citizens' Assembly's democratic and inclusive nature. At this point, four weeks into the job, I intend to formulate a three-year strategy and annual implementation plan which will incorporate priority actions from the programme for Government. This will include at its centre the citizens' assembly on the future of education. I will publish the details of that before the end of the year.	spk_52
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_11	My Department is working with education partners on measures to address anticipated teacher supply pressures arising from additional posts in the system and to meet the demand for teachers to fill short-term substitutable vacancies. I reiterate that the additional posts coming into the system are very positive news for the education sector. The Covid-19 environment is impacting on the willingness of teachers to travel and work abroad and we are hearing from post-primary schools that there are some improvements in supply this year as a result. In 2019-20, there were 2,800 teachers on part-time contracts and 1,300 job-sharing. My Department is also working with the Teaching Council to raise awareness of teacher supply in post-primary schools, focusing on teachers who are currently registered but not actively working in schools. The higher education institutions are working on more flexible arrangements for student teacher placement in post-primary schools also. This will facilitate student teachers to be available to their school for substitution and supervision while on placement. Student teachers will be paid for any hours worked outside their required placement hours. The Teaching Council is also working to allow teachers who qualified abroad to register and complete their induction programme here in Ireland for the coming school year. This move alone could see up to 200 additional newly qualified teachers becoming available to the system at post-primary level.	spk_54
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_11	I believe the additional posts that have been announced will be a substantial benefit to the post-primary sector. We are very confident of the various pools that are available from which to draw those additional teachers, including the 1,300 who are currently job-sharing. For the first time, we will lift the bar on the number of hours teachers can work in terms of job-sharing. For the 2,800 teachers who are on part-time contracts, those hours can be extended. We also have the pool of students who are returning home and those who may choose not to go abroad.There are substantial avenues for us to find the resources. Following engagement with the Higher Education Authority, new initial teacher education, ITE, undergraduate programmes in a number of priority subject areas were put in place by higher education institutions for September 2019. Programmes included maths, modern foreign languages and Irish. More new undergraduate ITE programmes are planned for commencement this September. They will include Irish, modern foreign languages, mathematics and computer science. All of this will be of assistance.	spk_56
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	School Staff	dbsect_11	I thank the Deputies. Regarding the induction of new teachers, Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan will be aware that the training facility is for the whole school community, including teachers who are already working in a school environment and new teachers who will come on stream. I am conscious that, under normal circumstances, new teachers coming on stream must be particularly nurtured. The Deputy will be aware that there is always a designated teacher to ensure that. Equally, a lead response worker in terms of Covid-19 will be appointed to each school. This will be a further support, not just for the overall school body, but where key issues are identified for the new teachers who are coming on stream. Schools work as a team and in a collaborative manner, and I have every confidence that this is how it will work in future. Regarding vetting, I am aware that there may be issues with the turnaround times for vetting. However, many teachers in the system are already vetted. Should there be a requirement for new vetting, we have discussed with the Garda National Vetting Bureau having an extremely quick vetting process for same, but most people in the education sector have already been vetted.	spk_60

I also appreciate her point about parents' intuition where their children are concerned. I recognise that the earlier the intervention, the more positive the outcome. I assure the Deputy that I will raise this issue with the Minister for Health and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I will continue to be supportive of the matters raised by Deputy Carroll MacNeill and endeavour to bring them to fruition as outlined by her.	spk_64
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_13	I thank the Deputy. On 8 May 2020 it was announced that the leaving certificate examinations were to be postponed and that calculated grades would be provided as an option for leaving certificate students for 2020. At that time, it was also announced that the grades would be finalised and issued for each student as close as possible to the traditional date of issue of the leaving certificate results. At no time was a definitive date for release of the 2020 calculated grades announced. The date of 7 September is the earliest possible release date given the rigorous and robust quality assurance checks required to ensure the process is executed with equity and fairness to all students and to ensure that the 2020 results enjoy the same status as those of previous years. The results will be available in time for round 1 offers from CAO and UCAS for colleges and universities in Ireland and UK. I have written to every European minister with responsibility for higher education and asked for Irish students to be accommodated. I have received assurances from the Dutch authorities that their higher education institutions are being advised to accommodate the entry of Irish students in September in view of the conditions caused by Covid-19. The recent announcement that the results would issue on 7 September has been portrayed perhaps as a delay but it is the additional three weeks that are required. More than 450,000 individual grades have to be prepared and subject to checks and balances as part of the national standardisation process. It is of vital importance that the process is given sufficient time to execute to the highest standards and to rigorous and robust quality assurance so that the results provided in 2020 enjoy the same status and value as the leaving certificates of previous and indeed those to come. The standardisation process is overseen by a national standardisation group. The group comprises representatives from the calculated grades executive office and the inspectorate, both from my Department; the Educational Research Centre and the State Examinations Commission. The group meets regularly to analyse and review the most recent iteration of the model and to discuss the outcomes and review how best to proceed in adjusting the model and also to work through the validation process. The Educational Research Centre has also been engaged to provide a data quality assurance and verification service on the data processing and standardisation processes.	spk_67
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_13	The single and only reason for the additional three weeks is to ensure that all possible robust checks and balances required to ensure the high quality and integrity of leaving certificate 2020 stands on a par with leaving certificate 2019 and 2021. The only agenda and objective here is that students will benefit and have confidence in the mechanism that has been used to provide the calculated grades. The additional time is necessary to ensure that the integrity and high quality is maintained so that the leaving certificate class of 2020 can stand with absolute confidence with the leaving certificate class of 2019 and the classes of 2021, 2022, or 2023 as we go forward. It is for the benefit of the students and the integrity of the exam that the additional three weeks is required.	spk_69
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	State Examinations	dbsect_13	I thank the Deputy for raising this point. I have clarified it previously but there is no harm doing so again because it is very important to the students and the parents of the class of 2021. As the Taoiseach correctly said the curriculum will have to stand because at leaving certificate level there is no one mechanism for teachers to teach a particular aspect of the curriculum. They have the freedom to choose at any stage where they will begin within the curriculum. Acknowledging that point, the curriculum will continue but there will be the widest possible choice within the assessment of that curriculum. Therefore, for example, if there are six poets to be studied rather than just four appearing on the paper, all six will appear in the paper, or whatever mechanism is required to ensure there is the fullest and maximum opportunity for students to answer that paper. The Deputy will be aware that the entire process of the school reopening map has been one born of extensive engagement and consultation with the widest range of partners, including the voice of students and their representatives and their parents.	spk_71
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_14	I thank the Deputy for raising this question. This major building work is included in my Department’s construction programme which is being delivered under the national development plan. The project is currently at stage 1 of architectural planning which entails preliminary design of site and location suitability and initial sketch scheme. A review in 2019 of the demand for post-primary provision in the area resulted in an increase in the schedule of accommodation to cater for up to 1,300 pupils. My Department met with the school and the increase was accepted by the school. Initially, it had been anticipated that this project would be delivered in the form of an extension and refurbishment. However, through ongoing engagement with the school, its board of management and trustees, the option of a new build is currently being explored by my Department. The design team has been instructed to provide an initial sketch scheme for a 1,300-pupil school and submit it to my Department for review. The design team is currently finalising its report for presentation to the school and the Department.  Upon review, my Department will then be in contact with the board of management with regard to the further progression of the project.	spk_73
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_14	I appreciate the points made by the Deputy about the difficulties on the ground. I should point out that the Department has made interim accommodation available, initially in November 2018 and then in February 2019, to take account of the growing school population. The approved provision comprises two science laboratories, a woodwork room, a prep room and four general classrooms. There is acknowledgement that there is a requirement for a school to accommodate 1,300 pupils and I confirm again that the design team has been instructed to provide an initial sketch scheme for that. It is being submitted to the Department for review. I assure the Deputy we will continue to work on that as a priority.	spk_75
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_14	I thank the Deputy and absolutely appreciate the very genuine concern that he has about moving forward this project for the school. He mentioned the minor works grant that is also available and there is an opportunity for schools to act within the Covid-19 provisions. I appreciate that because of its location and the accommodation demands of a school of 1,300 pupils, this should be expedited. My Department and I will take on board all the points raised by the Deputy and I thank him for doing so.	spk_77
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Education Data	dbsect_15	"I thank the Deputy and appreciate his kind words. I welcome the publication of the ESRI report, The Implications of the Covid 19 Pandemic for Policy in Relation to Children and Young People: A Policy View My Department is acutely aware of the implications of the pandemic on the lives of pupils, including ""learning loss"" experienced by many students and the particular challenges facing students with special educational needs, many of whom may struggle to readjust with the routine of school in the autumn, and the importance of supporting the well-being of all our students and school community. Since schools closed on 12 March, my Department has provided a suite of supports and resources for schools, parents and students. Many of these are specifically targeted at supporting the most vulnerable students, including those with special educational needs and students at greatest risk of educational disadvantage. My Department, in consultation with educational support services such as the professional development service for teachers and junior cycle for teachers, and with agencies of the Department, including the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, the National Council for Special Education and the National Council for Guidance in Education, along with stakeholders has developed a three-phase approach to providing well-being supports on return to school. Supporting the well-being of school communities as they return is at the heart of this planning and maximising contact time with schools in the first term of the year ahead and re-establishing relationships with schools will be an absolute priority.  "	spk_79
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Education Data	dbsect_15	I thank the Deputy for bringing that school to my attention. As he may be aware, we have 124 special schools throughout the country. We are always endeavouring to ensure that we accommodate all of our children with special needs. I will be taking this very seriously. In 2011 we had more than 6,000 schools. We now have almost 8,000 schools. As I said earlier, I am determined to ensure that no child with special needs is left without a place or without the same right of access as other children. That should not happen. This will be a priority for the Department of Education and Skills. I can give the Deputy a commitment in that regard. If he will pass the details of the case to me, I can follow up on it for him.	spk_84
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_17	I thank the Deputy for his question. As I mentioned earlier, enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for this Government. Almost 20% of the education Vote, about €1.9 billion, is currently invested in supporting children with special needs. Notwithstanding this investment, there are some parts of the country, especially Cork and south Dublin, which I discussed earlier, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places for next September. The National Council for Special Education is interrogating this and exploring the available options. It has primary responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on special education provision for children nationwide. It has extensive engagement with schools, patrons, parents and others across south Dublin. Normally special school places are found through the reasonable efforts and full co-operation of everybody involved. Sometimes, however, this does not happen and we must engage with the relevant legislation, that is, section 37A of the Education Act 1998, as amended. This is an absolute priority of mine. I know that Scoil Colm, to which the Deputy has referred, includes another special school, Scoil Eoin, which has 150 pupils. There is potential for an additional four classrooms there. According to my deliberations and the considerations we have taken into account, the school would still come up short. However, we are working through this. The NCSE and the Archdiocese of Dublin met yesterday. The Christian Brothers own the school, but the archdiocese is assisting us in that regard. Talks are ongoing.	spk_90
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	"I am happy to be in the House again tonight having taken Oral Parliamentary Questions this morning. This week has been a very significant one for the schools sector. Following an intense period of weeks involving engagement with the education partners, I secured approval for the comprehensive plan that is ""Reopening Our Schools: the roadmap for the full return to school"" and, most important, the funding to implement it. The funding secured is significant. As Deputies know, it is over €375 million. What is most significant, however, is that the plan and the funding addresses all of the areas that need attention, including everything that needs to be addressed to get our schools open again, and to keep them open. As the challenges before us from Covid 19 have been worked through, the paramount consideration throughout has been to do the right thing by students, their families and school communities across the country. This is my first occasion to address a Statements on Education session in the Dáil as Minister for Education and Skills. In April, May and June I was a regular contributor to earlier sessions putting views and perspectives to my predecessor. Therefore, I am aware of the interest in education but also the concerns and at times the anxieties of students, their families, and their school communities. As I have said consistently since I was appointed Minister the number one priority for me, for the Government, my Department and the wider schools sector has been to reopen our schools fully and safely at the start of the new school year. In seeking to reopen our schools we said we would be guided by the available public health advice and comprehensive engagement with stakeholders, including the school management bodies and staff representatives as well as students and parents. There has never been any doubt that I as Minister, together with my Department, school leaders and staff all want to see schools reopening as normal for the new school year. In earlier debates some Deputies suggested that teachers, principals and other school staff had not been involved in the planning process which led to the roadmap being published. I assure the House that the staff unions of teachers, SNAs, school caretakers and secretaries, representatives of principals and deputy principals, school management bodies, and representatives of parents and post-primary students were all directly involved and worked intensively with my officials to work through the detail. I appreciate that some hold the view that the roadmap could have been published sooner. The roadmap is built on the available public health advice, it is the foundation of the roadmap. That public health advice was published on 1 July. We then needed to engage with the school staff and other partners to redesign elements of how we operate and resource our schools. Deputies were aware that it was my intention to publish such a roadmap by the end of this month and that has been the intention for the last number of weeks. The roadmap was published as soon as it could have been. Rather than publish a set of aspirations, it was right to work through identifying the supports needed, to build consensus among the education partners, to get Government agreement and then launch the roadmap. The roadmap gives the clarity, confidence and hope that students, their families and schools wanted and deserved. The roadmap and the funding package recognise the challenges faced by schools in ensuring the safe return of more than 1 million students and approximately 100,000 staff in 4,000 schools in the context of Covid-19. It sets out clear plans and practical guidance on the measures schools will need to take to operate safely and minimise the risk of the introduction and spread of infection in schools. There is guidance on training, checklists for schools on preparing for reopening and guidance for operating the school safely in a Covid-19 context.It advises on areas across logistics, curriculum, teaching, managing school activities, supporting pupils with additional needs, administration and well-being. In other words, in every sense, it is a comprehensive plan backed up with the necessary financial package. It represents achievable ambition. The published template Covid-19 response plans for schools provide clear and practical guidance and support to our schools on the range of measures that needs to be put in place to bring everyone back to school safely. The funding supports are comprehensive across a wide range of areas including funding for replacement staff who cannot come to school because they are regarded as very high risk of Covid-19, including teaching staff, SNAs and administrative staff. There is also funding for additional supply panels at primary level delivering more certainty around the availability of substitutes, funding for more than 1,000 additional teachers at post-primary level to help with physical distancing and class sizes, which includes 120 additional guidance posts, and funding to provide release days for teaching principals at primary level to meet the administrative burden arising from the changes and the impacts of Covid-19. There is also funding for enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures enabling schools to have daily cleaning arrangements and to purchase supplies of hand sanitiser and any other personal protective equipment required, funding for enhanced supervision, which is a key control measure to support schools to minimise the interaction of students from different classes, in line with public health advice, and funding to support school leadership, especially principals who are getting the schools ready. All schools will be able to employ an aide to help get the school ready and, as announced in the July stimulus package, funding of €75 million will support minor capital works for all schools. We know that most students, their families and school staff will be looking forward to going back, reconnecting with school, reconnecting with staff and friends and settling back into school work. There is a strong emphasis in the roadmap on safety, and on practical arrangements, but also on ensuring the well-being of the students and of the entire staff community. I am particularly pleased that the package includes the filling of 120 guidance posts. Some have asked how this figure was arrived at. It represents the full restoration of the number of guidance posts to 2011 levels. Also, some have asked how the additional National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists posts can be filled. There is an existing panel in place, which can be utilised immediately to fill some of the new 17 psychologist posts. In addition, a new recruitment competition has commenced, with interviews due to take place in the month of August, which will create new panels for all NEPS regions meaning all vacancies can be filled at that point. Statements sessions earlier in the summer were often dominated by calls to confirm that July provision would proceed this year. The summer programmes have in fact seen the number of participating schools, participating students and the eligibility for these programmes exceed previous years, acknowledging that there were challenges. Deputies might wish to note that 245 schools are participating in the summer based programme for children with complex needs, benefiting 3,900 students; a total of 10,604 parents registered for the home-based summer programme, benefiting 11,350 students; a total of 231 schools are participating in literacy and numeracy camps in DEIS primary schools, benefiting an expected 7,600 students, and 81 schools are participating in the DEIS post-primary summer programme, benefiting an expected 2,700 students. These programmes provide a crucial stepping stone in rebuilding the connection between students and their schools before they return more fully in the autumn as there is a particular focus on re-establishing relationships, building connections, meeting emotional needs and re-engaging in routines to support participation and learning. We know that we need to support the most vulnerable in particular in returning to school and the summer programme is a vital element in preparing these students for the return to school. In the context of assessments in the 2020-21 school year, given the autonomy of schools in deciding how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, it is not proposed to prescribe adjustments of the curriculum centrally. It is considered that the most appropriate way to reflect the challenges that have occurred for students in 2019-20 and potentially into 2020-21 is to incorporate adjustments into the certificate examinations in 2021. A key consideration in making these adjustments is the need to maintain familiarity with the structure of the questions and assessment components for students and teachers. The changes will be broadly proportionate but may vary, taking into account specific context across modules, subjects and programmes. In all cases they will involve some combination of students being provided with greater choice in written examinations, which will be supported through the provision of additional questions and-or adjustments to mandatory sections on written examination papers, the dates on which course work briefs are issued being brought forward to allow for additional preparation time for students and teachers, and in some subjects, adjustments to the requirements for practical examinations being made, reflecting the need to manage access to equipment to complete the preparatory aspects. I assure the House that full engagement with the education stakeholders will continue and that we are committed to supporting schools to prepare at local level for their reopening. There will also be comprehensive communication with students and parents so that they are fully informed over the coming weeks through the campaign already under way. I encourage Deputies to use their offices and contacts to highlight where parents and students in particular can get accurate information on the  I have said several times in contributions to the House this week that these are changed times during which as a country we have stood up to the challenges before us, showing great resilience, demonstrating tremendous community spirit and accepting the shared responsibility to fight the Covid 19 virus. We are committed to re-opening our society in every sense and the schools sector is preparing to get our students back into classrooms in the coming weeks. The Government is fully committed to supporting this return and has shown the scale of this commitment in the support package announced this week. There is an obligation on us as public representatives to show leadership and to ensure we support our students, our schools and our communities in getting back to school as normal in the coming weeks."	spk_630
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	I thank the Deputy for his questions. With regard to the commitment to special education, I am obliged to point out that 20% or one fifth of the annual budget for education is going to special education and children with special additional needs. That is very important and is a recognition of the importance of that sector in the education system. The Deputy referred to special education teachers with regard to substitution. A specific and clear measure has been introduced this year regarding substitution for schools. Obviously, it is important to have substitution available in the schools. The Deputy will be aware from his own experience that, at times, it can be difficult to find substitutes so what has been put in place is the national roll-out of a plan that was piloted over six different schools-----	spk_632

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	I welcome the Deputy's positive engagement and absolutely appreciate that there should be opportunities for him and other Opposition spokespersons to engage with both me and the Department on an ongoing basis over the coming weeks. I would value that positive engagement. There absolutely should be a national effort in which all of us come together to reopen the schools. I appreciate the wisdom and experience within this Chamber and in other places. I am very happy to work with the Deputy going forward, as are my officials, so he should feel free to engage with me in that respect. Regarding masks in schools, if I am picking up on the Deputy's point correctly, schools are operating on the basis of the public health advice. There is no requirement for masks within the school environment, unless a child has a particular need to wear a mask or if it is something that has been agreed because of an individual need within a school or whatever. However, it is not envisaged that masks would be worn. I absolutely appreciate the point the Deputy makes about special educational teachers. It was made by others but I did not have time to reply. In the first instance, we have the newly inaugurated national roll-out of the substitute panel, which is an opportunity for schools to take from that panel. There is also the school's panel. I suppose that every school has its own resource or pool of substitutes. Then there is the national text system, whereby schools also can draw down on substitutes. It is my intention that they will be the three streams that are utilised to source substitute teachers. I say that with absolute sincerity because I recognise and value the importance and the role of special educational teachers. Regarding school transport and the requirement for pay, as the Deputy has acknowledged, that has been extended until Tuesday. I will look into the matter but it has been extended from Friday to Tuesday. It is the absolute determination and intention at this point that the calculated grades system be a once-off and that we look to a return to the traditional leaving certificate for the new leaving certificate class of 2021. That is only right and proper and fair. I appreciate that we were in extraordinary times and required an extraordinary measure in the calculated grades system but it is absolutely the intention that we move towards a return to leaving certificate as we would know it in 2021. I will engage with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on the third level institutions. That is his brief and portfolio. I appreciate the issues the Deputy has raised. I am very conscious of them. I know of many young people and parents in particular who are hugely concerned about the issue of accommodation and how they will cater for children if they are to move to a reduced timetable. I can give the Deputy no further information on that at this point other than to say I will engage with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on it and ask him to revert to Deputy Ó Ríordáin.	spk_652

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	As for larger classes and the reconfiguration of school space, the Deputy will be aware of the €75 million I have previously mentioned that is being dispensed into schools to arrive next week to deal with how they can be reconfigured. That is the first option for schools, namely, to reconfigure classroom space or other spaces where there are general purpose areas, assembly areas or whatever and to provide the necessary space that is required. As for the issue of live-streaming, the Deputy will appreciate that a number of options are being made available. The various proposals are outlined as a consequence of engagement with the education partners as options for different schools to work through. Live-streaming is one of the proposals that has been put on the table.For schools who feel it is suitable to them or that it meets their needs, it is an option that is there. Not every school will take it up or require it but it is an option. There is the autonomy for each school to decide on their own what meets their needs best. On supervision and whether I am confident that supervision will be available for any measures of that nature, the Deputy will be aware that there is a substantial investment in supervision for second level schools. Additional hours are being made available to the schools to use as necessary at different times, whether at morning when they arrive, break times, or in a situation of this nature.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	The 1,000 teachers are actually 1,080. I will take this opportunity to explain to the Deputy how that will work. Each school will look at their own need. The hours available in each of those teaching posts will be 22 hours. Management will decide what is needed within the school, for example, an additional eight hours being needed for French and ten hours for physics or whatever the case may be. It will not necessarily mean that a single person will be in the school. The hours will be divided to meet the needs of the school at any given time. I have confidence that every principal will make the best judgment as regards the best use of those 22 hours. In some instances, it may be a single person but I expect from my own experience it will be a number of people who will cover the needs required within the school. Regarding the sourcing of the teachers, I have every confidence. Many of them, in my experience, are already in the school system. We have 1,300 job sharers, and for the first time we are raising the bar on the number of hours job sharers can work. They can extend their time. Equally, we have a number of part-timers already working in schools and their hours can be increased. We have more than 2,000 currently registered with the Teaching Council who are not currently working. Many of the schools already know who their substitutes are. They will have identified them. I have every confidence they can do it and this is a great boon and a great addition to the second level schools to have posts of that nature coming on stream. On guidance counsellors, the 120 figure restores the numbers to pre-2011 numbers and is a full restoration of guidance counselling hours. That is hugely positive because it is all tied up with the very strong resources we are putting into well-being within schools for our young people. Very substantial resources are also being put in place for the entire school community. That is also a very positive move and I know it is something the Deputy is particularly interested in.	spk_661
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	The lead worker representative is an important role within the school. It is a recognition of the need for co-ordination of Covid-19 measures within the school and it is a recognition that there needs to be a number of personnel who are to the fore. There is the principal, the deputy principal and senior members of staff. I know from experience that it will be a whole-school engagement and effort, but there will be reduced hours available for the individual who takes up the lead worker role. I have every confidence that position is being mooted within schools. It is like any other position taken up within schools. Where a need is identified within a school, somebody will be put in place. Obviously, it is voluntary in terms of the person taking it up, but it is hugely important role. It is an acknowledgement of the need to streamline how schools will operate. In tandem, there is a further resource going into the schools to support the roll-out of Covid-19 measures in advance of schools opening, and that is the individual who will operate as an aide in the school for the next number of weeks. There are a number of measures and the lead worker representative is compensated by means of a reduced timetable within the school.	spk_663
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	There will be the normal supports in place in terms of helplines and so on. Students will receive their results via the portal, but I know from personal experience that schools will always be open to support and to walk with, before and behind their students. I have every confidence schools will want to play a role, but in the first instance the results will go via the portal to the students themselves. I have every confidence that schools will want to be there in a supportive role.	spk_666
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	I thank the Deputy for his support for me as Minister and for the entire education community. We must make every possible effort to work collaboratively to ensure we can safely and fully reopen schools in late August or September, depending on the individual schools. The Deputy highlighted the importance of SNAs in schools. I absolutely acknowledge that and I have first-hand experience of the invaluable role they play in supporting children with special educational needs. They are a hugely important part of the supports available to children with significant additional needs. SNA numbers have grown substantially, as the Deputy knows, and are now more than 60% higher than they were even ten years ago. We currently have more than 17,000 SNAs in schools supporting more than 35,000 students. Their role and its importance in the school system cannot be emphasised enough. In regard to the use of PPE, for SNAs who are dealing with intimate care or whatever the needs of the student might be, PPE will of course be a necessity. I appreciate the Deputy's point about the importance of everybody within the school community, including pupils, parents, teachers and staff, being aware of the symptoms of Covid-19, and the obligation on everybody within the school sector to stay at home if they are experiencing those symptoms. Once we open the schools, the most important thing is that we are able to keep them open. For that to happen, there is an obligation on all who engage with and interact in the school environment to know when it is best to stay at home. I take the Deputy's point that questions of funding, in any shape or form, must not stand in the way of schools reopening or the best care and services being provided for the children and young people we serve. To be fair, the package of more than €375 million is a very strong endorsement from Government of the importance of the education sector and, even more so, the importance of the children who are at the centre of it. The resources and supports are there and I have every confidence that the goodwill is also there to ensure schools can safely reopen and students and staff can safely return to classrooms.	spk_671
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	I reiterate that I appreciate the Deputy's positive engagement on all these issues up to this point. The matter of fee-paying schools is an important one as questions have been raised around it. I confirm that all fee-charging schools have been contacted by my Department to advise them that while schools outside of the free schemes are not automatically covered by the minor works grant, the Department absolutely recognises that there may well be circumstances in which fee-charging schools require some support to implement necessary reconfiguration works, as envisaged under the Roadmap for the Full Return to School, to facilitate reopening. These schools have also been advised that in exceptional circumstances, they can seek assistance from the Department for staffing or financial supports where they can demonstrate particular challenges brought about by the impact of Covid-19. They can also seek support to implement any measures that might be required to limit the risk of spreading infection. In addition, the additional allocation of guidance counsellor hours absolutely includes the fee-charging schools. Of course, schools will be required to demonstrate clearly their difficulties in implementing necessary control measures and how the provision of additional supports would help them to overcome those particular difficulties. Additional supports will be considered in the context of education provision in the mainstream schools. I appreciate the Deputy raising this matter and I confirm that all these schools are eligible to apply for aid, should they have a specific need and requirement.	spk_673

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	On the issue of children or young students on buses, the buses are operating on the basis of the public health advice that has been given. That advice suggests that children in primary school, and older children at second level, be regarded as one single cohort. That means that the same children get on the bus every day. They will be assigned specific seats and will sit with a sibling or a child in their class. When they get on the bus, there will be hand sanitiser and wipes if needed, and PPE will be provided for the bus driver. I confirm that children under the age of 13 will not be required to wear masks on the bus and that children over 13 will. As they are a single cohort, the buses will operate as normal or as has been traditional for them. An investment of €11.3 million is being made available for any works that might need to be done on the buses, including providing PPE for the bus drivers, hand sanitiser and wipes, the cleaning of the buses once the children leave them, and so on. They will be operating in that manner on the basis of the public health advice and nothing else.	spk_678
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	I appreciate the Deputy's point. I do not mean to repeat myself, but the funding of €75 million that has been made available to the schools is intended for providing space within the schools themselves in the first instance. They should look within their own classrooms, declutter them and remove all excess furniture. They can also look at other areas outside the classroom, like the general assembly or general purpose area, which they can reconfigure. It is believed that there may well be significant options within the schools. If all of that fails, they have the option of looking outside the campus and if they cannot immediately find space in their own campuses, they can look at local halls or whatever else may be available. That is not the first option and they have to be able to show that there was a justifiable need for them to do so. In other words, all other options within the school campus must be exhausted first.	spk_680
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	I thank the Deputy for his questions. I assume the Deputy is asking what will happen when substitution is not available in a school. There are several streams or options within schools regarding substitution. I repeat that there is a national roll-out of a substitute panel. Importantly, and perhaps I did not say this already, it was piloted first in six places and a number of posts are being made available so that more than 60 areas around the country will have substitute panels. I want to be clear that if the number currently specified needs to be increased to meet the needs of schools, it will be increased. For this reason, I do not believe that special education teachers will be required to relinquish their role in the school. I value the work of special education teachers. As I said, there are other options available. There is the substitute panel, the pool the school would normally use for substitutes and the national text line. I would like to think that all those options will be exhausted. Those are the first and main options but I reiterate that if a substitute panel requires more teachers to ensure it is operating fully, then that will be done.  Regarding specialist rooms in schools, I confirm that in those rooms the number of students is reduced to the usual numbers that would be there because of the nature of the subjects. That will be very positive regarding social distancing. If there are exceptional measures, every opportunity to limit the number of students in a room or the option of looking at other rooms within a campus should be utilised. From my personal knowledge of the situation, the advantage I see is that the numbers in those classes are already reduced, which I believe will be of some help.	spk_683

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	That is a matter the Deputy will have to take up elsewhere, as it is beyond my remit. Regarding works being carried out in schools and being resourced and carried out in time, the Deputy referred to many of the schools having previously applied to the Department for necessary and perhaps emergency works, including minor works, etc., and being refused funding. I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that the money for the works to be carried out in the next several weeks will be arriving in the schools next week. The money, not just for the works but for the additional aide or individual who will help to prepare each school in August, with the support of the management, will also be arriving in schools. There is, therefore, an absolute commitment that the funding and works that need to be done will be resourced and, as a sign of good faith, that funding will arrive before the end of next week. Regarding the Deputy's concerns about the timeframe, the minor works grant is a process with which primary schools are familiar. The schools are well used to operating it and know what it involves. Before any announcement was made, principals, deputy principals and management in schools knew exactly where that money had to be spent. Likewise, although it is a new form of funding for second level schools, they also know what needs to be done. I have been greatly heartened by the videos I have seen and the messages that have come in from principals. They are getting down to work and making the adjustments and arrangements that need to be put in place. I am sure the Deputy has also seen many of these messages on social media. They are positive, proactive and demonstrate a worthwhile engagement from all involved in the school sector. Principals are very keen to reopen schools safely and well.	spk_691

The leaving certificate results come out on 7 September, which will be fully in time for UCAS and there has been engagement in that regard. On the wider issue of students taking up university places in third level institutions elsewhere in Europe, I have written to my counterparts throughout Europe regarding students having the opportunity to take up places and asking that they adopt a flexible approach. We have had positive engagement on that issue and we have heard recently from the Netherlands that the educational authorities there have written to all their institutions advising them to show similar flexibility.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	I thank the Deputy for raising the question. I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from when he said he did not know whether to refer to yesterday or today. I am not sure which it is, we have been here so long. I appreciate that the Deputy has raised an important issue and it is a matter of concern for the students who will comprise the leaving certificate class of 2021 and for their parents. The Deputy is correct, as I told him earlier, that the curriculum itself cannot change because there is no way of identifying what was taught at different times in different schools. The curriculum has to remain the same. Offering the option of a wider choice is that fairest system in terms of allowing the curriculum to stand but adjusting the assessment aspect of it. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has worked on the issue, that is, on the guidelines that will relate to all subjects and how they will be adjudicated upon. It has also worked on other programmes within schools that will be important for them going forward, including transition year and other innovations of that nature. All of those options will be available on the return to school and the information will be freely available to the students as they return. They must get that information because the earlier they know, the better. That will give them confidence in terms of how they will approach their leaving certificate. My opinion at this stage is that it is the fairest way for students to have an adjustment in terms of choice on the paper and how the papers will be examined.	spk_697

He will appreciate that the roadmap covered quite an amount of aspects, including cleaning, panels of substitution, additional posts or whatever. As I previously outlined to the Deputy, all of those aspects, including curriculum and assessment, were discussed at great length with the partners in education and the broadest section of representative voices. As a consequence, the roadmap was put together and, as I said, it includes addressing curriculum and assessment. The consultation has taken place in that respect. The guidance on the curriculum is now being brought forward and will be available to the schools in time for their reopening.	spk_701
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	I note the Deputy's concern and thank him for it. There was full engagement in bringing forward many and all of the initiatives that are in the roadmap. I confirm to the Deputy that the guidelines will be available. I believe those guidelines are in the best interests of the students. I have not heard at any point that students are not happy with the proposals, which are very fair. It would not be acceptable to interfere with the curriculum but it is manageable and right, and will be fair, that there will be an adjustment in the assessment method for the benefit of all concerned. I think students will see those changes for what they are and I reiterate that students were represented in the partners in education consultation. I am confident that what is being proposed is in the best interests of all.	spk_703
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-30	dail	33	Opening of Schools and Calculated Grades: Statements	dbsect_86	My opening remarks allowed me to set out again the commitment of the Government and my Department to the education of our schoolgoing students, and their families, schools and communities. I could use the time available to me to detail again all that has been done in the school sector, but the roadmap for reopening our schools has been published and is available to all on  I have listened carefully to contributions from Deputies today and on every other occasion on which I have spoken in the House. I was in the House to take priority questions earlier. I was in both Houses on Tuesday. I have been impressed by the engagement and interest shown by Deputies and the shared commitment to reopen schools safely and fully. I am very much aware that our schools are rooted in local communities and that we must ensure in the coming weeks that each school can reopen safely, remain open and, as we work to implement the programme for Government, can develop and meet the demands of communities in the longer term. There are challenges to reopening our schools over the coming weeks, but there has been significant resilience and initiative shown across society since March. By working together, we can get the work that is needed done to reopen our schools fully and safely. The reopening of our schools is a major logistical undertaking, and I know that has been a much-used phrase. I also know that some have expressed concerns about whether there is enough time to prepare, whether additional staff will be required and available and what might happen if there are outbreaks of the virus. We will all work together through any challenges that emerge. My Department is available to schools to support them in any particular challenges that might emerge. In the longer term, the programme for Government offers the framework for us to address many of the issues which Deputies and others have raised with me in recent weeks, including reform of the curriculum to include a focus on modern languages, digital skills and inclusion, enhancing how we support our language and culture, how we fund and resource our schools, including capitation payments, class sizes and support staff in schools, and how we can improve the school transport system to make it more sustainable in every sense of the word. I look forward to the establishment of a citizens' assembly on education, as it will give us a vehicle to debate some of the fundamental issues that Deputies and Senators have raised over the course of this week in different sessions with me. This House will go into recess tomorrow, but I and my Department will continue to work towards their priorities of reopening our schools and delivering leaving certificate calculated grades to 60,000 students on 7 September. Many of the students will have received those results and offers of further and higher education places by the time we have the opportunity to debate education matters in the House again. Our schools will also have reopened. As the Minister with responsibility for education and a former teacher, I know how important education is for our young people. Everything I, my Department and the education partners do is motivated by the best interests of the children and young people that we serve. Our schools in every sense, including their students, families and staff, are at the centre of our communities. Perhaps it took the restrictions which were necessary to combat the Covid-19 virus for us as a society to make that connection once again. We are truly all in this together, and we will continue to work with all concerned to the benefit of our students across the country, not just in the weeks ahead but in the years ahead as we strengthen and invest in our school sector.

On 13 April 2018, the Minister for Education and Skills announced 42 new schools to open between 2019 and 2022. A preliminary site identification process was undertaken in respect of any of the schools for which there had not yet been a site identified. In the first instance, this exercise sought to identify State-owned property which may potentially serve as a location to provide accommodation for the new school referenced. The Department of Education and Skills portfolio of Minister-owned property and the State Property Register were considered for this purpose. Generally, all new schools commence operation in temporary accommodation with a view to permanent accommodation being provided for them by my Department as quickly as possible. As the Deputy will be aware, Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together national school is currently located in temporary accommodation at Suttonians Rugby Club.

The interests of students and their families as well as the safety of the staff in the sector have been the paramount considerations throughout as the challenges before us from Covid-19 have been worked through. Coming from an education sector background, and as a regular contributor to the debates on education in the Dáil before becoming Minister for Education, I was keenly aware of the interest in education but also the concerns and at times the anxieties of students, their families, their school communities and, more generally, how those challenges were being addressed. Since my appointment as Minister, the number one priority for me, the Government, my Department and the wider schools sector has been to reopen our schools fully and safely at the start of the new school year. We said that in reopening our schools we would be guided by the available public health advice and comprehensive engagement with stakeholders, including the school management bodies and staff representatives, as well as students and parents. There has never been any doubt but that I as Minister, my Department, school leaders and staff all want to see schools reopen as normal in the new school year in late August and into September based on their normal timeframes. Yesterday I brought proposals to Cabinet which outlined a comprehensive funding package and plan to provide the necessary supports and clear guidance for primary and post-primary schools to return safely in the new term. I also sought approval to publish a roadmap for the full return to schools, described yesterday by An Taoiseach as the most comprehensive and detailed sectoral plan he has seen. Cabinet agreed to both, and I was able to publish the roadmap yesterday together with details of the €375 million-plus in additional funding necessary to support the roadmap. The motion from Sinn Féin before the House calls for a roadmap. We have delivered the roadmap. The Deputies were aware that it was my intention to publish such a roadmap by the end of this month. That has been the intention for the last number of weeks. My colleagues in government and I have always recognised that schools would need to be supported to reopen. The roadmap I published outlines a comprehensive range of measures being provided to support the full reopening of schools in time for the start of the new school year in late August, early September. The roadmap was developed following intensive engagement with stakeholders from the education sector, including staff unions of teachers, SNAs, school caretakers and secretaries, representatives of principals and deputy principals, school management bodies and representatives of parents and post-primary students.The roadmap and the funding package recognise the challenges faced by schools in ensuring the safe return of more than 1 million students and approximately 100,000 staff in 4,000 schools in the context of Covid-19. It sets out clear plans and practical guidance on the measures schools will need to take to operate safely and minimise the risk of the introduction and spread of infection in schools. The roadmap and its accompanying documentation provides schools with guidance on training, checklists for schools on preparing for reopening and guidance for operating schools safely in a Covid context. It advises on areas across logistics, curriculum, teaching, managing school activities, supporting pupils with additional needs, administration and well-being. In other words, it is a comprehensive plan. My Department has prepared a suite of support materials for schools, including guidance on curriculum, well-being of students, well-being of staff as well as protocols for minimising the risk of spread of infection in schools. In addition, I also published template Covid-19 response plans for schools. These plans provide clear and practical guidance and support to schools on the range of measures that need to be put in place to bring everyone back to school safely. The funding supports are comprehensive across a wide range of areas. There will be funding for replacement staff for those who cannot come to school as they are at very high risk of Covid-19. This includes teaching staff, special needs assistants and administrative staff. This can occur where staff members who are identified in line with HSE guidance as at very high risk of Covid-19 are advised to cocoon. Funding for additional supply panels at primary level is provided for. This will ensure more certainty around the availability of substitutes for primary schools. Also in the package is funding for more than 1,000 additional teachers at post-primary level to help with physical distancing and class sizes. This will include 120 additional guidance posts. There will be funding to provide release days for teaching principals at primary level to meet the administrative burden arising from the changes and the impacts of Covid-19. This will mean that all teaching principals will have one release day per week and this is something which I am particularly pleased to be able to deliver as I consider it an essential support to reduce the burden on these principals. In addition, there will be some release time for deputy principals in primary schools. Enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures are particularly important and the additional funding being provided will enable schools to have daily cleaning arrangements and to purchase supplies of hand sanitiser and any other personal protective equipment, PPE, necessary. There is also funding for enhanced supervision, which is a key control measure to support schools in minimising interaction of students from different classes, in line with public health advice. Funding will be provided to support school leadership, especially principals, in getting the schools ready. All schools will be able to employ an aide to help get the school ready. As announced in the July stimulus package, funding of €75 million will support minor capital works for all schools. As I said, reopening schools is a priority for Government and has been my priority since becoming Minister for Education and Skills. In preparing for the reopening of schools, we know that most students, and indeed their families and school staff, will be looking forward to going back, reconnecting with school, reconnecting with staff and friends and settling back into school work. There is a strong emphasis in the roadmap on safety, and on practical arrangements, but also on ensuring the well-being of the students and of the entire staff community.  One of the key elements to ensuring that schools once they reopen can remain open is to prevent the Covid-19 virus from getting into a school in the first instance. This will mean students, their families and staff playing their roles in keeping the virus out of their school by ensuring those who have symptoms or suspect they have the virus stay out of school, by maintaining best practice in terms of hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette in school and by minimising social contacts and respecting physical distancing practices. Reopening our schools is not just a matter of achieving a certain minimum physical distancing. It is about getting students re-engaged fully with learning and socialising with their peers. For some it will be about preparing for examinations, for others it will involve transitioning to school life or to a different level in terms of moving from primary to post-primary. Students need the support of their families, teachers and school staff in readjusting to school life and physical learning environments again. It is realistic to predict that all students, parents, teachers and other school staff will experience a broad range of feelings as part of the return to school. This may include a mixture of excitement, happiness and relief but may also include anxiety and fear. This is understandable given these circumstances and there is a response in place to support the well-being of our school communities as part of the planning to return to school. I can assure the House that there is full engagement with the education stakeholders and that everyone is committed to supporting schools to prepare at a local level for their reopening. There will also be comprehensive communication with students and parents so that they are fully informed over the coming weeks. That information campaign has already commenced. My Department is providing dedicated and direct contact channels to schools so that where issues might arise they can be resolved quickly. Government has provided a comprehensive plan and supports to ensure we can reopen our schools but we must all continue to work together to achieve the goal of seeing our schools reopen.  I am the first to acknowledge the support and engagement of my counterpart in Northern Ireland on matters vitally important to our sectors. However, it is worth noting that, North of the Border, return to school guidance was issued by the Department of Education in Northern Ireland on 24 June setting out plans to reopen on 24 August to certain year groups. It is expected that some schools will only be able to return partially with a minimum standard of blended learning. This will include a minimum 40% face-to-face learning in primary and perhaps 50% in post-primary. No additional funding has yet been committed to support schools in their preparations for reopening. Detailed guidance has yet to issue on curriculum, transport and well-being measures as well as catering, risk assessments and human resources management. The Sinn Féin motion suggests that the summer programmes have fallen far short of Government announcements. In fact, the number of participating schools and students and the eligibility for those programmes exceeds previous years. Deputies may wish to note that 245 schools are participating in the summer-based programme for children with complex needs, benefiting 3,900 students. These programmes are providing a crucial stepping stone in rebuilding the connection between students and their schools before they return more fully in the autumn as there is a particular focus on re-establishing relationships, building connections, meeting emotional needs and re-engaging in routines to support participation and learning. As the Taoiseach reiterated today, since coming into office, this Government has been working tirelessly on reopening our society and the reopening of our schools is a vital part of that. Government has committed the necessary supports and funding to the schools sector. Therefore, I ask this House to reject the Sinn Féin motion and to support my countermotion which recognises the work undertaken by Government, my Department and the education partners working in collaboration to develop the roadmap to reopen our schools and over the coming weeks to see it delivered successfully. As I said in the Seanad earlier today, these are changed times. As a country we have stood up to the challenges before us and we have seen great resilience, tremendous community spirit and a shared responsibility to contribute to the fight against the virus. We are now committed to reopening our society in every sense and the schools sector is now preparing to get our students back into classrooms in the coming weeks. Government is fully committed to supporting that return and has shown the scale of that commitment in the support package announced yesterday. I know Deputies in this House will support our students, our schools and our communities in getting back to school as normal in the coming weeks. Faoi mar a bhí riamh, ní neart go cur le chéile.	spk_399
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-16	dail	33	Estimates for Public Services 2020	dbsect_19	"I move the following Revised Estimates:
            That a sum not exceeding €10,133,218,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 2020, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education and Skills, for certain services administered by that Office, and for the payments of certain grants. Tá áthas orm a bheith anseo os comhair Dáil Éireann inniu chun labhairt faoi Mheastacháin athbhreithnithe mo Roinne do 2020. Tá obair thábhachtach á déanamh ag mo Roinn san earnáil oideachais agus tá mé ag tnúth go mór leis an dúshlán atá romhainn. Liom inniu, tá an tAire, an Teachta Harris, atá anois mar Aire le cúraimí don ardoideachas agus don bhreisoideachas, agus an tAire Stáit ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna, an Teachta Niall Collins. I mo theannta freisin, tá an tAire Stáit ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna, an Teachta Madigan, atá cúraimí ar leith uirthi maidir le oideachas speisialta. Tá oifigigh ó mo Roinn anseo freisin. It is a great honour to present the Revised Estimates 2020 for the Department of Education and Skills to the Dáil. This is a challenging time for Ireland's society and economy and particularly for the education sector, which has been massively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Students at all levels have had their education dramatically affected. However, through the efforts of all concerned we are coming through this crisis. Currently, the first priority for me, my Department and the wider school sector is to reopen our schools as fully, normally and safely as possible at the start of the new school year. This is an issue to which I will return later. I will begin by explaining that the Revised Estimates do not reflect the decision announced by the Taoiseach on 27 June last to establish a new Department of further and higher education, research, innovation and science. As such, the Revised Estimates are for Vote 26, which has been the overall Vote for education and skills to date. Work is under way on the establishment of the new Department under the Minister, Deputy Harris. This work will involve the separation of significant elements of Vote 26 into a new Vote for that Department. When the work on allocating those parts of Vote 26 into the separate Vote for the Department of further and higher education, research, innovation and science is complete, I will return to the House with further Revised Estimates for the Vote of the Department of Education and Skills. I look forward to working with the new Minister for further and higher education, research, innovation and science and the Minister of State with responsibility for further education and skills, Deputy Niall Collins, as our two Departments co-operate on their complementary work in the education and skills sector. The further Revised Estimates Volume will also reflect the inclusion in the responsibilities of my Department of the area of educational welfare and the school completion programme. These are currently under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and work is also under way to progress the transfer of these functions to my Department. The allocation of the relevant funds will be included in the further Revised Estimates in the autumn. The Covid-19 crisis has impacted deeply on the education sector. Its impact on school and college students has been profound. While schools and teachers did their best to teach remotely and while home schooling became the norm for many parents and their children, that was no substitute for the classroom.Vital opportunities for social interaction, so important to our younger students, were lost for a number of months. We all know the impact of the crisis on those due to undertake State examinations this summer. Trojan efforts have been made by all concerned to put in place alternative arrangements for this year that will ensure students receive calculated grades on a fair an equitable basis and thereby proceed to enter college or to pursue other career paths in the normal manner. I wish to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt appreciation to all those across the sector who have worked tirelessly to lessen the impact of the pandemic on our students. They have succeeded in putting in place alternative arrangements for those wishing to progress to and within tertiary education and in planning for the reopening of our schools and colleges in completely unprecedented circumstances. This includes teachers, school principals, school managers, special needs assistants, SNAs, school secretaries, school caretakers and indeed the entire school community. In addition, I pay tribute to the work of parents, who have worked so hard to support home schooling since March of this year. Above all, I commend the students and pupils themselves on their patience and flexibility in adapting to very changed circumstances for the delivery of their education. As I mentioned earlier, I am absolutely committed to the goal of reopening our primary and post-primary schools as normal at the end of the summer. My officials are working closely with all stakeholders to achieve this goal, which is so important for all our students. There are a number of components to school reopening. As Deputies will be aware, I recently published interim public health advice, which was provided to my Department by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. This advice is informing the development of clear guidelines for implementation in schools. We all want to support the education system in order that we can welcome our pupils and staff across our school communities back into a safe environment. We will continue to work with the public health experts over the summer to update the interim advice as necessary. In my engagement with stakeholders since my appointment I have been struck by everyone's commitment to providing the best possible experience for the entire school community to return to school as fully, normally and safely as possible. A number of challenges arise in reopening schools. These challenges include physical distancing arrangements, the need for enhanced cleaning and hygiene routines and issues relating to school transport. Once schools reopen, however, the challenge will be to prevent Covid-19 from getting into schools in order that they can remain open. This will call for a joint effort on the part of all involved, with those who have symptoms or suspect they have the virus staying out of schools, best hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette practice being maintained in schools, and minimising social contacts and respecting physical distancing practices where practical to do so. There are well-being aspects and curricular challenges to be identified and addressed. I assure the House that all these matters are receiving appropriate attention. I reiterate that it is my utmost priority that student and staff safety and well-being should be to the forefront of all this planning. These Estimates were drawn up in late 2019 as part of the 2020 budgetary process. Much has changed since then, and I will return to the House for approval of additional costs associated with Covid-19 measures needed to reopen schools for what will by then be the Department of education, with the appropriate funds reallocated to the newly established Department of further and higher education, research, innovation and science. The gross voted allocation for the Department of Education and Skills in 2020 is €10.569 billion. This breaks down to approximately €9.647 billion in current expenditure and €922 million in capital expenditure. When the appropriations-in-aid income of €435 million is taken into account, the net voted allocation for the Department is €10.13 billion. The non-voted National Training Fund, NTF, has an allocation of €623 million, resulting in a total gross allocation for the Department of nearly €11.2 billion. This represents an increase of nearly €325 million, which is 3% above the Department's allocation for 2019. The Department of Education and Skills Vote comprises three programmes: programme A, first, second and early years education; programme B, skills development; and programme C, higher education. A significant proportion of this Vote is expended on pay and pensions, with some of the almost €7.9 billion included in the Vote for these purposes and a further €236 million in pay being included in the NTF allocation. Some 113,000 public servants and 50,000 public service pensioners are paid out of these funds. Other significant expenditure areas include capital infrastructure, non-pay grants to State agencies, school transport, capitation grants and student supports. The additional allocation in 2020 will deliver a range of measures in the education and training system. It will support an additional 1,600 posts in schools, including approximately 1,000 SNA posts and approximately 580 net additional teacher posts, catering for demographics and additional special classes. These investments will ensure more than 1,300 new special class places. Schools will receive a 2.5% increase in capitation from September 2020, with an increase of €4.8 million in school funding in a full year. A €1 million investment fund for a new pilot that aims to provide free schoolbooks is now available to more than 100 primary schools that are part of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme. Special education is a particular focus of these Estimates, with more than €1.9 billion, or one fifth, of this budget to be spent on recruiting additional SNAs and teachers to work in our special schools and mainstream schools. As a result of this investment, there will be 17,000 SNAs in our schools in the coming school year. This is a record level of resources to be allocated to this area, and I look forward to working with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, as we ensure that these resources are used to ensure that all pupils, whatever their special needs, are able to access the education that allows them to reach their full potential. Support for small schools is to be provided for in the Estimates, with improved teacher staffing levels for schools with four or fewer teachers. A one-point reduction in the staffing schedule will help ensure better teacher retention in smaller schools. The improved schedule will apply in two, three and four-teacher schools and ensure one fewer pupil is required to retain or recruit a teacher. School leadership will continue to be supported, with one additional release day being provided for primary school teaching principals. The additional time to carry out administrative duties will apply to some 1,760 schools with fewer than seven teachers. A significant capital budget of €922 million is being provided for in 2020 and will contribute to the development of new, bigger and more energy-efficient school buildings and third level facilities. Of this provision, almost €748 million will be invested in schools, including investment in ICT, and some €174 million is being invested in the tertiary education and training system. This investment will deliver more than 30,000 school places and build on the work that has seen €3 billion invested in these building projects since 2016. The Department's allocation includes a package of nearly €99 million in measures in the tertiary education system. This includes almost €70 million in funding arising from an increase in the NTF levy, which is non-voted expenditure. Supports aimed at providing more third level opportunities are also being provided, with a fund worth €60 million being made available for higher education institutions that seek to create new and diverse courses to expand the number of student places while preparing young people for a fast-changing world of work. This investment is part of the five-year €300 million human capital initiative established from within the NTF surplus and will add capacity across higher education to meet priority skills needs for enterprise, drive regional jobs growth and development and support key economic sectors in responding to the challenges of Brexit. Turning to apprenticeships and skills, these Estimates include a major funding package utilising the resources of the NTF to increase significantly workplace and employer-led training, boost apprenticeship numbers and help address Brexit-related issues. An additional €27 million is being made available for apprenticeships. It will support more than 7,000 new apprenticeship registrations in 2020 and a range of new apprenticeship programmes. By the end of 2020, more than 20,000 apprentices are expected to be in training. Upskilling is also being supported, with almost €8 million in additional funding for Skillnet Ireland and an additional €6 million for employee skills development initiatives. This will be particularly important in the context of a response to the changes arising in the labour market from the Covid-19 pandemic. I refer to the impact Covid-19 has had on the Vote so far this year. The pandemic has impacted all aspects of the education and skills sector, with schools, colleges and training facilities closing on 13 March. The junior certificate examinations did not proceed this year, while the leaving certificate examinations were postponed, with students offered the option of receiving calculated grades and the choice to take the exams at a later date when it is safe to do so. Education did not come to a halt, of course, with most schools and colleges making the transition to online learning, with significant support and input from parents. Great credit is due to everyone involved: teachers, school management, parents and the students. I appreciate that this transition may not have fully met the needs of every student, and I know that it was difficult for many, including those in exam years, those leaving primary school and students with additional needs.I should explain that the Revised Estimate presented today does not include any provision in relation to Covid-19 at this stage. Officials at the Department and I have been working with stakeholders on how to open schools safely. There will be costs associated with reopening. These costs will arise in relation to hand sanitation and other such cleaning and hygiene requirements but also in terms of teacher and SNA substitution and support for our school leaders. Officials are actively engaging with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to the financial support that will be necessary. I am also discussing the matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I recognise there is likely to be a need for additional funding to address these costs arising and it is my intention that the exceptional funding requirements of the education and skills sector for this year and other expenditure pressures will need to be addressed as part of the Supplementary Estimates process. This will allow a clear picture as to the scale of the investment needed in the sector to ensure that it is adequately funded to respond to the unprecedented challenges that currently exist in our schools and colleges. Some savings are likely to arise due to lower than anticipated expenditure in certain areas due to Covid-19 while additional and more substantial costs are likely to arise in areas relating to the reopening of schools and colleges. While costs associated with the State Examinations Commission will be lower due to the State examinations not going ahead as normal, the costs of the calculated grades have also to be factored in. In addition, there will be costs associated with running the exams at a later time. The capital allocation in the Vote is likely to be fully expended. While most construction projects were halted for a number of weeks, they have now resumed. Any capital expenditure savings arising from Covid-related delays will be required to alleviate budgetary pressures predating Covid-19. The departmental restructuring announced by the Taoiseach recently will result in the establishment of the Department of further and higher education, research, innovation and science. This will lead to a split of this Vote in due course, with two of its three programmes being allocated to the new Department, namely, skills development and higher education, together with the NTF and an element of central administration cost. These areas account for expenditure of some €2.9 billion of the funds provided for in this Estimate, including €2.3 billion in voted moneys. The tertiary education sector is going through a major transformation and will aim to build on the incredible base of scientific research which has developed in the past two decades and has played a central role in our economy and our ability to respond to the pandemic. I look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy Harris, in the months ahead on the establishment of the new Department and beyond. Functions will also be assigned to the new Department from other Departments with associated voted funds being allocated, while funding for educational welfare and school completion services will be assigned to the Department of Education and Skills from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The programme for Government agreed between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party sets out ambitious goals for all areas of the education sector. The commitments in the programme will be founded on the principles of excellence, inclusion and sustainability. The programme calls for additional investment in the sector. It seeks to address the cost of education, which is a barrier to participation. It seeks also to be more inclusive. Plurality and choice will continue to be expanded while the Irish language and culture will be actively encouraged and promoted. The importance of higher and further education and redress is emphasised. A key decision of the Taoiseach was to set up a new Department to oversee this sector. In the months ahead, I will be developing proposals to give effect to the commitments that are relevant to the Department of Education and Skills and such proposals will be costed in the normal manner with due regard to budgetary considerations. In conclusion, this Vote represents a record budget for the Department of Education and Skills of more than €11.2 billion. Of this allocation, some €10.13 billion represents the net Voted amount requiring the approval of the House. I thank the House for the opportunity to present this Revised Estimate and I look forward to engaging with the Deputies."	spk_251
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-16	dail	33	Estimates for Public Services 2020	dbsect_19	I thank the Deputies for their engagement and questions, some of which were repeated. I want to be absolutely unequivocal regarding the reopening of schools. My first engagement on appointment was meeting with a wide variety of valued stakeholders in education, including parents, teachers, students, managerial bodies, principals and deputy principals. Following those consultations, I was very pleased that there is an absolute collective agenda to reopen the schools fully in the next number of weeks, at the end of August or early September. That is a common and shared objective. There is no ambiguity, question mark or difficulty around that. It is a common agenda to reopen the schools fully and safely at the appropriate time, which is the end of August or start of September, depending on the norm. Questions have been raised about the return to school budget not being evident in these Estimates. This Revised Estimate relates to what was brought before the House late last year. There is most certainly going to be a further requirement relating to the Covid-19 reopening of schools. I am very conscious of that. Previous speakers highlighted some of the issues that would be addressed in a budget of that nature, such as personal protective equipment, PPE, sanitisation, cleaning regimes, and so on. My Department and officials are currently working through that and we are in discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. All the necessary funding to make the opening of schools possible will be put in place and I assure Deputies that I will be returning to them with a fully itemised budget so they will know exactly where the money was spent and how. For me to come in at this stage, when schools have not yet reopened, would be short-sighted and would not allow me to present Deputies with a full picture, as is my obligation to them. I assure Deputies that the budget is currently being worked through, and engagement and discussion with the stakeholders who have particular issues and challenges to raise with me and my Department is ongoing. All those financial measures are being included, specifically-----	spk_256
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-16	dail	33	Estimates for Public Services 2020	dbsect_19	I anticipate that announcements on the reopening of schools will come at the end of this month. I imagine that the costs will be available at that time, though perhaps not all of them will be. It would be premature at this stage to put any figures before the House because discussions are still ongoing. I will highlight some of the points Deputies have made regarding the reopening of the schools, such as substitution, for example. I recognise that there will be a requirement for substitution to be put in place and that the Department will be footing a bill of that nature.There was also an issue regarding vulnerable students and how we will cater for them. I am very conscious of children with particular needs as I come from that environment and they will also be catered for in this reopening of schools. Well-being will be a major issue for many children in future but also for the entire school community, and resources in respect of resilience and mental well-being will also be put in place. There is no confusion. There is a clear agenda to reopen schools fully come late August and early September and the necessary resources will absolutely be put in place to make that happen. Issues were also raised regarding the voluntary contribution. I acknowledge that parents and guardians are under particular stresses regarding voluntary contributions, perhaps now more so than ever. Regarding that issue, in the budget there is a 2.5% increase in capitation fees, and that is on top of the 5% increase from last year. I acknowledge that does not bring us to the pre-2011 level, but it is a recognition of and commitment to the need to put in place resources that will ensure less of a financial burden is being placed on parents. That will be a continuous objective in future.	spk_258
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-16	dail	33	Estimates for Public Services 2020	dbsect_19	That is fine. I have just one or two other points regarding other issues that were raised. Regarding children with particular needs, I highlight that continuing support is being provided to 890 DEIS schools, catering for more than 180,000 students, and to the school meals programme, etc. All of those resources will be put in place. The ability of students to engage in the education system is an absolute priority. An equal priority is that everyone involved in the school community will have an opportunity to return to school safely at the end of August and early September.	spk_260
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-16	dail	33	Estimates for Public Services 2020	dbsect_19	I thank the Deputy for his good wishes. I agree with him that the classroom, and indeed all of our world, will be a very different place now than it was prior to the arrival of Covid-19. Regarding the issue of the pupil-teacher ratio, there is a clear acknowledgement in the programme for Government on that issue. In respect of the future, however, it should be acknowledged that there has been improvement in schools with one to four teachers. There has been a points decrease that has improved the situation in those schools. In the broader picture that the Deputy mentioned concerning allocation, providing teachers and ensuring they get into schools, we are very active in that regard. There has been a very successful teacher supply panel. We are also looking at a mechanism of that nature in future. In addition, we are in discussions with key stakeholders regarding how we will cater for requirements that will be necessary for substitution and provision in schools. It will be catered for, because it is an issue within schools. If teachers are absent, or whatever the case may be, it will be necessary for them to be replaced. We are actively working on that issue through the teacher supply panel. I am very conscious of the issue of the requirement for extra space in schools. Many schools have on-campus facilities, such as halls, that can be utilised for extra space. In other instances, such spaces will not be available. We are looking at all avenues in areas in proximity to schools in order that these facilities can be utilised if the need arises.	spk_265
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-16	dail	33	Estimates for Public Services 2020	dbsect_19	I appreciate the comments and thank Deputy Berry for his good wishes. The Deputy asked about clarity around the reopening of the schools. I have no wish to repeat myself again. I want to make it clear that there is no ambiguity on this issue. Importantly, from my point of view, there should be full and frank engagement with all stakeholders. There are many constituents in education and they must be consulted and be part of the process. That is where we are at. There is a clear objective. The schools will reopen at the end of August or early September as per normal. The finer details and the challenges that may have to be ironed out are currently being ironed out. There is no ambiguity whatsoever in that regard. The guidelines for the reopening of schools have been issued to primary schools already. They are in the public domain. The schools are working through them. The guidelines at second level are currently being prepared. Reference was made to the budget and issues around the budget not being met. I wish to confirm unequivocally and make it 100% clear that any issues with regard to the reopening of schools in terms of costs are being covered and will be covered. The final figures will be brought before the House once again when they are available. There is no question in terms of the requirements, whether cleaning, provision of hand sanitiser or additional substitution or whatever. This will be fully resourced to allow the schools to fully reopen.	spk_270
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-16	dail	33	Estimates for Public Services 2020	dbsect_19	To Deputy Crowe, I say well done. He raised quite a number of schools in his locality and I appreciate that. I recognise that the demands in schools can be as individual as they can be universal. The Deputy specifically named individual schools and I assure him my officials will engage. I will revert to the Deputy in due course with an update on those schools. Equally, I appreciate the point that Deputy Murnane O'Connor raised in terms of emergency works. They are by their name emergency works. Occasionally, schools might not qualify because they are not deemed to be an emergency. Be that as it may, if the Deputy wants to bring the specific cases she raised to my attention, my officials will engage with her. On a point of information, and it has been raised by previous speakers, we have applied through the July stimulus for a minor works programme which, I believe, has the potential to be hugely significant going forward for schools. These will be works that will enable schools to carry out measures that will improve school buildings as we journey through Covid, but in the main will improve them in general as well. We are looking for that enhanced minor works grant. Current grant costs are approximately €30 million and we anticipate that we should be able to raise that to €50 million. That would be positive news for schools. We hope that will come next week. I reiterate that parents will not be footing the bill for the reopening of schools. There is absolute clarification on that. There are 890 DEIS schools serving 180,000 pupils. I appreciate that this is being reviewed since 2017. On the applications for new schools to come on board, I will revert to Deputy Murnane O'Connor on the specific ones she has mentioned. Specific guidelines have been issued in relation to school transport. We are currently working through those guidelines with Bus Éireann. We are confident that the school bus service will be available as normal for students to take up. The Deputy specifically raised face coverings and masks, etc. Children under 13 will not be required to wear them. It is advisable for those over 13, but the intricacies of it are currently being worked through. It is my intention that all of the information will be available and everything will be in the public domain as regards the return to school by the end of this month.	spk_283

I guarantee that my officials will revert to the Deputy on that. On St. Paul's secondary school, this is a matter for Dublin Bus. It is not a school transport issue.

I acknowledge once again that there has been complete buy-in from all of the stakeholders, including parents, teachers, students, managerial bodies and the entire school community to ensure that what is now an objective will be a reality at the end of August, early September, or whatever the normal time is for schools to reopen at.

It is a great achievement and one that we hope to roll out on a wider basis going forward. On the issue the Deputy raised of the release of the leaving certificate results, the next step is that students will re-engage with the portal regarding their desire to receive calculated grades. At that time also, the date for receipt of leaving certificate results will also be revealed. I acknowledge that this is very much a joined-up approach with third level colleges. Whatever announcements are made and arrangements put in place, this will be very much a joined-up approach and no student will be disadvantaged in any shape or form.	spk_300
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-14	dail	33	Credit Unions	dbsect_35	I thank Deputies Whitmore and Brady for raising this matter. It provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position regarding the accommodation needs of the North Wicklow Educate Together secondary school for this September. As the Deputies may be aware, the school was established in 2016 and has been accommodated since then, as the Deputies said, in a leased property on the Putland Road in Bray. The school opened with an enrolment of 36 pupils and numbers are growing incrementally, with an enrolment of 226 pupils in the 2019 to 2020 school year. I understand that the school expects an enrolment of 280 pupils for the 2020 to 2021 school year. My Department held a lease on the Putland Road property until 30 June last and has secured an extension to this lease until 31 October 2020. The school's patron is aware of this extension. The property is not available for long-term lease and the school requires alternative accommodation to facilitate its growth. In this regard, the Department has secured the agreement of the Religious Sisters of Charity to use the former St. Philomena's primary school, Ravenswell, Bray to accommodate North Wicklow Educate Together secondary school. The legal arrangements associated with the lease are being finalised by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the owner's legal representative, and that process is expected to be completed shortly. It is my Department's intention to have refurbishment works carried out in the building in advance of the school's occupation. In preparation for these works, various surveys were required to develop the scope of the work to be undertaken. This work was interrupted arising from Covid-19 and resumed when the restrictions were lifted. A licence agreement between my Department and the Religious Sisters of Charity is required to admit the building contractor on site to undertake the refurbishment works. The licence is being finalised by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the congregation's legal representative. This process is also expected to be completed shortly. My Department is anxious to ensure that the refurbishment works can be initiated in the building as soon as possible thereafter and will continue to keep the patron updated on progress. My Department's planning and building unit is working closely with the school authorities and patrons, including Educate Together, to ensure that contingency arrangements are in place where necessary if a school building project is not completed in time for the start of a new school year as a result of delays caused by Covid-19. I wish to clarify for the Deputies that my Department is continuing to prioritise this matter and will be liaising with the school's patron when a further update is available. I again thank the Deputies for giving me an opportunity to outline the position to the House and I assure them that the Department is concerned to ensure that the school's accommodation needs will most certainly be provided for.	spk_273

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-09	dail	33	Youth Services	dbsect_24	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. Before I address the specific issue raised, I would like to provide to the Members an outline of the extent of the school transport service. School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of my Department. In the 2019-20 school year, more than 120,000 children, including more than 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in more than 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering more than 100 million km at a cost of more than €219 million in 2019. The purpose of my Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children whose homes are remote from their nearest school. With regard to transport for the summer provision programme 2020, given the exceptional circumstances in planning for delivery of the programme and the shorter than normal timeframe in which to plan for school transport services, in addition to the expansion of the programme and coupled with the social distancing requirements as per health advice, the Department was not in a position to provide school transport for the programme this year. However, my Department will provide grant funding to support families with the cost of transport arrangements for those children who are eligible for school transport and who have been approved to participate in the summer programme. The grant payment is based on the distance that a family resides from their child's school of attendance. The calculation is based on four trips per day - home to school and school to home, morning and afternoon - multiplied by the number of days a child attends school for the programme. The current rate of grant is 39.12 cent per kilometre for the first 6,437 km travelled and 21.22 cent per kilometre for each kilometre travelled thereafter. Families who are already in receipt of the special transport grant for children with special educational needs will be paid as normal following the completion of the summer provision programme 2020. Families who currently avail of a transport service will be contacted by school transport section following the completion of the summer provision programme 2020 in regard to the arrangements for payment. Families who are not in a position to make their own transport arrangements in order to avail of the school-based programme may contact the special education section of my Department with a view to inquiring about the home-based programme. I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for affording me the opportunity to provide an outline of the extent of the school transport scheme and to respond to the specific issue raised.	spk_205

There was considerable difficulty in getting it on stream given that the announcement was made on 12 June. Schools were notified on 15 June and it began operation on 29 June. From that point of view, there was a difficulty in putting transport in place. I accept that the Deputy said that in her specific case, this transport seems to be in place.

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-09	dail	33	Youth Services	dbsect_24	I again thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Scoil Chrónáin is an existing all-Irish co-educational primary school, under the patronage of the Archbishop of Dublin and centrally located in the village of Rathcoole. A building project to provide a new 16-classroom school plus a two-classroom special educational needs unit for the school is included in my Department's school building programme. The new building will be provided on a site adjacent to its existing site in Rathcoole, County Dublin.This site is being acquired by my Department from South Dublin County Council. Rathcoole Educate Together national school is a new English medium primary school being established in 2020 under the patronage of Educate Together. This new school will be an English medium, co-educational,16-classroom school, plus a two-classroom special educational needs unit. It will be located in a Department-owned site at Coolamber Drive, Rathcoole, County Dublin. Access to this site will require the construction of a new road which is currently being planned by South Dublin County Council. As the Coolamber site is not currently accessible and as the Department now has access to the land adjacent to Scoil Chrónáin, it was determined that the interim accommodation for Rathcoole Educate Together national school could be provided temporarily on that site. The Department wrote to the board of management of Scoil Chrónáin on 19 March 2020 with regard to the proposed construction of a permanent school building for the school and outlining the Department's plans in this regard. The letter outlined that the Department was in the process of acquiring an additional site area adjacent to their existing site for this purpose. Scoil Chrónáin was informed of my Department's intention to commence the architectural planning process for the construction of its new school building. The Department also outlined that in tandem with this it would also initiate the architectural planning process for the construction of the new primary school, Rathcoole Educate Together national school. The letter outlined that the building projects for both schools would be advanced in parallel. The letter further outlined the need for my Department to provide interim accommodation to facilitate the new start-up school accommodation for Rathcoole Educate Together national school and that this interim accommodation was intended to be temporarily placed on the additional site area being acquired for Scoil Chrónáin. It outlined the process which was to take place, including lodging a planning application for the interim accommodation for Rathcoole Educate Together national school and also advised that the Department plans to move this temporary accommodation for the new school to its Coolamber Drive site as soon as site access is secured and in order to facilitate the construction of the permanent building for Scoil Chrónáin. My Department had also intended to arrange a meeting with Scoil Chrónáin to explain these matters in more detail but then the Covid situation occurred which has prevented this meeting taking place to date. Now that the country is reopening for business, my officials will be in contact with Scoil Chrónáin to arrange that meeting shortly. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.	spk_209

Firhouse Educate Together secondary school opened in September 2018 in vacant classrooms in the permanent school building of Firhouse Educate Together primary school on an education campus shared with the permanent 16-classroom school for Gaelscoil na Giúise. In September 2019, the Department put in place arrangements with Gaelscoil na Giúise and its patron body, An Foras Pátrúnachta, to use some vacant classrooms in the Gaelscoil for Firhouse ETSS. The Gaelscoil and its patron body, An Foras Pátrúnachta, has informed the Department that, due to additional accommodation requirements in the Gaelscoil, it is not possible for the secondary school to continue to operate in that building for the coming school year. The Department is in regular communication with the school's patron body, Educate Together, on this and other accommodation matters, and the patron body keeps its school communities updated on an ongoing basis on such matters. In December 2019, having considered various proposals by Educate Together in the local area which were deemed either unsuitable or unavailable, the Department advised the patron body of the proposed accommodation at the Citywest education campus. The proposed building at Citywest is State owned and within the Department's control. It has provided high-quality, fully serviced, permanently constructed accommodation for two other primary schools up until last September. There are currently more than 30 permanent classrooms, full staff facilities, ancillary rooms and an external play area available for occupation before the start of the 2020 school year. The accommodation will also serve two new schools opening in the Citywest area this September. While this accommodation is in the school catchment area adjacent to the Firhouse-Oldbawn catchment area, it offers the possibility of ready-made permanent and cost-effective accommodation on an interim basis for Firhouse Educate Together secondary school. The Department offered the school's management and patron body an opportunity to view the accommodation in December last and remains committed to working with and supporting the school to minimise insofar as possible any impact this temporary move may have. The Department has informed the school that appropriate transport will be facilitated from Firhouse to the interim accommodation at Citywest while the school is in Citywest. In December, the Department authorised Educate Together to explore the possibility of providing temporary accommodation on a site in Stocking Lane in Firhouse. A proposal submitted to the Department in April was priced at an estimated €3.6 million and requires a planning application with all the time and risk that entails. However, it was never a realistic proposition that such accommodation would be available in time for the start of the coming school year. In April 2020, the Department completed the acquisition of the permanent site for Firhouse Educate Together secondary school at Ballycullen Green, Oldcourt Road, Dublin 24 and is currently progressing the project for the permanent accommodation as part of its fast-track design-and-build programme. The first key step in this process has been reached with the acquisition of the site. The next key step is securing planning permission. Once planning permission is secured this will open up the possibility of providing temporary accommodation on this site at the earliest opportunity. However, it will not be possible to have this accommodation in place for September 2020. The facility in Citywest currently offers the greatest level of certainty with regard to the provision of ready-to-occupy, high-quality accommodation for Firhouse Educate Together secondary school on an interim basis for the 2020-21 school year, pending its return to Firhouse when suitable accommodation becomes available there. With regard to the possibility of Firhouse Educate Together secondary school staying in the accommodation in Gaelscoil na Giúise, the Department remains in ongoing communication with the patron bodies concerned regarding all options.

The facility in Citywest currently offers the greatest level of certainty with regard to the provision of ready-to-occupy, high-quality accommodation for Firhouse Educate Together secondary school on an interim basis for the 2020-21 school year, pending its return to Firhouse when suitable accommodation becomes available there. With regard to the possibility of Firhouse Educate Together secondary school staying in the accommodation in Gaelscoil na Giúise, the Department remains in ongoing communication with the patron bodies concerned regarding all options. I thank the Deputies for raising the matter.	spk_273
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-07	dail	33	School Accommodation	dbsect_19	I have listened to the Deputies and heard what they have said. I appreciate there is unanimity among the Deputies from the area on this issue. The Deputies have raised points from the perspectives of parents and children and I have heard what they have said. All I can say at this point is that my officials in the Department will continue to have ongoing communication with the patron bodies concerned and all options will be examined.	spk_280
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-07-07	dail	33	Special Educational Needs	dbsect_20	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Before I address the specific issue, I would like to provide the Members of the House with an outline on the extent of the school transport service. School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. In the 2019-2020 school year, more than 120,000 children, including 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering over 100 million km at a cost of more than €219 million in 2019. The purpose of my Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from the school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. With regard to transport for the summer provision programme 2020, given the exceptional circumstances in planning for delivery of the programme and the shorter than normal timeframe in which to plan the school transport services, in addition to the expansion of the programme and coupled with the social distancing requirements as per health advice, the Department, unfortunately, was not in a position to provide school transport for the programme this year. However, my Department will provide grant funding to support families with the cost of transport arrangements for those children who are eligible for school transport and have been approved to participate in the summer programme. The grant payment is based on the distance that a family resides from their child's school of attendance. The calculation is based on four trips per day - home to school and school to home, morning and afternoon - multiplied by the number of days a child attends school for that programme. The current rate of grant is 39.12 cent per kilometre for the first 6,437 km travelled and 21.22 cent per kilometre for each kilometre travelled thereafter. Families who are already in receipt of the special transport grant for children with special educational needs will be paid as normal following completion of the summer provision programme 2020. Families who currently avail of a transport service will be contacted by the school transport section following the completion of the summer provision programme 2020 in regard to the arrangements for payment. Families who are not in a position to make their own transport arrangements in order to avail of a school-based programme have the option of contacting the special education section of my Department with a view perhaps to inquiring about the home-based programme. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, affording me the opportunity to provide an outline of the extent of the school transport scheme and to respond to the issue raised.	spk_282

Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-06-27	dail	33	Nomination of Taoiseach (Resumed)	dbsect_4	"Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht an t-am agus an deis seo a thabhairt dom. Rachaidh mé gan mhoill chuig obair thábhactach an lae. Tairgim:Go n-ainmneoidh Dáil Éireann an Teachta Micheál Martin chun a cheaptha ag an Uachtarán mar Thaoiseach.I move:That Dáil Éireann nominate Deputy Micheál Martin for appointment by the President to be Taoiseach. ""Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast."" When the great playwright, William Shakespeare, composed these lines some 400 years ago, I imagine he never envisaged the 160 Deputies of the 33rd Dáil taking his advice quite so much to heart, but here we are. It will soon be five months since each one of us was given a mandate to serve as a Member of Dáil Éireann. When we first met on 20 February, the unprecedented diversity of this Dáil meant that we were unable to elect a Taoiseach. Soon afterwards, our country began and continues to feel the impact of a global pandemic of a scale and magnitude that has not been seen for over 100 years. These have been difficult months, during which every part of our society has experienced an unprecedented strain. The priority has, quite rightly, been on trying to bring the pandemic under control and to limit its impact. Exceptional efforts have also been undertaken to make sure that we have continued to have a functioning Government and Parliament. However, the constitutional and political imperative to form a new Government after a general election has always remained. The Fianna Fáil Party has worked within its mandate to engage with others, first on core principles and then on the much harder work of agreeing a detailed programme for Government.We have also engaged with a range of non-party Deputies. The resultant programme for Government sets out a clear roadmap for recovery and renewal in our country. It commits to an investment-led recovery and urgent, proactive action. On housing, health, education, the historic challenge of tackling climate change, and many other areas, it is a comprehensive plan that, without doubt, involves compromise, but at its very core it is true to the democratic mandates we all received on 8 February last. Without question, there have been trying and testing days in recent months but, as always, a hard beginning maketh a good ending. And so it followed yesterday that the memberships of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party voted overwhelmingly and unequivocally to ratify the programme for Government. It is now my very great honour to begin our work together by proposing that Dáil Éireann nominate Deputy Micheál Martin for appointment by Uachtarán na hÉireann to the office of Taoiseach. If one looks through the record of the Dáil, one will find that the debate and nomination of Taoiseach has often been full of angry, partisan speeches. The debate in 1959 when Seán Lemass, our most transformative Taoiseach, was nominated was just such an occasion. In the midst of all, however, Deputy Noël Browne showed a very different and positive side of politics. Without in any way minimising the differences he had with Lemass on policy, Browne said that if one looked back on his ministerial record, one ""must give credit to the man"". That is the case today. When one looks at the record of Deputy Micheál Martin, one must give credit to the man. By every fair measure he has used his time in high office to deliver vital and sustained progress for the people. He was, without question, a reforming and progressive Minister for Education and Science. He created the first ever programme of support for children with autism and support for special needs in mainstream education. He created the National Educational Psychological Service, the core of the DEIS programme for disadvantaged schools, and many other initiatives. The rapid expansion of multidenominational schools and Gaelscoileanna was begun by him and he implemented the only reform to the primary school curriculum in the past 50 years. In fact, in every part of our education system, Deputy Micheál Martin has left both a lasting and a positive legacy. As Minister for Health and Children, he faced down many challenges to deliver policies that have, according to every independent study, saved tens of thousands of lives. As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, he continued his radical work in developing the research capacity of our country and reorientating inward investment towards industries that could compete and thrive in the new economy. These are the very sectors that have survived and supported public finances in the face of, first, a global recession and then a global pandemic. At the Department of Foreign Affairs, he led successful negotiations both in Europe and with all parties in Northern Ireland. Internationally, he pushed forward Ireland's work on nuclear non-proliferation and placed Ireland at the centre of the push for action on humanitarian issues such as the Gaza blockade. For those who see politics only from a cynical or competitive perspective, nothing will ever persuade them, but so be it. As Theodore Roosevelt reminds us, it is not the critic who counts. Deputy Micheál Martin has a proud record of valiantly delivering for the people of this free Republic. Many of the loudest and most angry voices, who fill our debates with attacks on the right of the majority in this democratically elected Parliament to form a Government, will no doubt once again make partisan and perhaps personal comments, but we will not be deterred. The programme for Government agreed by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party is a positive programme of change.It is a progressive programme of change. It is a proactive programme of change. Deputy Micheál Martin has the record, talent and tenacity we need to lead this new Government and to serve all the people of our country with distinction in the office of Taoiseach. Arís, a Cheann Comhairle, tairgim go n-ainmneoidh Dáil Éireann an Teachta Micheál Martin chun a cheapadh ag an Uachtarán mar Thaoiseach."	spk_3
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-05-13	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education and Skills): Statements	dbsect_7	"Is aoibhinn beatha an scoláire, a deir an dán. Is é sin mar a bhí, b'fhéidir, ach ní mar sin atá anois, in aon chor. ""Aoibhinn Beatha an Scoláire"", an often-quoted 17th century poem, suggests that the life of a student is beautiful and idyllic. It has now changed irrevocably. The suite of changes recently announced by the Department is seismic in nature and unquantifiable in its magnitude and future impact on the education system. I profoundly regret that the plan B option of hosting the traditional leaving certificate did not come to pass. Although it is flawed in a few respects, there is an essential fairness and equity at the core of the leaving certificate that is unmatched in any other type of exam. It is independent and anonymous. Chief among its many advantages is that it is immune to perceived manipulation. It is of enormous disappointment to me that until the clarification provided by the Minister today, there had been no quantifiable and verifiable evidence of a concerted effort by the Department to implement plan B. The proposal to hand is a leaving certificate adjudicated on the basis of calculated grades. I acknowledge the co-operation of all stakeholders who are working with the Minister to make this a reality. I refer in particular to teachers, many of whom have principled objections to assessment on the basis of calculated grades but who, in recognition of these extraordinary times, have agreed to implement this extraordinary measure. I hope the Minister and the Department will be mindful and demonstrably appreciative of that co-operation in the months and years ahead. There are myriad questions I wish to pose but time does not allow. I have submitted many of them as parliamentary questions. I ask the Minister to confirm his commitment to indemnify all teachers as they embark on the calculated grades process. I ask that he commit to reinstating the 100% grade he previously offered for aspects of the Irish, foreign language and music exams and extend that to practicals, projects and course work. How does he propose to accommodate students who take a subject outside of school, as referred to by Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan? What is the status of students who plan to sit the written exams, possibly in 2021? Will they have to engage with schools in that regard? I ask the Minister to give details on the newly commissioned special unit of the Department which will have oversight of the calculated grades. On the reopening of schools, will he commit to additional staff allocation and increased accommodation for all schools? To be parochial, I will conclude on an issue in my constituency. I ask the Minister to commit to the provision of transport for 19 students in Annascaul, County Kerry, who require transport to their preferred local school. I have written to the Minister and the Minister of State on the issue. Is aoibhinn beatha an scoláire. Is é sin mar a bhí, ach ní mar sin atá anois. B'fhéidir go mbeidh arís, má éiríonn linn go léir an dúshlán nua a shárú. Gabhaim buíochas."	spk_40
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-05-06	dail	33	Covid-19 (Tourism): Statements	dbsect_5	Many facts, statistics and truths regarding the Irish tourism industry will be disclosed in this Chamber this afternoon. To my mind, however, the most important truth, dare I say it, is that County Kerry is the jewel in the crown of the Irish tourism industry, hosting 2.2 million overseas and Irish visitors every year. Last year alone, tourism was worth some €661 million to Kerry and supported one in five of our workforce and their families. Now, all our hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfast accommodation, bus operators, restaurants, pubs and visitor facilities are in lockdown. Covid-19 has forced 82% of the hospitality workforce into unemployment.Tourism supply and support businesses have also been severely affected, with thousands of employees out of work and companies struggling simply to survive. The hit to Kerry is likely to be in the order of between €300 million and €400 million and will impact on every town, village and local community in my home county. We now have a provisional timetable for the reopening of the tourism sector, but if tourism is to survive and ultimately thrive post-Covid-19, it needs much more than just a timetable. In that regard, I ask the Minister for State to consider and address the following points. Why have seasonal workers, so vital to the tourism industry, been excluded from the Covid-19 payment? Will the Department insist on a VAT rate of 0% for a two-year period with immediate effect, followed by a scaled increase to a maximum of 9%? Will the Minister of State commit to rate relief for six or nine months, with a further commitment to fund local authorities for revenues lost? Will he consider a revision of the criteria for local enterprise office, LEO, support mechanisms to facilitate employment grants for the tourism sector? Will he also consider a rebate on insurance premiums for the periods that businesses are closed? Will he consider a business reactivation fund to support businesses in reopening? We require a fair and equitable reopening schedule for restaurants, public houses and other facilities so that no single sector is disadvantaged by virtue of the timetable. I also suggest an extension of the wage subsidy scheme for a further six to 12 months. Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá maidir leis na coláistí Gaeilge shamhraidh. Is gné fhíorthábhachtach iad den tionscal turasóireachta. Mar is eol don Aire, ní bheidh dalta ar bith i nGaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne, nó aon Ghaeltacht eile, an samhradh seo. De bharr sin, ní bheidh aon airgead á dhéanamh ag an eacnamaíocht áitiúil, ag na mná tí, agus mar sin de. Caithfear roinnt mhaith tacaíochtaí a chur ar bun chun cinntiú go mairfidh na coláistí agus an eacnamaíocht áitiúil sna blianta atá amach romhainn. Tá an t-am caite, so fágfaidh mé aige sin é.	spk_55
Norma Foley	48	Unknown	Kerry	#NormaFoley	2020-02-20	dail	33	Nomination of Taoiseach	dbsect_10	Gabhaim buíochas agus comhghairdeas leis an gCeann Comhairle as a bheith tofa arís. John B. Keane, the late, great Kerry playwright, once remarked that to be of Kerry is both a gift and an awesome responsibility. To be a first-time Deputy from the kingdom of Kerry addressing this august Chamber on the opening day of the Thirty-third Dáil is also a gift and a responsibility, one that is humbling and daunting in equal measure. Gabhaim buíochas arís leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht an t-am agus an deis seo a thabhairt dom. Anois rachaidh mé chuig obair thábhachtach an lae. Tairgim go n-ainmneoidh Dáil Éireann an Teachta Micheál Martin chun a cheaptha ag an Uachtarán mar Thaoiseach. I am new to this Chamber, but I recognise that the reality of the general election and the diverse nature of the House may mean that no Taoiseach will be elected today. No Deputy or leader can claim to speak on behalf of the will of the people. There are many mandates regarding the Government we should elect and the programme it should implement. However, this is an important moment for each Member to signal how we propose to use our mandate and how a new Government should be led. The objectives of Fianna Fáil are clear and its intentions are unambiguous. On its behalf, I am proud beyond measure to nominate Deputy Micheál Martin as Taoiseach. I do so mindful that he is determined to lead a Government which will not just talk about change but, rather, will deliver it. He will do so in a way which strengthens the social, economic, environmental and cultural pillars of our society.  The bard, William Shakespeare, sagely wrote: ... to thine own self be true,And it must follow, as the night the day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.In a lifetime distinguished by public service, Deputy Micheál Martin has always remained true to himself, his people and his roots. Growing up in a working class family in Cork, he learned the core values of community, commitment, integrity and decency. His democratic republicanism and his belief in the duty of politics to serve all sections of our society have defined his time in office. If one looks fairly at his record, one will see that he has already achieved far more positive change than his loudest critics could ever hope to match. By any fair measure, he was a radically reforming and progressive Minister for Education and Science. In the area of special needs, he created the first programme of support for children with autism and, indeed, support for special needs in mainstream education. All Members are familiar with the need for additional child care assistants and educational psychologists. Before Deputy Martin was Minister for Education and Science, those services did not exist and, to our collective shame, children with special needs were often excluded in our schools. Never afraid to take a bold step, Deputy Martin began the expansion of the number of multi-denominational schools and gaelscoileanna by overturning 80 years of practice and entitling them to full funding for sites and building work. It is worth noting that he implemented the only reform to the primary school curriculum in the past 50 years. A series of initiatives he developed and implemented to tackle educational disadvantage led to the highest school completion rate in our history, a new era in expanding third level education and a dramatic increase in apprenticeships. His radical changes to public health policy and the development of public cancer and cardiac services while Minister for Health and Children have saved tens of thousands of lives. As a result of his reforms, waiting lists for public patients in the health system were significantly lower than is currently the case, and falling further. This was all done within budget. As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, he continued his radical work in developing the research capacity of our country and secured investment which has provided the foundation for industries which now employ tens of thousands of people. Of course, as Minister for Foreign Affairs he successfully led negotiations in Europe and with all parties in Northern Ireland. A hallmark of that work was his steady support, away from the cameras and set-piece meetings, for investing in concrete cross-Border projects and his reaching out to marginalised communities. Internationally, he pushed forwards Ireland's work on non-proliferation and in 2010 was the first foreign minister to bypass the blockade on Gaza and visit it to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis there. The policies he has put forward as our priorities involve a mix of urgent action and longer-term reform to address the social, economic, environmental and cultural challenges facing our country. They represent a positive and progressive agenda, a people's agenda. All too often, Irish politics is highly personal and refuses to acknowledge the strengths of individuals. Time and again, Deputy Micheál Martin has shown a deep personal commitment to delivering important progress for this country. It is said that leadership is an action, not a position.In his deeds and actions throughout his political career, Deputy Micheál Martin has shown himself to be a constructive, inclusive and effective leader. I have no doubt that he will serve all the people of the country we love with integrity, insightfulness, nobility and decency in the office of Taoiseach. Arís, tairgím go n-aimneoidh Dáil Éireann an Teachta Martin chun a cheapadh ag an Uachtarán mar Thaoiseach.	spk_28
