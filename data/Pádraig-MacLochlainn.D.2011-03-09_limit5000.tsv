Padraig Mac Lochlainn	51	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2024-02-15	dail	33	Sustainable Fisheries Sector and Coastal Communities: Statements, Questions and Answers	dbsect_30	I note that the Government had provided 15 minutes for its own Members to participate in this and nobody has taken up one single minute of those 15. That speaks volumes about the priority the Government is giving to the profound crisis in our fishing and seafood industry. Looking across our coast, I do not know to whom the Government is talking because I speak to inshore fishermen, islands fishermen, offshore fishermen, the seafood industry and the aquaculture industry and there is profound concern across the industry. A fisherman in recent days said to me that if the decommissioning scheme were made available again, he believes that even more would avail of it because they just cannot see light at the end of the tunnel and they do not see a sense of urgency in our Government at all. The Minister will know that there is serious and profound concern about the negotiations that are happening as we speak between the European Commission and Iceland. Iceland is a country with a population of 380,000 people. I think that is around the same population as that of the city of Cork. If what has been suggested goes ahead, Iceland would have almost equal access to blue whiting as our entire industry and, of course, our population is 5.2 million in this State, 7 million on the island. These are our waters. This is our exclusive economic zone. Iceland is not a member of the European Union. I do not have much time and I ask that the Minister respond as quickly as he can. When did he become aware of the discussions between the European Commission and Iceland? What was the exact date?	spk_323

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	51	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2024-02-15	dail	33	Sustainable Fisheries Sector and Coastal Communities: Statements, Questions and Answers	dbsect_30	I will conclude on this because I only have four minutes left. I want to talk about inshore and island fishermen and the crisis they are facing. I will lead with this and ask that the Minister look at the issue of Brexit. It is clear that the European Commission agreed a Brexit deal with the UK accepting zonal attachment rather than relative stability. In other words, the waters would benefit those who live closer to them. That is the basis to the Brexit agreement - zonal attachment. Will the Minister examine the approach of the Irish Government in terms of the entire value? Will he give an assessment of the entire value of all the fish in the Irish exclusive economic zone, which is within the 200-mile limit? I am not asking the Minister to respond to that now, but he might undertake to supply those of us in the Opposition with a full value of all the fish in the exclusive economic zone of Ireland. What is the full value? What do we get? He might then address the zonal attachment issue. I do not want him to respond now as I do not have enough time left. I want to say this on the record. Representatives from the National Inshore Fishermen's Association appeared before the Oireachtas committee recently. If the Minister has not had a chance to do so, he should please look back at their presentation or at least read the transcript of it. It was harrowing. As he knows, there are almost 2,000 inshore fishermen across the State. They have a producer organisation, which is good news. We also have the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, IIMRO. However, both of them are getting very limited support in terms of their producer organisation. They are really trying to stand up for their communities with very limited resources. Will the Minister look at that? Will the Minister look at the issue of fuel subsidies? The fuel subsidy is nothing. He talks about the tie-up scheme. Inshore and islands could not avail of that. They had no financial support deal, and the cost of fuel is increasing again. He might address supports and financial supports for the producer organisations. The Minister knows about the collapse of the crab and shrimp markets. Can he provide financial supports for that? The Minister has spoken about piers and harbours. Investment in piers and harbours came from the Brexit adjustment reserve fund. European money, which is basically called redundancy money in the industry, was given to make up for the huge loss of income to our industry. That money is being invested in piers and harbours. I would argue that it should be central Exchequer capital funding. Certainly, a good proportion of it should be going towards that. The Government has spent tens of millions of this Brexit adjustment reserve fund money on piers and harbours. Why has it not given financial assistance directly on fuel, as requested, compensating for the collapse of crab and shrimp and the issue of supporting the producer organisations? Finally, because the Minister will only have about one minute to respond to me, I will mention the area of aquaculture. The Minister will know that in a recent speech in this Chamber, I spoke about the impact of recent changes in aquaculture in terms of Brexit. There are new export requirements for the live bivalve mollusc. Costs, logistics, paperwork and bureaucracy have all increased. I ask the Minister to engage with the IFA's aquaculture committee on this issue because this is having a serious impact on its members. I ask him to pay attention to that issue, too.	spk_331

Today, some of its leaders are in Brussels speaking for our industry. It is absolutely critical at this stage that the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, who is in the Chamber, appear before the Dáil to make a statement on how this matter is being handled and that we have statements about the overall state of the industry. Inshore fishermen were here last week. Aquaculture, both offshore and inshore, is an industry in serious crisis. We need an urgent statement from the Minister setting out his vision and approach to negotiations in Europe to reassure the industry that it has a future.	spk_30
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	51	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2024-01-30	dail	33	Services for those Seeking Protection in Ireland: Statements	dbsect_9	I am sorry to report back to the Minister and her colleagues that the experience I have seen in Donegal and across the country of how the Government has handled the challenge of refugees and asylum seekers has been nothing short of shambolic. I give the example of a national school in my constituency. I still find it utterly shocking how the situation was handled. Sessiaghoneill National School saw an increase in pupil numbers in October 2022 of 52. The numbers rose from approximately 152 to 204, which was a substantial increase of one third. The new pupils were the children of refugees and asylum seekers. The school was welcoming, with wonderful support given to the children. I am glad to say they flourished in that environment. However, because the children were not enrolled before the deadline of 30 September, they received no financial support. The school staff were repeatedly in contact with the Department of Education asking for the same support  When I look across Donegal, I see there are now more than 7,000 Ukrainian refugees and almost 2,000 asylum seekers accommodated in the county. In most instances, that has been done with the support of the community. People's goodwill was thrown back in their faces. There has been an impact on tourism, with half of hotel beds in the county now taken up in accommodating people. In a county that has economically struggled, opportunistic investors are securing buildings, some their own and some from others, and providing those buildings to the Department. I do not blame the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, for this. He was abandoned by the rest of the Cabinet and left on his own to deal with the problem. There was no co-ordinated approach with housing, health, education, social services and so on. None of that happened. It was all left to the Minister and his officials. They were put in crisis mode looking to find buildings. It was a complete disservice. Donegal has taken more refugees and asylum seekers  The Government must accept that its handling of this issue has been shambolic.It has abandoned the Minister, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, to try to handle it all on his own. Now there is clear anger all across the country, whereby people who do not have not a racist bone in their bodies and who say they responded to the original crisis in Ukraine are now asking questions again and again. A small minority of our people are racist and they are taking advantage of this but the Government's handling of this in communities is playing into their hands. Please listen to people like me who have stood up for the underprivileged and disadvantaged all my political life. I do not have a racist bone in my body. I am an internationalist person. I am telling the Government that this is being handled appallingly. Good people have been burnt badly by all of this experience. The Government needs to rebuild those relationships, listen to the people and make changes now	spk_156
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	51	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2024-01-25	dail	33	United Kingdom Import Controls: Statements	dbsect_31	The Minister will not be surprised that I am going to concentrate today on the impact of Brexit on the Irish fishing, seafood and aquaculture industries and indeed the import and export of seafood into and out of Ireland. It was well flagged in advance that the Irish fishing and seafood industry was going to be the big casualty of Great Britain’s decision to leave the EU - the big casualty or as Irish fishermen know all too well, the sacrificial lamb. It involved a 15% quota cut, 39 fishing vessels lost forever to the Irish fleet and a loss of at least €43 million every year. It has been a disaster. The worst part is that it is still rolling and rolling. The National Inshore Fishermen’s Association appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine yesterday pleading for support in the face of collapsing markets and no safety net support funding. This inshore industry is also suffering extinction by a thousand cuts. Add into that the news we received just this morning about new animal health certification requirements for live aquaculture animals transiting the British land bridge and we really are in the middle of the perfect storm. Let us get to the specific topic of today’s statements, namely, import controls on goods and services from Great Britain. I will also speak about export controls. On Monday, 2 October 2023, five fish processors imported fish in one lorry consignment into Belfast via Cairnryan as they had done for 20 years. Clearance was provided in writing for this haulier to exit the port and proceed on his way to deliver the fish. Later that evening, a trade in animals and related products, TARP, notice issued from Belfast City Council to recall the goods. At this stage, some of the goods were already in transit to Europe. The following Friday, 6 October, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland contacted the customers to say that a food recall notice was issued. This was extended to a European-wide recall notice. Despite contacting the Minister's office, the Department, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to try and understand what happened, the shutters were pulled down. Authorities were also contacted in the North. To this day, we, the haulage company, the processors, the purchasers and the retailers still do not know what happened that caused this awful scenario and completely avoidable mess. We asked that a report on exactly what happened in this situation be completed and published to prevent this ever happening again. We have also asked that a framework be published and understood by all stakeholders and authorities should such an occurrence happen in the future. Separately, we were made aware this morning of a potentially seriously damaging change for the aquaculture industry that will come in over a cliff edge on 31 January 2024. Full animal certification will now be required for all live aquatic animals transiting Great Britain. This will have considerable consequences for the aquaculture industry. As the appointed competent body responsible for these inspections, the Marine Institute must be contacted four days in advance and inspections must be carried out on site. The service provided to carry out inspections is Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. There is considerable concern that capacity does not exist within veterinary officials in the Department to be able to manage these additional requirements. This is another example of bad planning or lack of planning and failing to engage with those who know the industry as is the case in so many other fields when we talk about this Government. Yet again, there was no meeting with all the stakeholders at the table. What engagement did the Department have with British and EU officials in advance of these requirements to examine any kind of workaround or perhaps even a derogation for bivalve molluscs transiting through the British land bridge? Both of the examples that I have set out confirm the difficulties that Brexit has visited upon the Irish seafood industry. I am, therefore, asking for a direct written response from the Minister's office on both matters I raised today. I await those responses with interest.	spk_363

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	51	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2024-01-23	dail	33	Conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory: Motion	dbsect_9	"Some 24,500 people have been killed in Gaza, 70% of whom were women and children. More than 10,000 children have been murdered. Some 8,000 civilians are buried under the rubble, more than 60,000 have been injured, and 1.9 million or 85% of the population have been displaced. Half of the buildings, housing more than 2 million human beings, have been either damaged or destroyed over a period of months. People face starvation that is unprecedented in recent human history. How appropriate it was that South Africa took the case to the International Court of Justice and that a tremendous Irishwoman, Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, articulated the reason South Africa took that case. She spoke for the Irish people and those across the world who are devastated by these actions and feel powerless. It was incredibly powerful. If you talk to the activists who fought against the apartheid South African regime over the years, they will tell you the apartheid the Palestinian people have endured for all these years is much worse than what they endured. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and B'Tselem, one after the other and with expert analysis, have clearly demonstrated that Israel is an apartheid state.What do we have from the Irish Government? It is a muted response. I spoke in the Dáil when the Human Rights Watch report came out, when the Amnesty International report came out, and when the B'Tselem report came out. I repeatedly asked the Government if they agree that Israel is an apartheid state. I have yet to hear a spokesperson for the Irish Government say ""Yes we agree and we accept the findings of those human rights organisations"". They cannot even do that. Senator Frances Black is in the Chamber and is observing proceedings here. The Government could not support her Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018. Even though it was passed by both Houses, this Government could not implement it. We are talking here about saying we will not do trade with people who commit international war crimes, engage in ethnic cleansing and conduct illegal settlements. This Government could not even do that. It could not implement legislation that was passed by both Houses. The Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill 2023 proposed to stop the investment by any arm of the Irish State into those illegal settlements and was brought forward by my colleague Deputy John Brady. The Government could not even do that. When the Dáil and the Seanad voted to recognise the state of Palestine the Government could not implement that. At every step of the way the Government has failed the Palestinian people. It gives comfort to the people whom we have heard on our TV screens and who were just quoted by a Minister. Because they have been allowed to get away with apartheid, with oppression, with ethnic cleansing, and with everything that they have done to the Palestinian people, of course they believe they will get away with this too because we have been completely impotent. When I say ""we"", I mean our Government because our people certainly do not share that. For years whenever the international community has talked about the two-state solution there has been confirmation from Netanyahu of his absolute rejection of that. There is no basis to hide behind some sort of international consensus. There is no basis anymore. This is a failed policy from our Government. Let us be absolutely clear about it. On 18 July 1984 a Dunnes Stores shop worker, Mary Manning, refused to handle South African goods. That created a huge momentum and the Irish people rose up. A few years later the Irish Government got behind their people, brought in sanctions and confronted the apartheid regime. The Irish Government back then responded to the anger of our people and led the way. Why is it that our Governments again and again fail us with weakness? Even now in the face of unparalleled and unrivalled outrage they still fail to stand with our people. Tonight and tomorrow night the Government will refuse to accept amendments that are about basic decency and about standing on the side of righteousness, on the side of what is right, and on the side of the case taken by South Africa. The Government knows that it should associate itself with that case. It knows it should have done that: many countries did and those countries are on the right side of history. Our Government - not our Irish people - again and again are on the wrong side of this. The Government is too weak and is letting down our people again and again."	spk_227

The engagement with the representative organisations is welcome. The Minister and I are both from coastal communities. We are from Inishowen. We are surrounded by mostly inshore fishermen. They were not organised in the past. Now they are organised and speaking for themselves. It would be an important acknowledgment to try to demonstrate that uniting together, organising and having a plan can deliver results for the sector. As I said, whatever can be done, I urge that it be done to get an immediate settling and just to keep the roofs over their heads for now. Then we will try to build it from there.	spk_71

Patients were in the back of those ambulances rather than being cared for in the hospital. This is not a rare occurrence. A week previously a similar number of ambulances were outside and I am sure the Minister will agree that this is utterly unacceptable. I received a report late last night that an 88 year old woman had been on a hard seat all day long, waiting for care, as had a 79 year old man. Recently the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, came up to Donegal and met with GPs and consultants who had been seeking such a meeting for weeks. When will he act on the proposals they made which are crucial to the hospital?	spk_172

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	50	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2023-11-21	dail	33	Health Service Recruitment Freeze: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_15	The Minister will be in Letterkenny on Friday, and he will meet the representatives of the GPs and consultants who have expressed grave concern about the major acute hospital in the country. This is an important meeting. I urge the Minister to listen to what the representatives have to say and to understand that what lies at the heart of the crisis in our hospital is years of systematic underfunding. In a recent letter to the Minister from almost 30 consultants in Letterkenny University Hospital, it was estimated that the underinvestment right now amounts to €45 million. That is about 25% less than what the hospital should have. It also means that we do not have the number of consultants, junior doctors, nurses and beds right across the spectrum. It is absolutely unthinkable that with all of that said and the challenges the Minister is going to face on Friday, he would have a freeze on recruitment not just in Letterkenny University Hospital, but anywhere in the health services across Donegal. As the Minister well knows, if there is a recruitment freeze in community hospitals and community care, all of that has a knock-on impact in the crisis at the emergency department. I urge the Minister to act on the issues that the representatives raise, to have a plan whereby the senior management of Letterkenny hospital and the Saolta hospital group meet the GP and consultant representatives, the TDs and the councillors in the HSE forum on a regular basis, giving us updates and actions. Fundamentally, the Minister needs to accept that it is an absolute and incontrovertible fact that there clearly has been systematic underfunding and neglect of the hospital compared with other hospitals and to turn that around and address issues raised here. The Government cannot defund the health service and have a recruitment freeze at a time of crisis but my God, it cannot do it in Donegal.	spk_178

I met a large delegation in my constituency recently and was taken aback by the way they had been unfairly treated. It reminds me of the treatment of school secretaries and caretakers for many years in the context of pay and conditions. The other issue is that they are not paid for 69 days of the year when there are school holidays or breaks. There are big issues when they have to sign on. What is happening is incredibly disrespectful. These people clearly do not do it for the money. They assist young people with special needs and disabilities. They are an important part of these children's and young people's lives. I ask that the Government urgently review the situation and give them fair treatment, pay and conditions.	spk_84

On 18 July 1984 Mary Manning, a shop worker at Dunnes Stores on Henry Street, here in Dublin, refused to handle South African goods in protest against its apartheid regime. Three years later Ireland became the first state in the western world to ban imports of South African goods. That is the stand we took back then. We led the way and the rest of the world continued on that path, and eventually that apartheid regime was brought down and justice was delivered for all the South African people. Despite the fact that the occupied territories Bill was passed by both Houses, it was not implemented. Despite the fact that my colleague, Deputy Brady, brought forward the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill, it was not accepted or implemented. At some point we have to go back to the approach we took during the South African challenge from people who upheld humanity and decency across the world, starting with that woman, Mary Manning, and all her colleagues who joined her. The appeal, therefore, is to go back to the practices we had in the past that were the right ones to make a stand for what is right and decent. All the Deputies here, led by our spokesperson, Deputy Carthy, have outlined and will outline the disastrous genocide taking place. We have to refer Israel to the International Criminal Court. We have to take a stand in line with our tradition in this country of standing up for people who are oppressed and standing up against oppressive regimes.	spk_154

The Tánaiste spoke about the UNRWA and the UN refugee camps. He knows there are 3 million Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. I saw many of them myself when I visited the camps in Lebanon where refugees were staying with other refugees as a result of the latest wave of Israeli oppression. The Tánaiste knows there are 1.7 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, out of a population of 2.1 million. He knows there are 880,000 refugees, impoverished people, in the West Bank, and the world looked the other way. He knows about the 1967 borders and how the Palestinian people were packed into camps in the West Bank and Gaza and separated from each other. There are 5 million people living under oppression and the military apartheid regime, and the world looked the other way. The Tánaiste knows about the UN resolutions passed again and again, and the world looked the other way. He knows from reports by Amnesty International, B'Tselem reports and Human Rights Watch that Israel is an apartheid state, and the world looks the other way. The Tánaiste spoke about a two-state solution. He knows what Israel has done to the two-state solution. It has destroyed it to the point that the Palestinian people have lost all confidence in it.

Lucia took a framed photograph of her beloved son with her, which was set up on the table during the meeting. I have been a public representative for about 21 years. In all those years, I have rarely seen somebody so impacted by an injustice. The darkness that was brought into this beautiful family was absolutely profound. They are a hard-working Irish family who have never done a thing wrong in their lives, but their beloved son was mowed down by a man who was a criminal on multiple occasions in multiple jurisdictions. Those in the justice system did not talk to one another. The Garda and the PSNI did not talk to each other. It is suspected that this individual was a Garda informer. There has to be some explanation for how in God's name all of this was allowed to happen and of the circumstances that led, when he was cycling near to his home on that summer evening, to Shane O'Farrell being mown down. I join Deputy McGuinness in expressing my absolute outrage at the suggestion that Shane O'Farrell was responsible for his own death. God almighty. Has not enough injury been caused to this family without suggesting that the Road Safety Authority guidelines for cyclists should have been adhered to? I challenge anybody to walk around the streets of this city, watch cyclists go around this city and, if one of them was knocked down, to straight away say that as the cyclist did not technically adhere to the Road Safety Authority guidelines, he or she is responsible for his or her own death. This cannot stand. It cannot stand that we have a scoping exercise instead of a public inquiry. Both Houses have spoken and called for a public inquiry because the circumstances are so egregious and of such deep concern to every right-thinking citizen that such an inquiry is what is required. Instead, we have had a scoping exercise that has dragged on for years and has caused huge offence to the family because it stated Shane O'Farrell did not have a light on the back of his bike, as Deputy McGuinness said. Sweet God almighty. All of us have an average level of intelligence. We can figure out for ourselves that there has been a profound injustice, in that this person should never have been unleashed in our community. He should have been behind bars. The justice system failed profoundly in that people in it did not talk to each other. However, it might even be worse. This person may have been protected. This person may have been an informer of this State. As for this person, who inflicted this unbelievable pain on this beautiful Irish family, this may have been covered up. That is why we need a public inquiry. Nothing else will do. This outrage of a report, the so-called scoping exercise, has to be thrown in the bin and the will of the Houses has to be implemented.	spk_223

The CDNTs have collapsed. The vacancy rate is approximately 57% in the two areas in north Donegal It is an absolute disaster and it has real implications. The presentations yesterday from parents of children with disabilities were absolutely harrowing. We had senior HSE officials, Deputies and county councillors but most important of all, the parents. I want to put a couple of issues to the Minister and the Minister of State. Can there be an emergency fund for parents so they can go to the private sector in the absence of an occupational therapist, a speech and language therapist, a psychologist, social worker, etc.? Can there be redeployment from the primary care centres? A number of urgent interventions require national guidance for the HSE. We cannot tolerate a situation any more where the system, as Deputy Doherty said, forces families to fight. These families are trying to support their children. They are trying to be there for their children. They are tired, they are weary and they do not want to fight. None of those parents needed to come in yesterday, but that is where we are at. I urge the Minister to please intervene in Donegal and see what can be done at the highest level to sort out the problems there.	spk_244

The total of that budget was €337.45 million, which he stated was a 62% increase on the previous budget. Those of us who were listening to fishing communities and fish producers around the coast believed that the figures were doctored, the money was coming from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve fund, and the Minister was announcing investment in piers and harbours as though it were Government expenditure. This is redundancy money that is being given to our fishing communities because the EU has taken away so much of our quota and we have had to decommission even more of our vessels. We are giving away more of the fish in our waters and we are losing our industry. The Minister claimed that redundancy money as Government expenditure and announced a ""record budget"". I checked and double-checked this year’s budget because I thought it could not be right. I looked at it again today. It amounts to a drop of almost 50% on what the Minister announced last year. It is €176.9 million. What was announced in the budget yesterday was shocking. This industry around our coast is struggling to survive. In the past 12 months, there has been a 15% reduction in production in the fishing industry, the fleet has reduced by 30%, Ireland’s fishing quota in our own waters has been reduced by in the region of 20% and approximately 1,000 people at sea and ashore have lost their jobs. The industry is struggling. I do not want to use the term “on its knees”, as I know the fishers and fish producers around the coast and they are hard-working and proud people who are trying to save their industry, but they need the Government to meet them halfway. The Minister knows that he claimed a record budget last year and a 62% increase, but that was not true. The Government was claiming European money. This year, it will have to stand over that claim in light of the reduction of 50%. This is a disastrous budget for our fishing community and I do not know how the Government can stand over it."	spk_183

As the Minister of State is aware, I am from the same region as them. He will know the significant public transport deficits in that region. The reality is that, sadly, public transport is not an option for most people who are working, studying or trying to run a business in our county. They need to have a car. The electric vehicle infrastructure is not there, so that is not a possibility. The carbon tax, which is another issue, is supposed to punish people for not taking better alternatives but, in places like the area from which Deputies Doherty and Kenny and I come, there are no alternatives. The proposed increases will not occur in isolation. They will be added on top of increases in the cost of energy, electricity, food. Everywhere the people we represent turn, they are getting squeezed. Many people are really struggling and making tough decisions in their lives. Those families are filled with dread at the thought of these increases. They see the price at the pumps increasing every week, back up toward the dreaded €2 level. We are appealing to the Government to listen to us, particularly in the context of the parts of the country from which I and my colleagues come - rural areas near the Border where people have to get by. The difference the increases would make is significant. People tell me they hear reports about surplus, full employment and the country never having had it so good, but that is not what they see in their lives. It is not their lived experience. What they see is that they just cannot make the numbers add up every week and all these components compound each other. In the context of this issue, the Government has it in its power not to make their situation even worse. We are appealing to the Government to support the motion and the call we are making and to try to do what it can. Obviously, there are wider issues but we are focusing on this one tonight. We are asking the Government to hear what Sinn Féin is saying and do what is right.	spk_335

To be frank, Minister, we have had these exchanges before. I hope there will be changes in the culture in the Minister’s Department because I do not believe that fishing communities have been valued the way they should have been.

Fishers from Dublin and Wicklow have built up a good whelk fishery, but it is under serious threat as a result of what has happened. Will the Minister agree to meet the National Inshore Fishermen’s Association, in particular the fishers from the east coast who are on that body, and listen to their experience so as to ensure that what they have been through is not repeated anywhere on this island? This is a shared marine resource with three key stakeholders – the people who protect our ecosystem, the fishing communities and the offshore renewable energy industry. We need to ensure there is a level playing pitch for all.	spk_3
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	50	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2023-07-13	dail	33	Fishing Industry	dbsect_3	The inshore fishers on the east coast have had an horrific experience. It can never be repeated anywhere in Ireland. They have correspondence, which I have seen, from the Director General of the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, DG MARE, Ms Charlina Vitcheva. She laid out very clearly the balance that needed to be struck between developing offshore renewable energy and protecting the marine ecosystems, fishing communities and traditional fishing grounds. To be frank, Minister, we have had these exchanges before. I hope there will be changes in the culture in the Minister’s Department because I do not believe that fishing communities have been valued the way they should have been. The events on the east coast happened because there was no respect for fishing communities and fishers. The sole motivation was just one stakeholder, that being, renewable energy. I hope that culture will be brought to an end and we deal with this properly in the best interests of everyone.	spk_5

The planning system in the North of Ireland has profoundly failed the people of the north west - Donegal, Derry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Sligo, Cavan and Monaghan. There is an overwhelming desire to have equality of access and infrastructure for our people with the rest of the island. When we look at the map we can see, rightly so, motorways and train links connecting communities across the island. As the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, knows, there is a huge deficit in our region. The system utterly failed us. It allowed a small minority of voices to hold back, prevent and block what was for the overwhelming good of all of our people. That is a system that is not fit for purpose. Sometimes when systems fail, it takes the powerful voices of ordinary people, who never wanted to be in that position, to make the change. On the night of the launch of Enough is Enough, there were some powerful speeches. One of them that was played back to us earlier on was from Peter Canavan, the great Gaelic footballer from Tyrone. Peter talked about a memory that never left him. He is from that area. A beloved member of staff in the local school was knocked down, and they saw her lying on the side of the road. That never left him. Earlier tonight, we had Kate Corrigan. Kate should not have to come here and tell her story of the devastation her family has experienced because of the loss of her son. I said to her earlier that sometimes the victim who tells his or her story - somebody who has been utterly failed - is far more powerful than all the MPs, TDs and MLAs that we could put there. When people who have been failed speak out, they speak to the decency of most people and they shame us that the system that is in place has failed them. That has to stop and we have to make sure now that the A5 project proceeds. I am pleased that the Government supports this motion, because it means that the commitment that was made all those years ago for a 50:50 funding for this road is now back on the table again. That is what this motion means tonight. That is an important message when we get these planning issues finally resolved. It is thanks to the communities who rose up in Tyrone, who are backed by all the communities in the counties around them 100%. I also want to talk about the projects in Donegal; the TEN-T project and the road and route improvement project, because they face delays too. The Ballybofey to Stranorlar bypass has been delayed for years. The Letterkenny relief road has also been delayed for years. We have a situation where there are logjams, in particular in Letterkenny, but also in Ballybofey and Stranorlar, because of the failure to deliver road projects. The systems in place have failed our people but there is finally momentum there too. This TEN-T project is being well led by the national road design office. It wants to connect Letterkenny by means of a dual carriageway through Manorcunningham into Lifford. It is all about making sure that we have the full benefit of the A5 when it happens for the people of Donegal, with the TEN-T improvement project, and also of course for Monaghan, Meath, Louth and Cavan in terms of the N2 and all the related roads connecting them. Our people deserve equality of access, and the systems have failed them North and South, but there is real momentum now. There are really capable people driving the project in Donegal. Deputy Doherty and I can speak with real authority about that. They are very capable people and they have got a great plan. They have submitted the business plan to the Government and we need the Government to get behind it. That is what this motion also says tonight. My final comment is that our people are united in Donegal, Tyrone, Derry, Fermanagh, Sligo, Cavan and Monaghan. We are united with one voice to say that we want the same access, the same citizenship and the same respect as everybody else in every community on this island.	spk_242

We had a story in this country of which we could be truly proud with the electrification of our country when times were really tough - Ardnacrusha. We built up an electricity supply sector that was publicly owned and the cheapest in Europe, something of which we could be immensely proud. When liberalisation policies were requested by Europe, we had Thatcherite governments that could not move quickly enough to sell off the family jewels. Remember when they privatised our services. Today because of those Thatcherite policies by the governments in place at the time, we have the second most expensive electricity in Europe compared to once having the cheapest with a publicly owned supply of which we could have been proud. We just allowed the private energy companies to screw our people again and again. When the most devastating recent increases were being introduced, incredibly, our Government was reluctant to look at a windfall tax. Sinn Féin called for it again and again. It was ruled out. The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, said it would undermine the economy and that it was the wrong thing to do. Then the European Commission moved on it but even when the European Commission moved on it and directed that it needed to happen in solidarity with families and businesses across Europe, our Government dithered and dithered. What is going on? To use the famous phrase, this is supposed to be a Government of the people by the people for the people. How can it be that there is such fear of standing up to profiteering and reckless policies by the energy companies? How can it be that we have no compassion for the stories the Minister of State has heard from this side of this Chamber again and again about the devastating impact of this on families and disgusting increases for something that is essential? It is essential for any family or business to have electricity. We have abandoned this to reckless profiteering and when the opportunity came from the European Commission and governments in other countries that would share the right-of-centre views of the current Government in Ireland, the Government still dithered. Even now, we are not clear about what it is going to do. We know that what is proposing does not go far enough, does not ask enough of the companies involved in this profiteering and does not secure enough revenue for our people and we do not know how the Government is going to disburse that revenue and make sure those who can least afford these increases will be assisted. We have to make it clear that these were Thatcherite policies. They talk about Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, what they did and their ideology but we have governments in this country that were called centrist. They were supposedly reasonable pragmatists but, no, we had Thatcherite governments that sold our natural resources. The reason we are going to look at Corrib is that we handed away our natural resources around our coast. There is a lack of ambition for our people. The Government just hands everything to the private sector and allows it to do what it will. The implications of that ideology, particularly from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, have led to our housing crisis where we abandoned everything to the private sector, institutional investors and profiteers. We are also doing it with energy. This is Thatcherite right-wing ideology that has no ambition for our people and no ambition for our natural resources and ensures naked profiteering and greed win the day. Even when it is dragged kicking and screaming by the European Commission, the Government still dithers. I look at the Minister of State and I wonder because I do not think that was his view when he entered politics. I do not think he is a Thatcherite but what is he doing in government with people like this? What is he doing voting for policies like this? He has to ask himself that question. There are people in the Green Party who share the vision of those of us on this side of the House. What is the Minister of State doing putting up with this? What is he doing defending and going along with this? He must ask himself that question because he knows in his heart that this was the abandonment of a proud policy and giving in to profiteering and greed. It has to stop some time.	spk_184

There is a situation whereby schools across the country have welcomed children from refugee and asylum-seeking families with a good heart. They are nurturing and educating those children, and have welcomed them into their schools. I want to give an example from one school in Donegal but there are many other examples I could give across the county and the country. I have one example on my desk. Sessiaghoneill National School had 152 children enrolled on 30 September, which is the date on which enrolment is reported. Within weeks, it had an extra 52 children from asylum-seeker and refugee families. That is an increase of one third in the school population. However, it has not received any additional financial support per child in the school, as would be normal. This school has nurtured, cared for and educated these children with a good heart. It estimates the situation has cost it over €30,000. It has nothing left in its bank account. Apparently, officials from the Department of Education advised the school to consider going to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or the Red Cross. That is a school that was looking to care for and nurture children. It has been left in considerable financial difficulty and nobody will resolve the issue for it. Everybody says they are sorry but if the kids in question are not registered on 30 September, nothing can be done. That is crazy bureaucracy. People are looking at this situation whereby the resources of the school have run dry. There are also people who are organising accommodation across the country and making a hell of a lot of money from this crisis. Some of them are very good at providing accommodation and some of them are not so good but are still making a hell of a lot of money from this crisis. This is a small school and we are leaving it €30,000 in the red while we are enriching some people across the State. People see that. They are intelligent and see that. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that this is wrong. There will be schools across the country with tremendous people who are nurturers, educators and carers, providing wonderful environments for these kids who are coming from all sorts of situations. The lives of those kids have been turned upside down and they have experienced enormous trauma. These are exactly the types of environments we want them to be in. The people who make provision for them should be compensated, at the very least. Children from the parish in question and children who have come here from another country should both attract the same level of financial assistance from the Department. This situation is wrong. It is bureaucracy. I know the Minister of State is going to read a statement on behalf of the Department of Education which will lay out some formulaic policy.

They have walked out of the Public Gallery in response to his words because he gave pretty much the same speech here last November. There is absolute tone deafness among the likes of the LGMA, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Government. How can the Minister possibly connect the working pay and conditions that have been so well reported to the people of Ireland over the past week on our public airwaves, namely, the shocking conditions where the firefighters are supposed to be available 50 weeks of the year, 24-7, within 3 km of their stations. With the type of pay and conditions they have, how can the Minister possibly compare them with every other public sector worker? That is the point. They have very separate pay, conditions and treatment, from all other public sector workers. How can it possibly be undermining a collective pay agreement to deal with that issue, to treat them fairly and with the dignity and fairness they deserve. I find it astonishing for anybody on one side of the negotiations to say that if they give the firefighters parity of treatment and dignity with all other public sector workers, they would be breaking a deal. Will the Minister name one public sector worker who will object to treating those firefighters properly? Will he name one public sector worker that would say ""I am sorry but you have broken the collective pay agreement"" if firefighters were treated properly and fairly at last? This is an arrangement from the 1950s. It is from back in the day when a mechanic or a farmer might have been asked to respond as a community service. This is 2023. People have to put a roof over their heads. They have to look after their families and deal with massive costs. We know all about the house prices and rent prices. We have taken the salt of the earth of our country for granted for far too long. These are people with civic pride. They are agonising about this strike because if a fire or a road traffic collision happens in their community, they know the people involved. It is absolutely agonising to force people like that to go on strike. Will the Minister please not come up with this nonsense about the collective agreement being broken in doing the right thing by firefighters. He has to pull back from that position and do it urgently. We are in an awful situation here."	spk_156
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	50	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2023-06-01	dail	33	Report on the Good Friday Agreement: Motion	dbsect_41	The Good Friday Agreement was a momentous achievement, not only by political leaders on the island of Ireland but also facilitated by political leaders in the United States, the European Union and others internationally. I am almost 50 now. It was half my life ago. In the first half of my life, I witnessed nothing but conflict. I saw it in my family first hand, in my community and across the Border in the nearest city, Derry. The agreement was of huge importance but it must be nurtured. That is why there has been a range of agreements since the Good Friday Agreement to try to embolden it. We had the Weston Park Agreement in 2001, the St. Andrews Agreement in 2006, the Hillsborough Agreement in 2010, the Stormont House Agreement in 2014, the Fresh Start agreement in 2015 and the most recent agreement, New Decade, New Approach, in 2020. We can see that the agreement needs consistent nurturing and challenging. In recent times, the role of the Conservative Party Government in Britain has been of huge concern. It clearly built a relationship with the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, which I believe led to the collapse of the institutions. It has engaged in utterly reckless political behaviour for its own selfish interests. It dispensed with the DUP when it suited, but we are all still dealing with the mess. Clearly, the Irish Government is a co-guarantor. It must consistently challenge the British Government when it acts in bad faith. I will wrap up with a few areas on which the Irish Government needs to step up, including voting rights for Irish citizens in the North. They should have the right to vote for their President the next time the opportunity comes around in 2025. It would be outrageous if there were no referendum to allow that to happen. It should happen at the earliest opportunity. We also need a citizens' assembly.We are on the pathway to Irish reunification. What happened with Brexit was reckless. There was no preparation or dialogue and we were let slip and sleepwalk into that scenario. I appeal to the Irish Government to organise a citizens’ assembly to prepare responsibly for the question that will inevitably be put to our people in the next decade about Irish reunification.	spk_340

I thank the Social Democrats for its motion. I will repeat what I said to the Minister of State on that occasion. Last year, just seven of the 31 local authorities in the State delivered affordable housing. There is a complete failure to deliver affordable housing. In my home county, Donegal, we have a perfect storm, as the Minister of State well knows. We have the defective blocks crisis and thousands of homes will have to be demolished and rebuilt. Our housing market is in absolute chaos. People cannot buy or sell a home in north Donegal, be it a public or private home.Is the Minister of State aware that Donegal County Council, thanks to the Government's bureaucratic and crazy affordable system, has no plans whatsoever to build affordable housing? We have families who have no clue how they will rebuild their lives. Every day, as a public representative, I speak to families in Donegal who tell me they cannot make this Government scheme rebuild their homes. They tell me they have to find tens of thousands of euros. Somebody yesterday told me of having to find €125,000 to be able to rebuild their home, because of the cruelty of the Minister of State's party, which has been in power for 12 years. The Minister of State and the officials he works with have displayed absolutely cruelty in making people have to put square pegs into round holes in Donegal. It is devastating people's lives. Older people, at the end of life, cannot get a mortgage or bridging loans. People have children with disabilities and do not know what they will do. They face cruelty and inhumanity from officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and indifference from politicians in government. People are told to sort it out themselves or told what they will get and are left to find tens of thousands of euro. I wanted to raise that with regard to home ownership, because these people will have no home ownership.	spk_29

I want to report back to the Minister that I met with fishermen from Wicklow just before I came to speak in the Dáil and they are very clear. I speak to fishermen all around the coast. They do not feel that they have a partnership with the wind energy companies and that they are equals in terms of sharing the marine resource. The Minister will agree that there are three key stakeholders here: the wind energy companies, the people in the environmental NGOs which are looking at our marine ecosystem and there are fishing communities. This is a shared marine resource. We can get to the place that all co-exist. All of these responsibilities can be delivered, the full potential of our marine space can be realised but I am asking the Minister to make it clear in his engagements with the wind energy companies that they have to be serious about partnership, about dialogue, about listening to fishermen about the best location for turbines and about compensation where the fisheries are lost. There is a need for the Minister to lead the way and to state explicitly, I hope in his wrap-up comments today, that we can do all of these things, that we can achieve energy independence for our island, develop the capacity of offshore wind, protect the fisheries for our fishing communities and protect our marine ecosystem. It is important that the Minister makes a statement explicitly in that regard that instructs the wind energy companies to engage as equal partners and to meet their responsibilities in the time ahead.	spk_203

At the Business Committee last Thursday, I made it clear this Private Members' business would be on hospitals, relevant to that Minister. He has not given any apologies to our colleague and spokesperson on health, Deputy Cullinane. It is really disrespectful. What is happening in our health service is having a profound impact across the country on families and is incredibly cruel on the doctors and nurses carrying this impossible burden because they do not have the necessary supports. We are extremely concerned about Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal. We are extremely concerned about conditions in the emergency department and the lack of doctors, nurses and beds and have raised it year in, year out. What has happened in recent days is shocking. We had a situation where we had one consultant endocrinologist dealing with a massive burden of diabetes patients in Donegal. The clinical advice is the waiting time for an appointment should be six months for an adult with diabetes, and that is long enough. In Donegal, they are waiting 24 months, which is extremely dangerous. All the work on diabetes shows earlier intervention and more supports going in mean less impact down the line. We had one consultant endocrinologist working his socks off. Recently, we had a second one appointed who, within weeks, resigned. Now, the existing consultant endocrinologist is going too. We are without a support service of any substance in Letterkenny hospital. People were waiting 24 months and now they could be waiting even longer. This is a crisis. The Donegal branch of Diabetes Ireland spoke out about this yesterday. Its representatives met with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, when he was last in Donegal. I appeal to the Minister of State to speak to the Minister to make him aware of what the Donegal branch is appealing for: an urgent intervention from the Minister with the hospital to make sure there are necessary diabetes care supports.

In 1984, the workers at Dunnes Stores led the way, and within a few years the Irish Government had followed suit and put in place sanctions and bans against the South African apartheid regime. Ireland led the way in confronting apartheid in the world. How did we get to where we are today? How have we gone so wrong? How did we get to a position where Governments refuse to listen to their own people in regard to the apartheid being inflicted today by the Israeli state on the Palestinian people? How can it be that the Occupied Territories Bill has not been enacted by this Government, a Bill that says we do not do commerce with war criminals? Under international law, what is happening in the Occupied Territories is a war crime. This Dáil has passed that motion yet we do commerce with people involved in war crimes. Not only that, when we have a Bill like this that says we should stop investing in companies that are involved in these activities, the Government says “Kick it back for nine months, we cannot deal with it now.” How can our Government take a moral stand in the world when it continues to allow commerce to be done with people involved in war crimes, when it cannot stop investing in the businesses involved in war crimes and when it cannot even recognise the state of Palestine? It is utterly shameful how far Governments have fallen from the way we followed the Dunnes Stores workers in 1984. To be very clear about this, the Irish people will always stand against oppression and apartheid. The Irish people stood against the South African regime and the Irish people stand against the modern-day apartheid being inflicted by the Israeli state today. If the Government refuses to listen to them, the next Government will do what is right, but it should be happening tonight and it should not have to wait until the next election to do what is right by our people.	spk_254

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	50	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2023-05-03	dail	33	Construction Safety Licensing Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_14	The history of the regulation of construction and quarries in Ireland is really appalling and counties like Donegal are paying a profound price for that. I live in Buncrana, the epicentre of the defective blocks crisis. Not a day goes by that I do not talk to a family whose lives are utterly destroyed by the fact that their homes are falling apart. It is about not just the cost of fixing it but also the mental health effects and the utter devastation. This is not just about defective blocks either. It is about defective apartments, pyrite, mica, pyrrhotite, iron sulphide and the absolute failure to regulate the industry. Even as we speak, technically the quarries that produced these defective blocks that fall apart like Weetabix are still not subject to proper regulation. They still self-regulate to a large extent. I want to take the opportunity to speak in this debate because part of this legislation focuses on quarries and on the training of people in this industry to do things properly, to have a standard and to have oversight. That is very welcome. The body that is tasked at present to some degree with oversight of the quarries to ensure things are done properly is the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office, NBCMSO, linked to Dublin City Council. That body was tasked with carrying out an audit, in partnership with Donegal County Council and the Geological Survey of Ireland, of the quarries in Donegal to see what is the state of play as we speak. I attended the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage when it engaged with the NBCMSO after it completed the audit. I found it really alarming that even after the utter devastation caused to thousands of families in Donegal, Mayo and other counties in the west of Ireland - it is estimated that as many as 14 counties are affected, which makes this a growing crisis - and even after what the Government has said will cost us billions of euro, we still have not got access to test some of the quarries we know to be responsible for this crisis. Petrographic tests of these quarries have not been done because the people who were doing the audit could not get access. I cannot think of a scandal that has devastated so many people, at a cost of billions of euro to the State and untold costs for years and decades to come, and still we do not have full accountability or full access to the truth and cannot give full assurance to people that this will never happen again. That is why I wanted to raise this today. We have to be 100% certain that this will never happen again, that no quarry in Ireland will be allowed to produce products of the devastating impact that some produced. It is not just an issue in Donegal but right down the west of Ireland, involving a wide range of counties. In terms of the audit that was carried out by the NBCMSO, the recommendations for training and so on, this new body will have oversight of that.We need to make sure - this is the key issue - that we do not allow quarries to produce concrete blocks that have too high a content of pyrrhotite, iron sulphites, mica, pyrite or any of the minerals that are defined in Irish law and in European law. We must not allow it to happen. It cannot be allowed to happen. We must ensure that there is not self-regulation, whereby builders just do whatever they want. There must be full oversight - full eyes upon this industry - to make sure this never happens again. Whatever about the devastated families in Donegal, the west of Ireland and other counties, this will impact every citizen of this State. It will cost multiple billions of euro by the time this is all finished. That is the cost of providing redress for all the families. I cannot think of any other scandal where we would not make sure it could absolutely never happen again. In terms of this legislation, which is a welcome step in the right direction, I ask that we absolutely ensure that quarries can never again produce defective concrete blocks, that they absolutely comply with Irish and European law, and that every effort is made to oversee them, get access to the quarries, train them and apply the law rigorously. That is the least we can do to repay the debt to the many thousands of families whose lives have been destroyed because of the failures of the past.	spk_172

Oftentimes, and perhaps most often, speaking of such agreements or processes is within the context of constitutional issues, ideology or national aspirations. These are by their very nature crucial and important matters, deserving of respect in terms of the genuine aspiration from where they come.We should never get away from the crucial component, namely, the impact on ordinary people, families and communities. In that context, it is immediately apparent why the Good Friday Agreement is referenced and respected as it is. That is because it has delivered. We in Ireland lived in a society and community where political conflict was to the fore but are now commonly referred to as a post-conflict society. That is something of which all parties should be proud, cherish and have a responsibility to nurture. We should nurture it because the Good Friday Agreement has not been implemented in full, with legacy issues a crucial area at present. It is incumbent on us all to ensure that, as we look to the future, we honestly and properly address and have regard to the past. Victims, their families, all political parties, the Irish Government and the human rights commission have highlighted major flaws with legislation pertaining to this matter that is being progressed by the British Government. The legacy Bill represents a clear breach of British Government commitments in two international treaties, namely, the Stormont House and New Decade, New Approach agreements. Instead of fostering and building upon our peace and seeking to meet the needs of all our people, the Bill stands clearly as representing a blatant disregard for victims. The Stormont House Agreement, agreed by the Irish and British Governments as well as the political parties, provides an agreed framework and mechanisms to give victims access to the truth and justice they rightly deserve in a human rights-compliant manner. The truth is that agents of the British state were central to the murder of hundreds of nationalists and republicans throughout the decades of the conflict. They utterly controlled the loyalist paramilitaries. They armed them, handed them intelligence and then covered up their deeds again and again. The British Government must accept responsibility for the actions of its agents as part of the truth and reconciliation path we are all on. It is incumbent on the Government to prepare responsibly for the border poll that is referenced in the Good Friday Agreement. Those of us who advocate for Irish reunification have a responsibility to make our case and to win hearts and minds in this democracy. We in Sinn Féin, along with many others across this island, are proposing the establishment of a citizens' assembly to do just that. While the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement focuses on the past, the lessons we have to learn and the positives that were achieved, we now have a responsibility to look to the future and start to imagine what a future Ireland will look like. We need to start to talk to each other and discuss our responsibilities rather than wishing it away or that time will be delayed and stalled. We have that responsibility. It is now the responsibility of the Tánaiste, Deputy Martin, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who are present, as well as that of the Taoiseach, to establish a citizens' assembly. They say they advocate for Irish reunification and wish to see it. It is time to prepare for the border poll that will be coming down the line, not to wish it away.	spk_229

I want to share with the Minister the situation in Donegal just to illustrate the madness of the way the Government approaches housing. We have well over 7,000 vacant homes in Donegal. Those are not holiday homes but vacant homes and this is at a time when we have a profound housing crisis. There are 2,500 families on the social housing list and the delivery of social housing by the Government in Donegal is appalling. We have the defective block scandal and crisis in the county as well. We are looking at homes in every housing estate and across the highways and byways of our counties that are lying empty, many of them in the possession of banks. The significant majority of these houses could be rented out soon with a dedicated application and with a focus from the Government. It is a scandal that we have families in Donegal telling us that they are facing homelessness because they have an eviction notice, while there are vacant houses all around them. What has happened is that, as we speak, Donegal County Council will hire just one vacant homes officer in a county the size of Donegal. How on earth will one person overturn the scale of the crisis? The Minister has to wake up; there is an emergency happening in this country. It is like there is a fire and a house is burning down and the people in charge of the fire brigade are drinking coffee and eating doughnuts all the while and telling us they are taking it seriously. It is incredible that one vacant homes officer is being recruited just now when the Government has known that there are thousands of empty houses and that it is a profound crisis. There are people whose homes have to be knocked down because of the failure of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, when they were in government, to regulate the concrete block industry. That is what we are facing. When will the Government wake up and apply an urgent approach to this crisis? Why is the Government not sitting down with Donegal County Council and asking how many officers it needs and what sort of resources are required to rebuild those houses, make it happen and get people permanent roofs over their heads? The Government has to listen to us in the Opposition when we have motions like this. It is an excellent motion drafted by the Social Democrats and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and the Government has to take it seriously and engage. The Government says we do not provide solutions. It gets solutions from us again and again every week but it brushes them aside and the crisis and emergency continues.	spk_36

The Minister for Education will be aware that a range of schools across Donegal have waited for many years for badly needed improvements and new school projects. I will start with Moville Community College. It is a tremendous school. Students have a tremendous experience there. It has tremendous teachers and a tremendous community that is being failed by totally inadequate school buildings on a totally inadequate school campus. Young people are eating their food in the hallway at lunchtime. There are inadequate classrooms and physical education, PE, facilities. They are totally inadequate when we consider the sheer quality of the teachers and the whole community. They have been waiting for many years. There is devastatingly slow progress. Finally, they were ready to go to tender. Although the Minister has not published the list of schools, I have responses to parliamentary questions relating to Moville Community College that clearly state it has been referred to the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform and is being considered. However, the Minister has not published a list. There is serious concern about Moville Community College. The planning permission for Scoil Íosagáin in Buncrana expired because the Government took far too many years to deal with this issue. It has planning permission again and is ready to go. It has had inadequate school buildings for many years and it is again delayed. There are also concerns around the three-school campus in Buncrana, which includes Crana College and the Gaelscoileanna in Buncrana. They have been waiting for many years. There was messing around over a site. It is a question of bureaucracy, total failure, a lost decade and we do not want this project to be caught up again. Parents are asking what is going on with Gaelscoil na gCeithre Máistrí. It has waited for many years. The school thought it was ready to go and there would not be any more delays, but it is facing more delays. Those are a few examples from Donegal. The Minister needs to deal with these issues urgently.	spk_637

Not everybody is able to go online and operate like that with credit cards. There is a section of people who will be excluded if this is the way we proceed. I am glad that Deputy Gould mentioned AIB because what it had proposed was outrageous. They were essentially to close access to cash facilities, including ATMs, at their banks in vast swathes of rural Ireland. In Donegal, it was to have a significant impact. The GAA clubs were to the fore in speaking out against that. Thankfully, AIB, with the public backlash and the fact that we have substantial State control of it, did what was right eventually, but it should not have taken all of that. I am really disappointed with the cashless approach the GAA has taken. It needs to listen to the grassroots and in particular make sure that older people who have been the bedrock of their clubs for years can go along to the games. Anybody who follows the GAA and goes to those matches sees that historically there is a large number of older people for whom it is where they socially interact and have the craic every Sunday. That decision needs to be reversed. It needs to be accessible to all. If you look at the National Driver Licence Service, in Donegal you cannot pay with cash if you go to avail of your driving licence. I am starting to see increasingly it creeping in that a section of people are excluded. I thank the Rural Independent Group for this important motion because there has been a drift towards cash being rejected, and cash is legal tender. No citizen should be denied access, certainly to something that is a public service or a community service, if he or she has legal tender in his or her hands and is willing to pay. We need to stop this and we need to listen to our communities and our grassroots and confront those who are acting against those interests.	spk_31

We have a significant challenge with our ambulance service across the county. On too many occasions, people in life-threatening situations have waited for too long and in some instances they have lost their lives unnecessarily. One proposal that has been put forward to the Government again and again relates to fire and rescue personnel. In Donegal, as in all rural counties, we have fully-trained emergency responders who are being totally underutilised. There are fire stations dotted throughout Donegal and staff from them could be deployed as emergency first responders in cardiac and respiratory emergencies. This is a tremendous back-up service which is ready to go and is not being deployed. I ask that the National Ambulance Service proactively engage with local authorities to make sure there is a memorandum of understanding and local authorities are not financially punished for using that. Sinn Féin tabled a motion on the future of the fire and rescue service across the State. We have personnel who are respected and trusted in communities having to protest outside the Dáil and gather in the Public Gallery. They have asked to be deployed as emergency first responders as an initial response until the ambulance gets there. I want to impress on the Government that we have an under-resourced National Ambulance Service. The response times across the country are totally unacceptable but I must speak with authority about Donegal. I cannot understand, for the life of me, why there has been a failure to make sure the National Ambulance Service and local authorities reach an agreement, why the local authorities are not financially punished and why our fire and rescue personnel are not being deployed properly.	spk_30

In terms of House etiquette, that is certainly challengeable, especially since most of the Opposition Members have not had their say yet. I will raise an issue and maybe the Minister of State could raise it with his senior colleague. A cross-party delegation of councillors from Donegal came here today and protested outside. We are on the subject of people in desperate situations and trying to protect them. There is a sense put out by Government that the owners of homes with defective blocks are sorted now and that everything is fine. If that is the case, why did a cross-party delegation come here today? Around 20 councillors came here today and gave a presentation in the audiovisual room. What they said is very clear. These families, some of them with children with disabilities, some with persons with disabilities, and some who are older people and pensioners, are being asked to engage with building contractors and try to find alternative accommodation for a year when there is nothing to be found - certainly nothing that would suit people with disabilities. The Government has just washed its hands of the matter and claimed that it has no responsibility. It has been repeatedly asked if the Housing Agency can be deployed to build urgent temporary modular accommodation and has refused. It has been asked to engage with holiday-home owners who might have properties available. The response has been, ""No, it's nothing to do with us. There is your money. Away you go."" Of course, they will not get 100% redress because the Government will not let the Housing Agency run the project. The Government is expecting traumatised homeowners, whose lives have been destroyed, to try to engage building contractors to put a square plug into a round hole, to try to make an amount of money fit that cannot fit, to make them pay tens of thousands of euro. I ask the Minister of State to speak to his senior colleague who has left early because he did not have the courtesy to stay and listen to our point of view. Will the Minister meet members of Donegal County Council? Will he meet the councillors who were here today, including his Government party councillors who have called the scheme a sham? They have called out their own Government and said that the Minister needs to get up there urgently. People will be on the street again very soon in Donegal, Mayo, Clare and all these counties. They are in a desperate situation. The Government has put out a message that it is all solved. It has tried to con the people but very soon the people will be very aware of the scale of this. I again appeal to the Minister of State to ask his senior colleague to have the decency to read the transcript, given that he left early. He needs to go to Donegal and Mayo to meet the councillors who are profoundly concerned on behalf of our people."	spk_240
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	50	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2023-02-01	dail	33	Council Development Levies: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I thank the Independent Group for tabling this important motion. In County Donegal, as well as in counties Mayo, Sligo, Clare and Limerick, thousands of families are living in defective concrete block homes. For many years, they were stymied and held back from getting justice and a redress scheme that would allow them to rebuild their lives. They did nothing wrong. Due to light-touch regulation and the absence of regulation in this State, they were left with homes that are falling apart. It took 20,000 people to come to the streets of Dublin, mostly from my home county of Donegal and the other counties I mentioned, to finally make the Government see some sense, yet we still do not have a redress scheme that is fair. What I found most objectionable was Government leadership figures talking about having to pay out billions. They were speaking to the rest of the taxpayers, telling them this would cost billions of their money. There was no talk about injustice or the failure of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments over many years. The intention was basically to divide and conquer citizens and to take away the empathy and solidarity for those families whose lives had been destroyed. The same Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael leadership figures have choices to make at every single budget. Yesterday, I and other Deputies, including Deputy Pringle, hosted a very important briefing from Oxfam Ireland and Social Justice Ireland. What they revealed was astonishing. Just two people in this country earn more than half the population. The combined wealth of these two people is €15 billion, while the combined wealth of half the population, those at the other end of the spectrum, is €10.2 billion. There is a failure in every budget to put in place a fair wealth tax. Oxfam Ireland believes that a fair incremental tax on the wealthiest, those earning over €4.7 million per year, could raise €8.2 billion every year. The Government complained about a cost of between €2.5 billion and €3 billion for a defective block scheme that would be spread over 20 years. That is approximately €250 million or €300 million per year over a 20-year period. The Government could, however, raise more than €8.2 billion per year from a modest tax on the wealthiest in society. My final point is on the type of wealth these people have. It is not productive and does not benefit the country. It goes into investment funds and so on and floats around the unproductive economy. This proposal makes absolute sense. I ask the Government to be honest when it tries to divide and conquer our citizens in future.	spk_28

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	50	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2023-01-25	dail	33	Inshore Fishing: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	"First, I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this motion. It has been my honour and privilege to work alongside Deputy Collins, particularly over the last three years. We have relentlessly raised the plight of our fishing communities in this Chamber, in the committees and out there in the wider community. I look forward to working with Deputy Collins over the time ahead. He is very passionate about our fishing communities. We produced a document a number of years ago. At the time I toured pretty much all the piers and harbours around the coast. As the Sinn Féin spokesperson, I continue to talk to fishermen every day of my life. I have appealed to the Minister again and again to listen to our fishing communities. Like me, he is from the Inishowen peninsula and is surrounded by piers and harbours. He is in the perfect position to be briefed and advised by them. From the Inishowen peninsula round the west of Donegal down to Killybegs and right round our coast, it is the Minister's responsibility to act on what they are telling us. What they are telling us is that they are staring out at the Irish exclusive economic zone, which stretches out for 200 miles in front of them. It is a huge resource and a potential creator of wealth and jobs for those fishing and coastal communities. However, due to the failures of our Government over the years in the Common Fisheries Policy, we have not seen the proper return of our own natural resource that is right in front of us. The Minister knows that from the community he is from in the Inishowen peninsula. That has been a profound failure. I want to emphasise the very important comments that Deputy Collins made. None of us is buying into the idea of divide and conquer. I was given good advice from a fisherman in the west of Ireland when I started as the Sinn Féin spokesperson on fisheries and the marine. He advised me to be careful not to buy into the idea of big versus small fishermen and divide and conquer. He told me to fight for all of them and do what is right and fair by all of them, so I support the exclusion of larger boats from the six-mile limit. I support a fairer share of mackerel, herring, spurdog and, indeed, arguably exclusively bluefin tuna if we can ever get one bloody fish to take back, rather than having to release it again. I ask the Minister to think about it. Bluefin tuna is the one of most lucrative, if not the most lucrative, species of fish in the world today. It is now accepted by the Marine Institute and the Department that it is in abundance in our waters, yet Irish fishermen have to catch and release. They take tourists out, catch the fish, which is, by the way, feeding on our own fish, and release it. It is a predatory fish. It gets fattened up. All the countries of Europe and the world are catching these fish within our exclusive economic zone, and outside in international waters after they have been fattened here. We have not even got one fish. The allocation to the EU of bluefin tuna increased by something like 75% in recent years because the species is doing well again, but we can only catch them on a rod and release them. Imagine the extra wealth that could bring to inshore fishermen. There is over-reliance on crab, lobster and other shellfish. Having to rely on them is not going to be a future for our inshore fishermen. The Minister knows that and has been told that.  I want to welcome some good news. I will be fair with these points. The spurdog issue was a crucial one. Everywhere I went, particularly in meeting the inshore fleet on the smaller piers right down the west of Ireland and round into the south east, mention was made of getting access to spurdog. It is good and welcome news that that quota has been secured. I ask for more of that. I want to welcome the fact that the National Inshore Fisherman's Association, NIFA, is now a producer organisation. That is welcome, but I am going to throw a challenge back to the Minister. It is really important that we include the islands in this motion. We must stand up for the fishermen of the islands. We must take the island and inshore fishermen all together. As the Minister knows, the island fishermen and the inshore fishermen now have producer organisations. Now that they both have producer organisations, it is critical that they have a place at the table because mackerel and herring quota are public quota and they need to have a fair share. Killybegs has built up a pelagic industry through hard work over many years. We have to fight for the fair share of pelagic fish. The Minister is aware of the issue with blue whiting and I believe he has been working with the industry on that. I am very critical of the failure of the Government over decades now. The words used by Deputy Nolan are very strong ones, but I must say that if we speak to fishermen, that is how they feel and those are the words they use. I am sorry to say it, but those are the words they use about the Department. They are really angry. They call it the ""Department Against the Marine"". The Minister is from a fishing community in Inishowen. I believe that some of the things he has done recently are very welcome, but we have to do more. The Minister has people in his party and from his party in the recent past in Donegal who are passionate about the fishing industry, who would be brilliant people to advise him. The Minister should listen to them. Perhaps he is starting to listen to them because there is some positive stuff happening here. As long as the Minister takes positive actions and fights for fishermen, he will have my support and the support of the Deputies present. However, if we continue to see a Department that is against the marine, that fails people in the way that it has, then we will stand up and challenge the Government. We will repeat the language that we hear in our communities. It is our job to listen to what is happening out there and to hold Government to account and to ask it to do what is right.  The final issue that I want to touch on is that of fuel. The Government failed to provide financial support to the fishing industry that was severely impacted by the fuel crisis. The Minister said that the industry had the tie up scheme. That was totally wrong, because the scheme was about providing support for the loss of quota as a result of Brexit, a totally separate issue. The industry was getting supports for the loss of quota. The inshore fleet had no tie up scheme. It got no financial supports whatsoever throughout this period of huge challenge. As we outlined in our alternative budget, I support the provision of a financial allocation, particularly from the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, EMFAF. That is European money that is available. I understand that as we speak, there is €5 million sitting there to be allocated. I appeal to the Minister again to support the proposition, as outlined, for the allocation of €12 million from a range of different sources, including European funding, directly to the industry. The inshore industry in particular got no supports, but the overall industry needs supports too. The Minister started off his speech by talking about what surrounds him and the piers and how they have influenced him. I am asking him, in his final period in government, to continue with some of the welcome measures announced in recent days, to stand up for inshore fishermen and all fishermen, and to get what is fair for our country in the EU."	spk_37

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-12-15	dail	33	Defects in Apartments - Working Group to Examine Defects in Housing Report: Statements	dbsect_34	As this is an important debate with implications for thousands of families across the State, I fail to understand why there is not even a Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage present to hear what we have to say. I ask the present Minister of State, who is at the Department of Justice, to ensure Ministers read back the transcript of what we are about to say. In particular, my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, should do so. It is important he hears what I have to say. On the background to the defective blocks in Donegal and the west of Ireland, as many as 13 or 14 counties are affected. I can speak with great authority about my home county of Donegal. I live in Buncrana on the Inishowen Peninsula. It is the epicentre of an absolute disaster caused by the utter failure in regulation of the construction sector. People have been left utterly traumatised and devastated by all this. After many years of campaigning and trying to get to the truth of what happened, the Government of the day came up with a 90:10 scheme. People wanted to give this a chance; it was better than nothing. That scheme has become utterly discredited. On the back of that, the people of Donegal and Mayo rose up. That culminated a year ago in 20,000 people marching in this city to demand justice and a scheme that would allow them to rebuild their lives. The Government said that would happen. The months dragged on but then in July of this year, it finally came up with the updated scheme. The homeowners were engaging in good faith and it looked like the issues they were asking be addressed would be. The proposals were entirely reasonable and many would cost nothing to the State, but they were left out of the scheme. We then forced some degree of pre-legislative scrutiny at the housing committee. Limited as it was, at least it was something. It was a day of scrutiny. Then there were all the amendments. There were 80 amendments for the homeowners but all put forward by the Opposition were turned down. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, challenged my party on what legislation we had brought in and what amendments. Did he not pay any attention? He was not present, did not pay any attention to the pre-legislative scrutiny and did not listen to the concerns of the homeowners. When it came to actual legislation coming through here he did not seem to contribute a whole pile. He made a bit of a speech. Did he not witness the Opposition collectively putting forward 80 separate amendments on behalf of the homeowners? Those are the amendments he was looking for. He asks now about Sinn Féin publishing amending legislation. For his information, we will be working with homeowners. Maybe he does not understand the legislative process but when legislation is passed, it takes six months for amendments to that legislation to be accepted by these Houses. Those six months will have passed in mid-January. After mid-January, we will introduce legislation to amend the Government legislation, which still has not been enacted by the way. We will introduce that in co-operation with the families and we will go back at those issues again because we believe this updated scheme is entirely flawed when it comes to bringing justice and 100% redress to our people. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has challenged us on that issue. I am sorry he did not pay attention back in July to the debate that took place. He did not listen to the homeowners or follow their amendments. We are going to bring them back in again in mid-January, if he is so concerned. I hope he can support this and finally get behind the people of Donegal and do what is right by them when the opportunity comes again. I wanted to put all that on record because I want all the homeowners affected by defective apartments who were in the Gallery recently to learn from what happened to us in Donegal and those in Mayo. They should know when you are engaging in good faith in a process you could be betrayed in a moment's time. They should learn from our experience to ensure that all the i's are dotted and all the t's are crossed. People are entitled to 100% redress. No matter where you live in this State, if you are a victim of pyrite, defective blocks or of the cowboys who built houses during the Celtic tiger for pure greed, you are entitled to justice and to 100% redress. Do not accept assurances. Check everything and get it right. I tell the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy James Browne, that we will be back come January and we will try again to make the Government do what is right by the victims of this utter travesty and scandal.	spk_262
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-12-13	dail	33	Confidence in Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage: Motion	dbsect_14	I have no confidence in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in government to tackle the housing crisis. For ten years, from 2011 to 2021, we have had a lost decade in my home county of Donegal. There has been almost zero public housing built on public lands. Instead, the Government forces thousands of families into private rental accommodation and, of course, that takes us to a very significant increase in the cost of rent in Donegal which people just cannot afford. Families are emigrating to Australia and Canada, not because they do not have work but because they cannot afford to put a roof over their heads. The dream of owning their own homes is not attainable. That is the story throughout all of Ireland and is not unique to Donegal. What makes this worse is the defective concrete blocks crisis. We have a perfect storm in Donegal. We have all of the elements of the housing crisis we have in the rest of the State, and then this defective blocks crisis. The Minister knows very well these families had to have an uprising after the disgraceful and discredited 90-10 scheme. Twice they came to Dublin in very significant numbers, where 20,000 were estimated to be present at the second protest. These were very significant numbers from Donegal, Mayo, Clare and the west. The responsibility was on the Minister and his Government to deliver a scheme that gave them justice. These are traumatised families, people whose lives have been destroyed and who are victims of the scandalous system of regulation of the construction industry in this country. They are victims. I will never forget the campaigners in the Public Gallery last July. They were absolutely distraught. They were betrayed. They had engaged in good faith with the Government to arrive at a scheme which was just and fair. They wanted 100% redress. They had proposals that would have cost the Government and the State nothing and which made complete sense. They had 80 amendments but the Minister ran the legislation through because he said it was urgent to have a scheme which people could work with. Here we are now, almost at Christmas, and we still do not have a scheme and it is still not in place. What we have, however, is the spectacle of a Government party Senator making completely outrageous comments in the other House last week, attacking the traumatised families and the victims and talking about a good scheme which nobody in Donegal believes in. It is no wonder, when you hear his comments, that we can see the failure of the Government. It is not just a matter of the Minister himself. I have no confidence in Fine Gael and in Fianna Fáil to do what is right by our people when it comes to housing based on lived experience.	spk_271

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-12-07	dail	33	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_14	I will address the theme that is my responsibility as Sinn Féin's spokesperson on fisheries and the marine, that being, the allocation of quota to the Irish fishing industry from our exclusive economic zone, EEZ, under the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP. There is an ongoing crisis in the fishing industry around our coasts. Since it is almost a perennial crisis, it can sometimes be dismissed or brushed aside. We have an immense resource off our coasts. In the EU, only three member states are island states, those being, Ireland, Cyprus and Malta. In the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, there are two Ministers of State, but not one of them focuses on fisheries and the marine, and it shows. Norway, which is not an EU member state, is looking for increased access to our waters to catch an even greater share of blue whiting. According to scientific studies, blue whiting stocks are in a healthy state. They represent a significant and vital resource for the Irish fishing industry. Currently, we get a quota of 3% of the blue whiting species in our own waters while Norway gets 18%, or six times more. Norway is now negotiating for even more. If this is accepted by our Government, I am told that it will be the final nail in our fishing industry's coffin. That is how serious the situation is. There must be an increased quota of blue whiting for the Irish fishing industry. If the above is not bad enough, Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands have unilaterally increased their share of the mackerel quota. They have not based this move on any science. In some cases, they have built an industry where there was none previously. Mackerel is a migratory species. They spawn off the south west of Ireland and work their way up to those waters. They do not belong in any particular waters. We can agree a sensible way to share them. No agreement has been made between the EU and these three countries, which are not members of the EU or covered by the CFP. We are trading with them, yet there are no repercussions, particularly for Norway. I have great admiration for Norway and do not wish to speak critically of its people. In many ways, they have done great things, but they are out of order when it comes to fisheries. The EU is not standing up for Irish interests. We lost a large volume of our fisheries after Brexit. There was not a fair burden sharing. We were shafted. We will be down to one third of our fishing fleet soon. I will have a chance to speak with the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, later. Please, we need to sort out this issue. It is a serious threat to our industry.	spk_165

I live in Buncrana on the Inishowen Peninsula. People's lives have been utterly destroyed. Hardly anybody my age who has built or bought a home or was living in a council home has not been devastated by the crisis. No matter where people live in Ireland, whether in Dublin and north Leinster in regard to the pyrite scheme, in communities in this city and throughout Ireland that have been affected by defects or a lack of oversight of the building industry and self-certification, self-regulation, no regulation or light-touch regulation, or in the west where there are victims of defective concrete blocks, although as many as 13 or 14 counties could be affected, the State must deliver 100% redress because these people have done nothing wrong. In good faith, these people engaged in the social contract, whereby you get an education or training, get a job, work hard and build a home, you put your trust in the professionals that your home will be tip-top, you pay your mortgage for however many years and you have a home when you are older. That contract was torn up. Deputy Ó Broin and I spent three hours today at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage discussing the issue of quarries and the lack of regulation. My message to the people in the Gallery is that no matter where they are from in Ireland, if they are victims of the utter failure of this State to regulate and hold these people to account, then they need 100% redress. It is as simple as that. That is natural justice. Everybody, no matter where they live, deserves that.	spk_157

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-11-22	dail	33	Declaration of a Housing Emergency: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	I repeat the comments of Deputy Patricia Ryan. We are disappointed the Minister did not stay for the entire debate. This is a profound emergency across the State and the Minister who is responsible to this Oireachtas for housing did not stay more than half an hour so he was not here to listen to Members for an hour and a half. I appreciate the Minister of State being here and perhaps he can convey what I am about to say directly to the Minister when he speaks to him. It is about the emergency in Donegal, the west of Ireland and possibly 13 or 14 counties caused by defective blocks. A major conference was held in Donegal last week attended by experts from Canada, the US, Norway, Switzerland and the UK who examined the laboratory tests of blocks from Donegal and diagnosed what is really happening. It is their expert opinion that pyrrhotite, which is an iron sulfide, is the actual cause of what is happening even though European regulations have been in place for about 20 years and the damage iron sulfides can do if they are not regulated properly in quarries is known internationally. This crisis and the responsibility of the Government and the State for it are worse than we understood originally. It is getting worse. I ask the Minister of State to discuss what I am about to discuss with the Minister tomorrow. This State needs to ensure the testing of foundations. In the state of Connecticut in the US, pyrrhotite in foundations has led to a major initiative where the foundations of hundreds of homes had to be removed. We need to test the foundations of homes now. That is the clear scientific advice from these experts. The Government has put in place a scheme that does not provide for the testing of foundations, which is incredible, even when there was testimony and evidence presented at the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage as part of the legislation passed earlier this year. Even then, it still has not been agreed to. The Government is potentially wasting millions of euro of taxpayers' money where it could be asking people to rebuild their homes on foundations that are not stable. If in doubt, test the foundations. That is the clear advice of these experts and I am appealing for this to happen. Dr. Andreas Leemann, an internationally renowned expert from Switzerland, visited the home of Sharon Moss, which is one of the affected homes in Donegal. I have been in that house too. You would not ask any human being or animal to live in a house such as this. There is black mould on all of the internal walls that interact with the external walls all around the house. After 20 minutes, Dr. Leemann said he was coughing and we expect human beings to live there. Animals should not be living in a house like this never mind human beings. This family is stuck. It cannot get financial assistance to relocate. This brings me to my next point. I am begging the Minister of State. For God's sake, how can we allow dozens of families to live in homes that are not fit for human habitation? How many weeks do I have to come into this Chamber and beg Ministers to intervene and to get the Housing Agency and Donegal County Council to meet these families and get them out now?Why is the Government forcing families to live in houses with black mould strangling them and their kids? Why is the Government doing this? Why is it asking families to live where masonry could fall on top of them at any minute? It is only the mercy of God that it has not happened already. This is an emergency now in Ireland. It is an earthquake happening in slow motion. I beg the Government to undertake an initiative to get these families out of these homes. Will it take us being shamed? International experts toured these houses last week. They appeared on RTÉ and said this was the worst example they have seen in the world. The US, Canada, Norway, Switzerland and the UK, all these countries, have experienced this problem, but the worst experience is here. Will the Government please get this sorted? Whatever about the wider housing emergency, will the Government intervene as soon as possible here, talk to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and get this sorted out?	spk_415
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-11-15	dail	33	 Retained Firefighters: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	Last week, the Dáil heard statements after the tragedy at Creeslough. Our fire services in Donegal were called to respond to that, as were fire services from across the Border. Over the years of road tragedies, and one example I am thinking of was in Inishowen, where eight people lost their lives in one incident, we called the fire service to respond. When there was a tragedy in my town of Buncrana where a family drowned on our pier, it was the fire services who were at the pier side. That is what we ask them to do. It is an incredibly demanding and traumatic job. I remember a member of the fire service in Donegal told me he attended a road traffic accident where there was loss of life. It came into his head that perhaps his son might be among them but he just got on with the job. He was one of the fortunate families who did not get bad news but that is what we ask them to do. That is what we ask of our fire service. The motion is about getting to the point as soon as we can where we have a fire service that is fit for purpose and where the issue of pay and conditions is addressed once and for all. It is about not putting impossible demands on them. As politicians in the Dáil and throughout the country, we thank them again and again. This is about substance. It is about making sure fire service personnel get what they deserve once and for all for representing us. That is what this is about. I commend the fire service personnel who are here today to protest. They are in the Public Gallery. I hope the Government does the right thing and that we will work together cross-party to solve this problem once and for all.	spk_268

They are living in defective block homes that are not fit for human habitation. The Taoiseach and Minister must have seen some of the images on social media and on TG4 last night. These houses are not fit for human habitation. I appeal to them to either release the €15,000 to allow these homeowners to find alternative accommodation or allow modular high-quality housing to be built on different sites. It will be a huge problem - Deputy Pringle referred to it - that families will go through the scheme, please God, in the near future, but will not have alternative homes while their houses are being rebuilt.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-11-08	dail	33	Creeslough, County Donegal: Statements	dbsect_7	We all remember where we were when we first heard news of the tragedy in Creeslough. As the hours moved on, we started to hear indications that there was significant loss of life. Then the full horror was revealed. The nation and, obviously, the people of Donegal knew the number of people who had lost their lives, but then we heard their stories and we moved through the wakes and the funerals over one of the most solemn weeks I can ever remember. It was, however, deeply humbling because in the worst, most unimaginable tragedy that could happen, an appalling and horrific tragedy, the best of people was brought out. Sometimes the worst possible thing that can happen brings out the very best in people. We witnessed the love and solidarity of the immediate community, the wider county of Donegal, our nation and our diaspora - good people all around the world. I will never forget that kindness. I pay tribute to the unbelievable heroism of the local community. They were the very first on the scene and, with no thought for their own safety, showed the instinct to try to save lives and to go in to remove rubble. What started with a handful of people quickly became hundreds working as a team to remove the rubble. Then the digger driver, with incredible dedication and skill, took away the heavy masonry. The people did everything they could to try to save lives in the most horrendous of circumstances. I pay tribute to the emergency services, the fire and rescue services from both sides of the Border, the ambulance service, the Garda, our hospital staff and Donegal County Council. I am sure there were others. Of course, our wider health and mental health services have been there for the community. They need to be there continually now. I know they have said they will be there for as long as people need them. I repeat the call Fr. John Joe Duffy made in recent days for people to avail of those services, to talk about what has happened and to get the support they will need. I pay tribute to Fr. Brian Ó Fearraigh and Fr. Michael Carney, who took responsibility for two of the masses. They were a tremendous support in those two cases to the O'Flaherty and Harper families. Fr. John Joe Duffy has been and continues to be an incredible support to his community. The eulogies he delivered at the various funerals told a story of a man who is at the heart of his community and who has a love and compassion for his community that is inspirational. He and his team will need support moving forward. Bishop McGuckian should be given great praise for his tremendous support, quietly supporting Fr. John Joe in particular throughout the week. I am sure he will continue to do so, together with all the priests from the surrounding parishes. At times we have had to criticise the church in this State, and rightly so, but where there are priests behaving like they did and giving the support they gave, that is worthy of support and admiration. To have see that at close hand over that week was an absolute privilege. As for the next steps, the community will need supports in the form of mental and physical infrastructure. We need to restore the buildings, get people back in their jobs, get people back in their homes and build community facilities. It is the best tribute we can pay to those who lost their lives.	spk_88

The Government said it was doing this because it wanted to get on urgently with introducing a scheme that could work for the families. Today I put it to the Minister of State that some 500 home-owning families are stuck in stage 1. They cannot get access to financial supports. They are stuck in dangerous homes. In some cases these homes are just not fit for human habitation. If the Minister of State could see them himself there is no way he would expect any family to live in some of these homes. There is a real sense of abandonment. There is a sense that the Government has pulled off a con and that they told the rest of the country that the protests and the stories that we hear, that cause us so much concern, are all sorted now, that the Government signed the cheques and it is all okay. It is far from okay. There are huge numbers of families, from Donegal right down the west coast, who are trapped in despair. We must remember that it is almost three years ago that the Minister announced the first scheme. This became a discredited scheme, which was the so-called ""90:10"" scheme. It dragged on and on. Then there was this new scheme, which is very limited also. We will introduce amending legislation through our spokesperson Deputy Eoin Ó Broin.I cannot for the life of me understand why the Minister of State will not task the housing agency and local authorities, be they in Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Limerick and, soon, it is hoped, Sligo and other counties, with assisting families stuck in homes that are not fit for human habitation. How can he force families to remain in those homes this winter? Why is he not helping them find temporary alternative accommodation and paying for it? Do they have to pay for a mortgage and find temporary accommodation which is just not there? Why is he not looking at high-quality modular housing? These things pit one set of people against another and it is wrong. There are solutions for everybody but the Minister of State is making a hames of the whole lot. Please help the families in these dangerous homes, urgently."	spk_23

As the Minister of State is aware, we have an exclusive economic zone, as do all coastal countries, of 200 miles. It is estimated that we get approximately 15% to 20% of the fish in the waters of our exclusive economic zone, which are among the richest waters in the European Union. Outside of the Common Fisheries Policy, can Members imagine any self-respecting country in the world accepting such a proportion of the wealth in its seas? This precious resource should create wealth and jobs in coastal communities if we fish sustainably. One of the features of the Common Fisheries Policy is that there is generally sustainable fishing and proper oversight of what is happening at sea, which is sadly not the case in many other parts of the world. We need to fish sustainably. We need to get a balance of fish for our inshore and offshore fishermen. That has not been attained. It is shocking that even after Brexit, when we lost another 15% of the terrible share we had, that was not given back. We got a redundancy payment called the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, which is now being used to invest in piers and harbours and decommission 60 vessels. What will that mean? I ask the Minister of State to remember this shocking statistic. Our whitefish fleet will soon be one third of the size it was in 2005. The potential of fishing in our coastal communities is being destroyed and we are not putting up a proper fight. The world is not being told of the injustice that is occurring. If we fought hard, that injustice could not be sustained because it is so profound. The latest development tells me everything about whoever runs the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, or the Department against the marine. How can it be that every single fishing organisation in this State, from those representing local community groups and island and inshore fishermen to the co-operatives and producer organisations, has appealed and begged for financial assistance? Such assistance is being provided by almost every other European member state with a coastal fishing community. We have not done so and fishermen literally cannot afford to go to sea. We have a disgraceful share of our fish, the impact of Brexit and we now have this. I appeal to the Minister of State, with his colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, to stand up for fishing in coastal communities in Europe and Ireland and confront the people in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who are blocking doing what is right by our fishing communities.	spk_242

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-10-04	dail	33	Defective Concrete Products Levy: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_13	On numerous occasions, I have engaged with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the role of the banks in contributing towards redress for the affected families in this scandal. I recall one exchange with the Minister for Finance when the Dáil was sitting in the Convention Centre Dublin when he looked puzzled that banks, the mortgage lenders whose assets would be reduced to zero with houses impacted by defective blocks, would have their assets restored to full market value with the help of the State and that the banks were not being asked to play any role in any of it. Worse than that, they were not making a financial contribution. They have not assisted families with restructuring their loans or even writing down debt. I can speak with authority only about my own county, Donegal. The role of the banks there has been absolutely shameful. Right up to this moment, families who have needed help from their banks to navigate this crisis to rebuild their lives have not been helped, yet the Government is not proposing a levy on the banking sector to assist in this crisis. He is not even asking the banks to help the families affected, based on a recent response I got from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. That is just shocking. Consider the pyrite scandals that have affected families in north Leinster and Dublin, and also the defective block crisis, which concerns pyrrhotite, mica and pyrite in counties in the west and a growing number of other counties. It is estimated that 13 or 14 counties are now affected. We must also consider the tens of thousands of people in houses, apartments and duplexes who were failed by the Celtic tiger owing to greed, recklessness and the consequent defects. Not one person has been brought to account, and not one cent has been taken from the people who delivered the misery all across the country. Nobody has been brought to book. The Minister said last October that he would appoint a senior counsel to look at a public inquiry to learn the lessons from these scandals. A recent response I got to a parliamentary question states the Minister has not only not appointed a senior counsel but that he has not even provided the terms of reference. I talked to campaigners in Donegal in recent days and noted they had not been consulted on terms of reference. Can Members imagine any other country tolerating such a devastating impact on so many families, costing the taxpayer billions of euro and with nobody brought to book or held to account? Not even a senior counsel has been appointed and no terms of reference have been provided. For God's sake, does the Government not understand the hurt and devastation that people have gone through all across this country, in almost every county, because of the greed and recklessness and the relationship between builders, manufacturers and those who were in government throughout all the years in question? It gets even worse. At a meeting of the housing committee in July, we listened to evidence from the experts on the legislation the Government was introducing. We learned from them that, right now, there are quarries that are continuing to manufacture defective concrete blocks. For Christ's sake, it is happening even as we speak. The Minister talks about the billions that remediation would cost the taxpayer and everything that has to be done but he is still allowing quarries to manufacture defective concrete blocks. There is no accountability or contribution, and this still goes on today. In this debate and in response to the bad decision the Government has made on the concrete levy, I have been asked to plead with the Government to demonstrate by its actions that it will have zero tolerance for the recklessness in question, which has destroyed people's lives, will hold those responsible to account, end the misery delivered to people and afford to the latter 100% redress no matter where they live in this State. This is the opportunity tonight. It is not just about this foolish concrete levy; it is also about showing people that what happened will never happen again and that the taxpayer will not be exposed. Moreover, it is about showing that families will not have their lives destroyed. That is my plea tonight. The Minister should finally deal with the banks.	spk_243

They explained how they could not afford to go out to sea and how other European member states had intervened, such as France, Spain, Sweden - I could go on. For whatever reason, however, the Minister and his Government have failed to intervene to provide emergency financial supports to the fishing industry. Representatives met him again in recent days and, I have to say, I am shocked a rescue package for our fishing industry was not announced in the budget. I cannot figure it out for the life of me. The Minister put out a statement through his officials that is utter spin. He announced a record investment in coastal communities, yet he knows that about two thirds of that comprises European Brexit funding to compensate for the loss of quota. The Government is actually dropping investment, therefore, from the central Exchequer into fishing and coastal communities and has refused to provide an emergency budget for fishermen. Fisheries both on the islands and inshore, along with every producer organisation, co-operative and fishing or seafood organisation in this State, have united to say this is an unprecedented crisis and to highlight that it has been one thing after another with the lack of quota, Brexit and now this fuel crisis. I am taking this opportunity to again appeal to the Minister to please put together an emergency package. In our alternative budget, we outlined how the Government could use the European funds that are there or central Exchequer funding. Like me, he comes from a community that is surrounded by water and fishing communities. This is something he should know instinctively. He has met these people face to face and seen the whites of their eyes, and he knows the issue. I appeal to him, or to his officials or whoever is blocking this, to please stand for up for his communities and ensure there will be an emergency financial package to bail out our fishing and coastal communities. Leaving aside politics, as two people from Donegal with fishing communities around us, this has to be sorted out.	spk_310

If one looks at the league table of European countries and what they have provided to their people as a percentage of GDP, Ireland is right there at the bottom of the list. Only Denmark is worse. This is just a shameful response to an unprecedented energy crisis that our people face, be it home heating oil, solid fuels, or petrol or diesel for their cars. Wherever they turn, for businesses, for workers or for families, this has had a crippling burden on them. The Government's strategy has been to wait until the winter and put something on the table then. What Sinn Féin has put before the Minister must be implemented.It would cut and cap electricity charges to the levels prior to this crisis and there would be direct, targeted payments for those who most need them. There are issues around child benefit and there is also the need to address the rent crisis due to the Government's shambolic management of our housing system. This Government has been appalling in its response to the energy crisis. It is at the bottom of the European league table. Centre-right politicians across Europe are ahead of the Government when it comes to the taxes that are required - the windfall taxes on the companies.

The view is that the Minister would be denying people. In my Second Stage speech I spoke of the famous ""gimlet eye"" - as referred to by former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny. This mindset is that you would deny people the ability to build a house, God forbid, with triple glazing and modern energy efficiency standards. Again, it is about penny-pinching. We know what penny-pinching did with the last scheme. It ended up costing the taxpayer a fortune of money because the Government got it so badly wrong. This is why we asked for a lengthy period of scrutiny in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to try to make sure the Government gets this right so it does not have to revisit the scheme and cost the taxpayer even more money by its folly. The issue around the foundations is crucial. Deputy Ó Broin is right. I believe that the NSAI panel got it wrong with IS 465. The panel did not allow for the testing of foundations. They did not allow for the testing for pyrrhotite, which is emerging as the main offender now, with other deleterious materials. The problem is that they got it wrong with IS 465. The people who got it wrong are now reviewing their own mistakes. There does not appear to be any international peer review and there is no deadline. The Minister is going to roll out legislation that is really flawed. The appeal from Deputy Ó Broin, and I am sure from all colleagues here, is to include and provide for foundations now. We know of the phrase, ""If in doubt, leave it out"". If there is any doubt about the foundations, do not make people build houses on dodgy foundations."	spk_240

I just cannot emphasis strongly enough that it is madness to put forward, as the Minister said, billions of taxpayers’ money and base it on what is a flawed standard, namely, IS 465. Already there have been tests carried out by Petrolab in Britain. There have been examinations by Dr. Andreas Leeman, who is a highly respected international expert. There is absolute clear scientific evidence that IS 465 is not up to the standard required to invest billions of taxpayers’ money. Why on earth would the Minister start this scheme without making sure that we have clear feedback from the NSAI in terms of the review that the Minister has given it the terms of reference for? The other point is that the NSAI, as confirmed to me in recent days, has exactly the same panel, including strong industry input from the construction and concrete industry. The very people who designed IS 465 are the people who created this disaster. Let me repeat that for the record. The very people who are advising the NSAI on IS 465 and this review are the people who created this disaster for thousands of families around this country. They should be taken off from that review immediately. Anybody involved in the construction or concrete industry should not provide input to that review. There are plenty of international experts who can do that. There are plenty of laboratories around the world and there is plenty of international best practice. I ask the Minister to urgently intervene with this review and make sure that the people who are doing it are actual experts independent of the industry and it based on best international practice, before he goes spending billions of taxpayers’ money.All the families in the Gallery are asking for is for this to be done prudently and sensibly, based on up-to-date international practice and science.

He said: ""... the Vatican's reaction was to parse and analyse it with the gimlet eye of a canon lawyer."" That was a famous speech. The problem has been that the approach of too many people who worked for Government and who were elected to be in government over the years who were dealing with the victims of this disaster, which has worked its way down the west coast of Ireland, has been exactly the same. It has been cold and callous, has always been about limiting the exposure of the State and penny-pinching but has ended up costing us a fortune because of the mistakes those involved have made again and again. That was a powerful contribution, incidentally, by Deputy Alan Farrell just now. We are looking for all of the victims of State regulation to be treated exactly the same across this State, whether it is the people who live in apartments with defects in Dublin, the victims of the pyrite disaster in Dublin and north Leinster, the people on the west coast or those in the counties we heard about, such as Wexford, for example, where problems are emerging. We want them all to receive 100% support, and not the gimlet eye again and again. They want redress and to rebuild their homes. That is all they are asking for. They were utterly failed by the State, its building controls, the regulations, the lack of oversight, the Celtic tiger, the greed and the closeness of those who were greedy to people who have sat in this Chamber over the years. We owe it to any homeowners and families who are the victims of this disaster and injustice to get them 100% redress. That is the starting point in all of these matters. If one starts from that point, one gets to justice. If one does not, one gets injustice again and again. IS 465 is the basis for the spending billions of euros of taxpayers' money. IS 465 does not instruct us to test for pyrrhotite or to test the foundations of people's homes. How can that be? When the evidence the committee produced last Thursday is looked at, there is no answer to that question. How can that be the case? In Donegal alone, 77 properties were tested and 66 had pyrrhotite. Some 61 of those had appreciable amounts of pyrrhotite. Pyrrhotite is, in fact, the chief offender here. More tests have been done by Petrolab in Britain.Pyrrhotite is the chief offender, yet we are not testing or basing the expenditure of billions of euro of taxpayers' money on that. It is not a deciding factor. We are not testing the foundations to make sure they are safe. We are cruelly insisting that people rebuild their homes on foundations that have not been tested. The Government talks about the use of taxpayers' money. It is reckless behaviour again and again because it is always about the gimlet eye. It is always about not starting from the position of 100% redress or from a position of justice to remedy what is a profound injustice and disaster for so many people. The IS 465 standard is being reviewed. It is clear from the science that is emerging that there needs to be a complete transformation in a renewed standard. That has to happen in tandem with this legislation and this new scheme. How can the Government ask people to trust a system that has been shown by science, by laboratories and by internationally respected experts to be nonsense? The Government is going to risk billions of euro of taxpayers' money on a discredited standard that was not based on any discernible level of testing at the time. That was a mistake. The people who are working on that standard need to bring in new ideas and international best practice. They need to talk to Petrolab, Dr. Andreas Leemann and other international experts in these fields in the United States and Britain. They need to have the humility to know that the standard we are working with right now is not up to specification. It is not worth risking billions of euro of people's money on. We cruelly ask people to keep their foundations. There is a big suspicion that I share, which is about - I will say it again - the gimlet eye. If a person replaces the foundations and goes for a full rebuild, it must be rebuilt to modern building standards. God forbid the Government would allow people, when we talk about retrofitting and climate change, to put in triple glazing and modern energy-efficient systems when they rebuild their homes. Is it too much to ask that we would allow them to do that? Not even that can be allowed to happen. We want people to use the same windows and doors they already had and build homes on old foundations that have not been tested. This is the recklessness and mean-spiritedness that keeps breaking people’s hearts and it has to stop. I will speak about penalty-free downsizing. How on earth can the Government stop somebody who is willing to downsize their home from doing so? It has said it will not give people 100% redress or make sure the costings are immediately updated when the scheme is launched. It has said it cannot give that commitment just now, although that should have been done already. Not only will the Government not do that but it will also not allow people to downsize their houses penalty-free - the cruelty of it. People have been traumatised by years of this mental anguish and turmoil. Lives have been destroyed. The Government wants them to build on foundations that have not been tested. It wants them to use windows and doors that are old. It will give them a financial penalty if they choose to downsize. For God's sake, get this right this time. Do not make the mistakes - the gimlet eye - that led to the so-called 90:10 scheme, a cruel scheme that has now been discredited by all. We have to get it right this time. The final issue I will focus on is the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland costing. The Government came in again. I use the word “again” because I am speaking to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, about the words of his former party leader and former Taoiseach. The gimlet eye comes into the way the Government approaches the costings with a sliding scale. Where the hell did the sliding scale come from? They were looking for a big day but - imagine the cruelty when people had their hopes raised - all of a sudden the sliding scale was slipped in. Then, under huge pressure from homeowners across the country, the Government went back and looked at the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland and said it would not give a commitment just yet. Maybe it will give a commitment next week that when this scheme is up and running, it will be based on real costs in the real world whereby the amount per square foot or per square metre is actually what people would have to pay in the real world. Will the Minister of State at least give that commitment when the scheme is up and running? That is the appeal. This is my final contribution. A chartered engineer gave testimony before a committee last week that there are quarries still producing defective products and ruining people's lives. How are we in such a situation, after all these years? It is still being allowed to happen. It is still going on in this country. People are still manufacturing blocks that are destroying people's lives. There is still not legislation to bring this to an end. Not one quarry has been closed in this country despite people’s lives being destroyed. The answer was that not one quarry was closed down. I will wrap up with this. I started with the speech by the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, that captured people's imagination about closing an ugly chapter in our history. Please stop using the gimlet eye. Stop the cold-heartedness. Start from the position of natural justice, which means full redress for every family, no matter where they live in this country, who have been failed by the past. Allow them to rebuild their lives. Get it right this time. Base it on science, fairness and justice. If the Government does that, the people can go home and will not have to keep protesting or sitting in the Public Gallery anymore."	spk_174

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-06-21	dail	33	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_14	Three weeks ago, a delegation of fishermen from all around the coast of Ireland went to Brussels and met with the director-general of the European Commission that deals with fisheries, Charlina Vitcheva. That delegation included representatives from six national fishing organisations and two co-ops, one based in Greencastle in north Donegal and the Galway and Aran co-op. We had representatives from right around the coast. It was a powerful delegation and they made the case for our fair share of the fish in Irish waters. At that meeting, we also engaged with the director-general around what supports could be given to the industry to help it deal with the fuel crisis that is going on right now. The fishermen we speak to all around the coast are struggling to go out to water with the increase in fuel costs and the impact that is having on them. They are struggling to make a living as it is because we do not get a fair share of the fish in our waters and now they are struggling with the impact of Brexit due to the loss of even more fish and quota. That is the context in which those fishermen come into this crisis. I am sorry to say to the Minister of State that even though in the likes of France and Spain there have been significant interventions to support the fishing industries there and considerable supports have been given to them, nothing additional has been given to our fishing community in Ireland. There is the Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR, fund, which comprises money given to Ireland to compensate for the further decommissioning of our fleet. We can park that money aside because it comes from the European Union to compensate our fishing communities for the loss of €43 million every year, or €250 million and even more when we add on the knock-on impacts. The real issue is there has been no central Exchequer funding to support our fishing communities, who are on their knees all along the coast, while the French Government and the Spanish Government, and no doubt other governments if we check this further, have given significant supports. The director-general of the European Commission who deals with fisheries, Charlina Vitcheva, has reported that the Commission is waiting on Ireland’s proposals. Nothing has come from Ireland to support our fishing communities. When the Taoiseach attends the Council meeting, will he put forward proposals to help our fishing communities cope with this crisis?	spk_154

The microgeneration scheme has been on the agenda for years and years. Deputy Stanley tried to promote it. It is the most basic form of utilising our resources. It is not done. Obviously, we have optimum capacity for offshore wind energy. Wind energy is not dealt with. Green hydrogen is not dealt with. Electricity infrastructure is not available in rural areas. What does the Government do instead? It has the stick ready at all stages. The reality people face right now is a 50% to 60% increase in the cost of fuel over recent months, which is having a horrendous impact on families. The cost of home heating oil has more than doubled, which is also having a horrendous impact. The reality in which we live is such that people in rural communities such as Donegal now have to use solid fuels, unfortunately, to get by. That is having a horrendous impact. What is the message from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan? Is it to go to the social welfare officer? Christ almighty. ""Slow down"" was his message recently. The Minister of State needs to talk to his senior Minister and tell him that that is deeply offensive and that people are struggling to get by. Those people have been failed by Government policy and do not take kindly to lectures when the Government has not met its responsibilities to deliver energy security and renewable energy. That is why they are left at the mercy of the profiteering conglomerates we see now. It is because of Government failure for so many years. In the here and now, people need help with this. They need an emergency budget to help them deal with this crisis. I dread what is coming in the winter. I dread the stories I hear about the cost increases on home heating oil, coal, petrol and diesel that may be coming. The Government needs to do something now."	spk_42

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-05-25	dail	33	Recent Developments in Northern Ireland: Statements	dbsect_12	Today is the 31st anniversary of the assassination of Councillor Eddie Fullerton. The Minister will be aware I have made a number of speeches in his presence about that case and the Minister is familiar with it. I will focus on the case of Councillor Eddie Fullerton again here today to illustrate what I believe is the serious bad faith by the British Government and the British state and how I think they are trying to protect themselves from accountability and responsibility for their central role in the conflict and in the assassination of an elected representative of the people of Donegal. We know that Operation Greenwich, the Police Ombudsman report, was published earlier this year. That report came after 15 years. It was an exhaustive report that followed from a complaint in 2006 from the Fullerton family. It was a remarkable investigation. I commend those who carried it out. They were honourable people. They themselves were shocked at what they discovered. Indeed, we learn in the report, Operation Greenwich, that they had submitted a file to the PSNI in 2016 with details about a person involved in multiple murders who should be of interest to the PSNI. That person is Person K. I will not name him here today. I will reserve that to a future decision based on the actions of the British state. Person K was a mass murderer. He was clearly a British military agent. He was the person overseeing the assassination of Councillor Fullerton. Other persons involved in Councillor Fullerton's assassination are identified as Person J and Person P in the report. Both Person J and Person P were British soldiers. I believe Person P was a British military agent acting inside the Ulster Defence Association, UDA. What I am saying to the Minister is I believe British military intelligence acting on behalf of the British state directed its agents, including a serving British soldier, to assassinate an elected representative in Donegal 31 years ago today. It could not be more serious than that. I would like to name Person K here today but I am not going to. I may do in time. I have that right under privilege in this House if I believe that justice has not been served. Person K will not be able to hide forever. Person K is a mass murderer. Person K went on to oversee the massacres at Castlerock and Greysteel - the murders of 12 innocent people. He is a psychopath and a mass murderer, a British military agent with a licence to kill. Even after Greysteel, even when a person who was believed to be a police agent was convicted of being involved in Greysteel, he was still protected even though the evidence of his involvement in Greysteel was absolutely overwhelming. One of the persons convicted of Greysteel identified Person K as overseeing the entire operation, from securing the vehicle that was used as the getaway car to providing the weaponry to making sure they practised the route and tested the weapons. He could not have been more involved. When the deed was done, he was not present but he oversaw the entire matter. His fingerprints were caught on a plastic bag with the weapons used in Greysteel in the holdall. Even though a witness, a person involved in the murder, said he was completely involved, even though his fingerprints were found on a plastic bag with the weapons used in Greysteel, a mass murder of eight people, he was not convicted. He will be brought to justice. The problem for the British state is, when he is brought to justice, so will those who gave him the orders, and that goes right up to, I believe, Whitehall and 10 Downing Street. I believe they were carrying out a series of targeted assassinations of republicans from Pat Finucane to Sinn Féin councillors, including Councillor Fullerton. There is even more to it, if that was not enough. It is astonishing. This is all down to the investigation of Operation Greenwich, an astonishing report that I appeal to the officials in the Department to examine in detail. I am happy to meet with them and divulge the information, thanks to the Fullerton family, that we have unveiled. Person J had recently left the British Army just before his involvement in Councillor Fullerton's murder. Person J was found in possession of hundreds of intelligence files on republicans in early 1991 prior to Councillor Fullerton's assassination. Within those files, there were two names that stand out: Sinn Féin Councillor Bernard O'Hagan and Sinn Féin member Mr. Tommy Casey. Both those men would be murdered later on in 1991. Even though Person J, who had left the British Army just before 1991, was out on bail for being in possession of all of those documents, we believe he was involved in the assassinations of Councillor Fullerton, Councillor O'Hagan and Mr. Casey. He was then convicted and sentenced to six months for possession of those files, even though two of the names in the file were subsequently murdered after they were found in early 1991. It is astonishing what has been revealed in this report, beyond what we ourselves even would have thought possible. What one is looking at here is a British military agent who becomes a mass murderer of innocent people, oversees these operations, is protected all the way, is taken away from the scene after the ceasefire and lives a life. Person J and Person K are still alive today. They may think that they can hide from justice; they cannot. I want to send a message to the British state and the British security services that might think they can cover up all of this. We know what they did. We know those who carried out these acts for them. They may try to hide. They might try to close down their Facebook accounts, which these two people and one other person directly involved in the murder have, but they will not hide from justice. The family of the late Councillor Fullerton and the other families will have justice and the British state will tell the full truth about its role in the conflict in the North.	spk_170

We have seen the imagery of the young man in the white t-shirt showing heroism under gunfire from Israeli snipers in rescuing her body. Those images do not lie and it is very clear what happened here. There must be an independent investigation and I agree with my colleague, Deputy Brady, that the International Criminal Court will have to look at it. It has all the hallmarks of an appalling war crime. If that was not bad enough, the imagery from the funeral horrified people across the world. Even in death, they could not allow her dignity or her mourners dignity to bury her in peace. It was absolutely disgusting. This is typical of a regime that is unchallenged and allowed to do as it wants by the international community, including our Government. We cannot even pass a resolution banning the products of illegal settlements, which are defined as war crimes under international law. We do commerce with people involved with war crimes. We cannot even pass legislation on that. We cannot recognise the state of Palestine, despite both Houses asking that we do so. This has led to the actions of the Israeli police force. It is unchallenged internationally and feels it can do anything it wants. Of course, there is also imagery of illegal settlers taking possession of a building in Hebron as the mourners were at the funeral. I do not know what more we can say. I have stood here so many times, as have my colleagues, to speak after witnessing such actions from the Israeli state. B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the UN rapporteur have defined what goes on as apartheid and repugnant to international law but the Government cannot even describe it as apartheid because it is hamstrung with an utterly failed European Union policy. We must speak for ourselves, as we did when South Africa was engaged in apartheid. We took a stand proudly against that regime in the 1980s but will we do it again? Will we have an independent foreign policy that stands up to horrific actions such as those we have seen? The Minister should reflect on that and do the right thing.	spk_96
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-05-18	dail	33	Just Transition: Statements	dbsect_15	I want to outline to the Minister of State why the Minister, his party leader, is so deeply unpopular in rural Ireland and why he is so out of touch with rural Ireland. I want to describe to him the practical realities for people in Donegal. We have a situation whereby two thirds of homeowners in Donegal rely on home heating oil to heat their homes. Even more rely on solid fuel. They heavily rely on these two sources of fuel to heat their homes, particularly in winter. Despite the price of home heating oil increasing by 130%, something that has had a major impact on families in our county and across the west of Ireland, not a single cent worth of help was provided by the Government. Incredibly, the Government instead increased the carbon tax even further this month. Nothing was done to help those families. There are no supports available to help them retrofit their homes. They will have to take out further loans, unless they are lucky enough to have tens of thousands of euro in their savings accounts. There is nothing of real substance at all to help families to heat their homes. Let us look at people who have to work and study in Donegal. The public transport system there is not fit for purpose. It has been under-resourced for years. It is not designed to connect workers with their workplaces. As a result, they have to have cars. Almost everybody who wants to work in Donegal must have a car. Everybody who wants to study in Donegal must also have a car. Time and again I have submitted parliamentary questions to the Green Party leader, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, to ask about electric charging infrastructure in Donegal. There was no urgency. There is nothing being done. If you are a homeowner who needs to heat your home or if you are a motorist who has to have a car filled with petrol or diesel to get by, you do not have alternatives in Donegal, unless you are very wealthy. What does the Government do for these people? It does not give them the carrot; it gives them the stick, every single time. It hits them with a carbon tax again and again and again. It punishes them for choices that they do not have. That is why there is anger. That is why turf was merely the straw that broke the camel’s back. People had enough of the indifference to their plight and the indifference to the reality that they face every day. If the Minister of State wants to know why there is this anger towards the leader of the Green Party and the Minister, that is why. The Minister is totally disconnected and totally out of touch with the reality of people's lives. The Just Transition Alliance is telling the Green Party that it has not put in place a just transition commission. It is not in place. It has no dialogue with the social partners. It has no dialogue with the unions that represent the workers. The Green Party lectures people in rural Ireland about their responsibilities, but it never meets its own. It never meets its own. That is why there is such anger in places like Donegal. It will only grow more and more until the Green Party starts to listen to them and stands by them, rather than giving them the stick every time.	spk_254

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-05-12	dail	33	Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Security: Statements	dbsect_30	I want to start my comments by revisiting the issue of Killybegs and the scandal of how it has been handled. The Minister was at a public meeting there in recent weeks and he saw at first hand the scale of the anger and frustration. That is not just today or yesterday as it has been building up for many years. There has to be a solution to this. What is being asked of our industry, fishermen and fish producers in Killybegs is not asked of anybody else anywhere in Europe. I spoke that night and the Minister will have heard my comments, but I want to put them on the Dáil record so anybody with an interest can understand. As we speak, in Killybegs, in a fish factory that I have seen with my own eyes, when fish are landed to be weighed, in that one factory alone there are ten CCTV cameras trained on the weighing system that belong to and are fully controlled by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, the regulator. SFPA staff can keep an eye while not even leaving their office in Killybegs and they can watch the weighing happening in real time. If they want to be there physically, they can also do that. If they want to go around to the back end of the factory and check the trolleys, and check there is 20 kg in every box and 60 boxes, which is 1.2 tonnes, it is not hard to do. They have cameras trained 24 hours a day and it can be recorded for 31 days. I ask where in Ireland today is there any industry in the private sector that would accept the regulator having eyes on it 24 hours a day. That is what they are willing to accept in Killybegs to address the concerns that may be there. That is what is in place right now. How on earth can our regulator not tell Europe to look at the scale of the oversight we have, which is unimaginable and would not be tolerated anywhere else in Europe? However, that is the scale we have and that is what we have achieved, and that is still not good enough for the SFPA or, indeed, the Government and the Minister to put to the European Commission. The Minister knows in his heart that it is outrageous, even if there was any justification for the concerns, but we have got to the point where even that is not acceptable. We are denied quota so we are denying fish to our own fishermen. These factories would love to be producing fish landed by Irish vessels but they have to keep people at work, so vessels from other countries - from Norway and Denmark – have been landing in recent weeks. They land at the pier and no matter what weighing system they use, there is only a 2% allowance for the water. The Minister can imagine blue whiting that has to be maintained at 30%, 40% or 50% volume of refrigerated water to keep it fresh in order to comply with European food safety regulations. Yet, there is only a 2% allowance for the water even though it is about 30% or 40% water to keep it fresh and safe. The Minister can clearly see that that is madness, whereas it can just be taken up to the factory, where there are ten CCTV cameras trained on it. This is bureaucratic madness and the Minister knows it is wrong, but it is not getting sorted out. To make things worse, rather than turn their fish for human consumption into fish meal, two of the vessels landed in Derry and 40 trailers transported the fish to Killybegs just to make a point. We must remember that the harbour in Derry is designated as a European Union harbour and it is included in the Irish protocol that we are all talking about right now. Our own Irish State agency is now saying to these factories in Killybegs, which were just making a point that this is bureaucratic madness, that their weighing permits are being removed and it is taking their livelihood away from them in real terms because they landed in a harbour “outside of Ireland”. They are suggesting that Derry is outside of Ireland. They are doing the British Conservative party's job for it. They are basically enforcing a hard border and ignoring the protocol that we all fought for. The Minister knows that is the political reality, whatever way they want to phrase it. I state again that there are seven designated harbours in the North of Ireland. My understanding is that 150 landings of fish came through the North to Irish fish producers in the last four months, and some 35% of the seafood that comes into the Twenty-six Counties - the Republic of Ireland - comes through the North. This is the practice. I believe that what is happening is vindictive. I believe the factories that made a stand, stood up for themselves and said they cannot take this anymore, that this is totally unreasonable and would not be seen anywhere in Europe, are being punished for making that stand. The Minister cannot let this continue. I appeal to the Minister and the Taoiseach, who stands over the shared island plan and the shared island unit that is funded and envisioned by him. How on earth can we talk about a shared island when we say that to land fish in Derry is outside of Ireland? We know what is happening here. These factories took a stand. The community in Killybegs took a stand. They said they are not going to be criminalised anymore, they are not going to let themselves be misrepresented and they are not going to destroy their industry. Boats will just turn away if this is the way they are going to be treated and if there is a chance that their catch could be devalued in that way. I am taking all of my speaking time today on this issue. There are so many things I could say about fisheries but I am asking the Minister and the Taoiseach to please intervene with the SFPA to return to common sense and to make sure that the people of the south-west Donegal and Killybegs have a future in the fishing industry. I ask them to please do that as urgently as they can.	spk_435

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-04-27	dail	33	Carbon Tax: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	The reality for people living in the west and north west is that at least two thirds of the homes are heated with home heating oil. The figure is probably higher in County Donegal. Someone looking to fill a tank with 1,000 l of oil would have paid about €600 just over a year ago. Today, that person will pay more than double that. The tank must be filled a number of times every year. When households are already struggling to get by I do not need to explain the impact this is having on families in the rural west and north west. I can speak with absolute clarity about what is happening in Donegal. What has the Government done to assist with that huge burden? Absolutely nothing. We asked it to reduce excise duty on home heating oil but it would not do it. The Government is now insisting on increasing the carbon tax in the next week. That is the context and there is anger in rural Ireland. There has been a significant increase in the price of coal, on which nothing has been done for working families. The final straw has been the issue of turf. This affects 4% of homes, which is a small number. The people affected are often older and living in isolated areas and do not have much money. Turf is the one source of fuel that has not significantly increased in cost, yet now is the time the Government has chosen to go after them. This is after doing nothing for rural families when it came to increases in the prices of home heating oil and, to a lesser albeit significant extent, coal. This is how people heat their homes. The Government has done nothing to give people proper financial assistance to change or engage in retrofitting. There has been nothing in the years since the carbon tax was introduced. The carbon tax was supposed to penalise people who have not changed direction. How can people change direction when they cannot afford to and the infrastructure to do so is not there? Every time, people are given the stick and never the carrot in order to achieve objectives that people agree we need to move towards for the future. That is the problem. It is the cause of the anger in rural Ireland and in counties such as Donegal. The issue of turf, as I say, is the straw that is going to break the camel's back. The Government is going to have to back down on the issue. It will have to reconsider its approach with respect to home heating oil and the imposition of carbon tax increases at the worst possible time.	spk_47

I ask the Minister of State, Deputy O' Donovan, to kindly ensure that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue and, more importantly, his departmental officials are provided with a transcript of what I am about to say because it has major implications for our fishing industry. The Minister of State knows that our industry is in the worst state that it has ever been in, following a number of blows, the first of which was Brexit and the EU, UK trade agreement. This resulted in another huge reduction in quota for Irish fishermen. It is a mortal sin that we have 12% of the waters of all of the European Union but only around 4% of the fish. We actually get about 15% of the fish in our own waters. That is why we are now in a situation where the Government is asking the industry to decommission another 60 vessels. If we compare the situation 15 years ago to today, we will have only one third of the fleet that was over 18 m. This is coupled with the pandemic, the impact on the markets for our industry and the latest disastrous blow which is the huge increase in fuel costs. Incredibly, there has been no real substantive intervention by the Minister to deal with this. Why do I raise all of this now? I raise it because many of the problems we have are due to the fact that access to our fisheries is governed by the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP and Europe is the place to make that fight and get our fair share. What we are doing in this country is punishing fishermen more and more. As we speak, a Norwegian vessel has been forced to land in Derry rather than Killybegs because of a decision of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA regarding the blue whiting on that vessel and on another vessel from Denmark. The whiting is for human consumption and is destined for places like west Africa. It is a really important and affordable source of protein for communities in West Africa. It was supposed to go through a fish producer and processor in Killybegs but the SFPA said that the water had to be separated from the fish. That essentially turns the blue whiting into fish meal so rather than turn food into fish meal, the Danish vessel turned away and today, the Norwegian vessel has had to go to Derry. The processor in Derry operates under the same European Union rules but commonsense is in play. This means that approximately 40 lorry loads of fish will be coming from Derry to Killybegs while we get lectured about climate change and our responsibilities. This is the madness and insanity of the way we interpret EU rules. An episode of ""Father Ted"" would not compare to what we are seeing right now in Killybegs.  It is madness to ask fishermen to turn food for human consumption, destined for places like West Africa, into fish meal. This matter was raised earlier by Deputy Doherty. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that the transcript of my contribution is urgently given to his colleague in Cabinet, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue in order that he can he intervene as a matter of urgency.

Similarly, Spain has now announced €68 million in support for its industry, including a range of interventions. Apart from a tie-up scheme, which is linked to the existing Brexit adjustment reserve fund, what is the Minister doing for people in the fishing industry? They cannot go to sea. This impacts on food supply. This impacts on an industry that has been hard hit by Brexit, as the Minister knows. Some 60 boats will decommission.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	49	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2022-03-31	dail	33	Fisheries Protection	dbsect_24	The inshore and offshore fishermen to whom I speak, including those in County Donegal, are telling me that with prices tripling, they just cannot afford to go to sea. If you look at what happened in France before Article 26 was triggered, you will see that France intervened by providing a direct subsidy to its fishing industry, which was some kind of assistance. Similarly, Spain has now announced €68 million in support for its industry, including a range of interventions. Apart from a tie-up scheme, which is linked to the existing Brexit adjustment reserve fund, what is the Minister doing for people in the fishing industry? They cannot go to sea. This impacts on food supply. This impacts on an industry that has been hard hit by Brexit, as the Minister knows. Some 60 boats will decommission. We are down to 30% of what the fleet needs to be above 18 m. This industry is already in crisis. This will be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. What is the Minister going to do?	spk_136

There is a whole range of interventions to assist the fishing industry in Spain. I just do not see the same detail here. I say to the Minister again, with all due respect, that I am concerned about the marine aspect of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The Minister has massive responsibilities and a huge food supply crisis across the whole sector. The marine area of the Department needs a dedicated Minister of State. It needs one person keeping hold of the Department and working directly with the industry. I do not see a response in this country that is anywhere near what is happening in Spain or France. We have an industry that is more in crisis than its counterparts in Spain and France. I just do not understand this.	spk_138

As we speak in this Chamber, we are surrounded by the busts of the heroes of 1916, who took their stand in the midst of the First World War. In that awful war, tens of thousands of Irish nationalists and unionists were slaughtered. That has been burned into the minds of the Irish people ever since, such that when we achieved independence for 26 of our 32 counties, we would be separated from imperialism and empire and we would have our own, independent foreign policy. That approach over the decades has served us well but, let us be honest, it has been undermined again and again by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael-led Governments. An independent foreign policy and military neutrality give Ireland the unique opportunity to be honest brokers in conflict resolution throughout the world. It is the reason our peacekeepers, in blue helmets or blue berets, are so respected internationally. In our experience of conflict, those involved in our peace process have travelled to the Basque Country, Sri Lanka, Colombia and the Middle East to try to build peace. Military neutrality, as Deputy Brady said, can be active neutrality and can play a positive role in the world if we truly believe in it. We need to learn from all the conflicts of recent times that if Ireland had a Government that truly believed in active neutrality, we could play a significant role in conflict resolution internationally, and more so than we have done. We have not taken the opportunity. We have not built on the considerable respect for the peacekeepers in our Defence Forces, of whom we are immensely proud. Rather than go down the road too many in Fine Gael have gone down, to move towards scrapping our military neutrality, we need to embrace it and take the opportunity that is there.	spk_48

Unfortunately, too many governments have missed the opportunity it provides. Despite the huge respect our UN peacekeepers, the blue helmets, have attained across the world, and despite the role in conflict resolution those of us in Ireland have played in Sri Lanka, Colombia, the Middle East and the Basque Country, the opportunity has been repeatedly wasted. We have had a half-hearted approach to military neutrality from the parties that sit across the Chamber for far too long. They have actively undermined it in the approach to Shannon Airport, for example, for so many years. They have not believed in it. It was there in words but not in practice. It is an honourable tradition. It comes from us being victims of empire for so long and rejecting any military alliances that give any support for that type of imperialism or empire-building approach. It means that we have the opportunity to play a role in conflict resolution around the world and actively seek out that position internationally. I do not believe we have ever done that, really. Perhaps we could be playing a far more considerable role right now, for example. We have a seat on the UN Security Council. That seat was won, in my opinion and that of many others, because of our position of military neutrality. Governments across the floor of this Chamber have wasted the opportunity for far too long, however. There needs to be a passionate embracing of that policy and a backing up of the role of our UN peacekeepers and many superb diplomats and peacebuilders we have had over the years. We have had experience of conflict resolution in the past 20 years. It is ongoing on this island but we have not utilised it enough. Indeed, the people who were involved in that peace process are the people who went to Sri Lanka, Colombia, the Basque Country and the Middle East. To a lesser extent, our own governments were formerly involved in it, even though we are militarily neutral. We are not politically neutral, though. We can condemn and stand up against wanton acts of brutality such as we have seen from the Russian Government in recent times. We can support sanctions and support confronting this across the world. We can do all that and maintain military neutrality. I welcome the debate on military neutrality. I welcome also challenging those who did not stand by it for far too long. They talked about it but they never stood by it. They never delivered the full potential of it internationally. They left it to others who were involved in peacebuilding on this island to fulfil the role of conflict resolution and that is the reality. They also did not build on the huge respect, and I will say it again, for our UN peacekeepers - our blue helmets, the thousands of Irish men and women who kept the peace around the world because we are militarily neutral. The Government failed them by not building on it. It failed those involved in the peace process in this country by not building on it, and now it appears it is going to fail again in this moment in which we could play a much more constructive role in peacebuilding and bringing this conflict to an end.	spk_126

It is about representing the real-life experience of their constituents. In Donegal, at least two thirds of the homes have home heating oil as their fuel source for domestic heating. The Government has no proposal to reduce those costs. A year ago, people could get 1,000 litres of oil to fill a tank for approximately €600.Today, it is at least double that. An oil tank has to be filled up a number of times every year in order to heat a home. This is disastrous for ordinary families in places like rural Donegal and in towns and villages across that county. We also have a public transport deficit in Donegal. Those who want to get an education or earn a living have to have a car. It is an absolute necessity; it is not a luxury. They are being absolutely hammered. I have been inundated with stories recently from families telling me about the impact for them to get to work or a place of education every day. They have to make hard choices in their home. Do they go to work? Do they heat the home? How do they pay for the kids? They have to make all those decisions. Before Russia invaded Ukraine we had a cost-of-living crisis that was growing and growing. Of course, it has become even more disastrous since the invasion happened. The response of the Government in the motion tonight is unacceptable. The Minister knows this benefit was wiped out overnight before people could even get it. We need to know what the Government is doing at European level to look at the whole issue of VAT. Why is it not addressing the home heating oil issue? It is an absolute insult to people in places like Donegal that it is not being addressed. Will the Minister, for God's sake, talk to the Minister for Transport and tell him to cop himself on and not to be lecturing people in rural Ireland about sharing cars and slowing down? Really, that is not what people in rural Ireland need to hear from any Government Minister tonight.	spk_427

We think of the heroic Dunnes Stores workers who refused to handle the South African goods. They took that stand and inspired the rest of the Irish people and the then Government. Ireland led the way internationally in confronting that regime. How can we stand here in 2022 when there is overwhelming evidence of apartheid, as internationally defined in law, taking place in Israel and Palestine? B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which are internationally respected human rights organisations, are rightly being quoted in recent days as trustworthy sources on what is happening with regard to the outrage that is unfolding in Ukraine. We trust those organisations in their accounts of what is happening in Ukraine, and rightly so. However, we allow their findings to be disputed without robust confrontation. For anybody to seriously suggest that what is happening in Israel and Palestine is not apartheid is shocking to me. I have seen it with my own eyes. I have seen the apartheid wall in Jerusalem, I was in Ramallah, and I travelled to Hebron and saw what happened there. That city and community were devastated to protect hundreds of illegal settlers. I saw, on the road to Bethlehem and up to Jerusalem, the reality of Israeli apartheid. I met the families who are being forced out of their own homes in Jerusalem. I saw the settler communities that are illegal under the law, defined as a ""war crime"" under international law and subject to UN resolution after UN resolution. I saw those things with my own eyes. I saw the reality of how the Palestinian people in those cities were treated compared with the illegal settlers. I saw the infrastructure being provided to the illegal settler communities compared to that provided for the ancient Palestinian community in those cities. It is a damning indictment on our country that in the 1980s we led the way by confronting the South African apartheid regime and yet today we cannot even pass legislation that bans illegal settler goods. These settlements are illegal under international law and yet we engage in commerce with those who are responsible for that repugnant situation. We cannot even pass that law in this country. We cannot recognise the Palestinian state. The two-state solution has been intentionally destroyed by the Israeli state. There is no Palestinian state left because it has been destroyed, dismantled and disconnected. The Minister knows that because he has been there. He must change direction. We must go back to our roots when we stood up to South Africa."	spk_379

There is an unprecedented crisis in that department in terms of staffing, with morale extremely low. This is the outcome of a build-up of failures, for far too many years, to invest in beds, nurses and doctors in the hospital. Letterkenny is the major acute hospital in Donegal and the sixth largest hospital in the State, with more than 23,000 inpatients every year. However, it is 13th or 14th in the country in terms of funding. It has been clear for many years that it has not received the budget it requires. There is a profound crisis of morale among staff. They go to work every day in what can only be described as heroic circumstances but they are tired of being called heroes. They need the backing of the State. That crisis of morale feeds into the waiting list crisis. In Letterkenny alone, there are 21,500 men, women and children on the waiting lists. Adding Sligo would probably take that total to 25,000 or 26,000 people on waiting lists out of a population of 160,000, many of them for more than one year or two years. This crisis has been created out of years of neglect. In community hospitals in Donegal, one in four beds were cut in the past 15 years. Community hospital resources are being cut and major hospitals are not being resourced. The impact of that is what we see today, with ten ambulances backed up at Letterkenny and staff at crisis point. I ask the Minister again to visit Letterkenny University Hospital as soon as possible, speak to the unions, staff and management and make the intervention that is required.	spk_335

Let me talk about north Donegal. It is not that long ago that people could have rented a family home in the towns of north Donegal for €600 per month but now they would be lucky if they got it for less than €1,100 or €1,200 a month, and that happened within a very short period of time. This is due to the policy of not building public housing for many years, forcing families into the private sector, as well as the unavailability of properties in the private sector. A key issue is the failure to go proactively after buildings that are derelict or vacant to turn them into housing or a resource for the community. What we see in town centres in the north of Donegal are great community activists. They are in every single town and every single community. They are salt of the earth people but they are being let down by the failure of local authorities to work to turn derelict properties into viable resources. This is repugnant at a time when we have a profound housing crisis but, of course, in north Donegal, when we add the mica crisis and the houses that are crumbling around families, we have a perfect storm. Now, we are going to have to re-house families for a year or a year and a half while they are waiting for their homes to be rebuilt. They are now looking for the scarce resource of a private rental property to live in while their homes are being rebuilt at a time where there just are not any. If the Minister of State talks to Threshold or the Simon Community, he will know they cannot secure a house to rent in north Donegal. If somebody is on the housing assistance payment and is waiting to receive a council house or a public house, and they are told that the landlord is going to sell the property in six months, and it is all perfectly legal and proper notice has been given, that person cannot secure a home. There are good hard-working people who present and say they are going to be homeless soon or are homeless. This is the scale of the crisis but I have not seen in recent years the urgency and the awareness to deal with that. People ask how we can have such a profound housing crisis, how we can have a scenario where rents are unattainable for working families, not just in the cities but even in places like Donegal, yet we allow so many properties and so many buildings to lie derelict. There is the issue of the failure to deploy these buildings to address the housing crisis but there is also the failure in letting down community activists. For example, we praise Tidy Towns volunteers up and down the country regarding how they paint all the buildings that are lying empty and the fences and the walls, and how they restore civic pride in our communities, yet we allow a situation where there are derelict buildings. I will not pick out individual towns as that would be unfair but there are beautiful towns in north Donegal where people come in from the outside and ask what is going on. They ask why there are so many buildings that are derelict, lying empty or unused. The powers that be - the legal infrastructure, the local authorities and the Government of the land – have failed to put in place the environment where this is addressed. They have let down the community activists, let down our volunteers in the community and, most serious of all, failed families. I take this opportunity to say very clearly to the Minister of State that this is unacceptable in a profound housing crisis where young people are leaving this country not because they do not have work, as was the case in the past in places like Donegal, but because they cannot afford to put a roof over their heads. Now, they cannot afford the rent. While all of that is happening, there are a huge number of empty, derelict or vacant properties that are not utilised by the State. It has to change and I hope this debate leads to that.	spk_296

Person K was clearly a mass murderer. He was a key suspect in 17 murders and seven attempted murders. The report of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland states that in 2016 the senior investigating officer for Operation Greenwich passed on a file about Person K to the PSNI. Six years on, we are not aware of where that investigation sits. This is a person who literally had a licence to kill, including the murder of Sinn Féin councillor, Eddie Fullerton, in Donegal. Today, I want to talk about ""Person J"". Person J, who is also covered in this report, was a serving member of the UDR when he was a key suspect in the murder of Gerard Casey in 1989. In early 1991, the RUC found documentation on large numbers of republicans in the home of Person J. He was released on bail shortly after that. During the time he was on bail, he was a key suspect in two murders, that of Councillor Eddie Fullerton and Tommy Donaghy, who was a member of Sinn Féin. Person J was also closely associated with the persons suspected of murdering Sinn Féin councillor, Bernard O'Hagan. This includes two Sinn Féin councillors in the period of mid-1991, Eddie Fullerton in May 1991 and Bernard O'Hagan in September 1991, and Tommy Donaghy, a Sinn Féin member, in August 1991. He was on bail and a former UDR member at that stage. He resigned from the UDR in late 1990. This is all contained in the report. We understand he was eventually sentenced to a year in prison. The judge, apparently, was not presented with any evidence that Person J was connected to loyalist paramilitaries, even though he was a key suspect in the 1989 murder of Gerard Casey and was well known to be closely associated with leading loyalists at that time. Months after he was released from prison, he was a key suspect in two further murders. That is just one shocking episode in addition to Person K. I urge the Minister to look at both cases and to pursue this matter vigorously."	spk_399

The Whiddy Island disaster in 1979 should have focused minds. The  It is a serious matter that the Róisín Lacey report of 2010 was revealed through a whistleblower when it should have been published by the Minister's Department long ago. That recommended a multinodal accident investigation office to cover air, marine and rail, like the Swedish model. It was not acted upon. That has led to a complaint being sent to An Garda Síochána by Michael Kingston. This could not be more serious. The complaint alleges that these failures have led unnecessarily to lives being lost at sea. In 2020, there was a humiliating judgment in Europe. There is huge expense again and again and failure by the Department to ensure a truly independent board. The Captain Clinch report still has not been published. Reports have repeatedly not been published or acted upon. It is failure after failure. The Minister is asking us to take a leap of faith and trust the Department responsible for that widespread catalogue of failure. As my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, said, our party cannot support this.

We should have a proper process that protects families and provides training, support and protection to those at sea, whether involved in leisure or fisheries. Michael Kingston has been assisting the families of Gerry Doherty and Thomas Weir, who died tragically in Donegal. I have profound concerns about the findings in that regard. Michael Kingston and others say that, had there been the necessary training and support for people who go to sea, those lives did not have to be lost. I could give many other examples. This was an opportunity for the Minister to do something comprehensive. In the pre-legislative scrutiny provided, there was an offer to draft legislation using templates from international best practice. As it happens, the Minister had draft legislation from the Róisín Lacey report all those years ago. That was just buried and not acted upon. A complaint has gone to An Garda Síochána, I think rightly. The Minister needs to oversee a review of how the hell that was not implemented at the time and why it did not appear among the other manifestations that come towards this legislation. The Minister is asking people to take a leap of faith but people have lost faith in how the Department of Transport has handled this over the years. It could not be more serious. We will oppose this Bill. We see it as a missed opportunity by the Minister to get this right with many people offering in good faith to assist.The Minister will have seen that from the transcript of the committee meeting and he will have seen the offers available there. Whatever way he deals with this tonight, it is necessary for him to move towards a model based on what is in place in Sweden. I refer to what was recommended all those years ago, in 2010, in the Róisín Lacey report. All these endeavours must come under the one roof and there must be total independence, which people can have faith in. When tragedies happen, and sadly they do happen, we must learn lessons from them and try not to repeat those mistakes again. Unfortunately, there is a catalogue and a chronology of failure here that the Minister must get his head around. Whatever way he deals with this tonight, he needs to go away and then come back with proper legislation containing a completely independent system that will give people faith that mistakes will not be repeated when tragedies happen.	spk_478

This week, the Government has about 12 hours of time available and none of it has been allocated to statements from the Opposition. This is not sustainable, and it cannot continue. This has been the Taoiseach's position week after week. I seek a commitment from him on the matter now. For example, last week he committed to statements on two ombudsman's reports that came from the North, but that was not agreed. In spite of there being 12 hours of Government time, none of it is allocated to the Opposition for statements. That is totally unsustainable and unacceptable.

He knows the history of it. When he was the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on agriculture, food and the marine, his colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, the then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on the marine and fisheries, moved an annulment of the statutory instrument from 2018 and for the first time in the history of the State, a statutory instrument was annulled. That is how strongly Pat the Cope Gallagher, former Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this House, felt about the issue. Not only did he oppose the statutory instrument, he made it clear that fishermen supported the principle of penalty points but it had to be fair and balanced. He put forward a number of proposals at that time as a solution. If one looks at the amendments from the Sinn Féin and Rural Independent Group Deputies, they reflect what the Fianna Fáil fisheries spokesperson at that time believed in. I will not read back to the Minister what he said in the Dáil but he was seriously concerned about the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and he felt there was a culture in that Department at that time which led to a mishandling of this whole affair. It should be remembered that fishermen had already won a number of court cases against previous Government decisions which found their rights were being infringed upon and this was not balanced and yet, the Minister has brought this legislation back pretty much verbatim. The Minister has travelled around the coast. He has met fishermen online and in person all around the coast. He knows their views towards the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, which, unfortunately, has been a dysfunctional organisation and is now undertaking reform at last. However, the Minister knows there are protests within the organisation. It is dysfunctional and has not served its purpose properly around the State. This dysfunctionality led to the withdrawal of our control plan, which was a disaster. That has recently been reversed, thanks to the huge effort of the fishermen in resisting this and standing up for their rights. The SFPA allowed a message to go out there that we were overfishing and involved in widespread illegality to the tune of tens of thousands of tonnes and hundreds of millions of euro. This was widely reported in the media because it was leaked. We do not know who did so, but somebody in either the SFPA or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine leaked information to media in Ireland that was hugely damaging to and deeply untrue about the industry. What happened next? On the back of all of that, the European Commission withdrew the control plan. That is the level of crisis that has created the lack of distrust between our fishermen and those who are supposed to work with them. People understand regulation is needed in this country. There needs to be oversight. We all accept that. Fishing has to be sustainable and one has to stick to whatever the science says. It would be reckless not to do so. To be clear, everybody agrees on that. However, the reason we in Sinn Féin tabled these amendments, along with our colleagues in the Rural Independent Group, is that it is outrageous to set a threshold of conviction where somebody's livelihood can be taken away, which is the balance of probabilities in this legislation. It is on the balance of probabilities, rather than beyond reasonable doubt, which is the universally accepted threshold for conviction. We have repeatedly appealed to the Minister to remove the balance of probabilities and make it beyond reasonable doubt. It is an entirely reasonable appeal. It would have been a gesture of goodwill from the Minister to those fisheries communities, whose trust in the likes of the SFPA and indeed the Department is on the floor and it gives me no pleasure to say that.We have to rebuild those relationships. I appeal to the Department and the marine officials who will either tune into this debate tonight or read the transcript to start to rebuild those relationships. When the Minister was on this side of the House he said exactly the same. I will read back his script later if necessary. He said he was really concerned about the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and its relationship with fishing communities. My concern in the few years since he said those words remains exactly the same. We need to rebuild trust and the relationship between the Department, the SFPA and fishing communities. Getting this legislation wrong is not the way to do that. At that time, I spoke to the then Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher, who was the Leas-Cheann Comhairle at the time, the Fianna Fáil fishery spokesperson previous to that and a very fine Member of the Oireachtas for many years. I read his proposal to strengthen the legislation. He would feel just as strongly as we do now. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Minister has not changed the language in this law to ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". Every single person has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. That is the threshold, yet the legislation refers to the balance of probability. The Minister knows that is wrong and the then Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher knew it was wrong when he had this statutory instrument annulled. I appeal to the Minister tonight to get rid of this offensive language and lower threshold because every citizen has a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. That is natural justice but that is not what is in this legislation. What that tells me is that the people in the Department who drafted this legislation and write the Minister's briefing notes still do not get the anger and blind fury. Anybody in a coastal community knows there is blind anger and fury in fishing communities about they way they are being treated and the facts that they are not listened to and had to sign up to the seafood task force report on the basis that that is just how it is and there are not enough fish out there. I will speak about all of that later. The Minister hails from a coastal community and knows this legislation is wrong."	spk_374

In the annulment motion tabled by his colleague, former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, he stated:We need to take on board the needs of the fishing sector. We need to avoid the possibility of it being struck down in the courts again. The Department's track record in introducing a penalty-points regime has been poor. Given that on two occasions attempted statutory instruments were struck down following appeals to the Supreme Court reflects very poorly on the management of the issue heretofore.The Minister dares to lecture me when those were his words at that time. I will continue. The Minister stated:The key points that remain to be addressed relate to the burden of proof. The current approach in the statutory instrument deals with the balance of probability rather than having to prove beyond doubt, which is normally the case where a criminal sanction is being pursued. The role of the SFPA permeates the statutory instrument at all stages, which was the basis on which the Supreme Court struck down the previous statutory instruments.The Minister was against everything that he is now defending. He was on the same side as us when he spoke the last time and he was heavily critical of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the SFPA in his commentary, but the Minister tells me that I am personalising it.	spk_383

It was screened in the audiovisual room in Leinster House and everybody was invited. It was a tremendously powerful documentary. Something that stayed in my mind from that documentary was the fisherman Jerry Early in Arranmore. He had been dragged into the courts. That was the reality for him. He was back on the boat and trying to eke out a livelihood fishing off Arranmore. There is a scene in the documentary where he is sitting on the boat and the interviewer is talking to him. He talks about a city of lights behind him - the super trawlers. We were going after the inshore fishermen and the island fishermen, treating them like criminals, while a city of lights, a super trawler, was hoovering up the sea behind them. We were telling those fishermen not to catch the odd salmon or herring, or whatever it might be here or there, while a super trawler was coming out and legally hoovering up fish with no oversight, CCTV or observers on board. They were landing massive catches. That is the context and the profound injustice involved. We are going after our fishermen while we hand over more than 85% of the fish in our waters without a fight. Bluefin tuna is the most lucrative fish in the sea. It is now in abundance in our waters thanks to good practices. The quota for the European fishing fleet increased by 78% in recent years. An additional quota was given to the fishing fleets of Europe. What did the Irish fishermen get of that? Not 1 kg. The Irish fishermen can catch bluefin tuna but they must release them again. They can catch them and look at them but they have to be thrown back into the water again. Fishermen from all other fleets in Europe can come into our waters and beyond. International fishermen can catch the most lucrative fish in the world. Imagine the difference bluefin tuna would make for our inshore fishermen, even if they were told to line catch them. There was no fight in that regard. This is an environment in which there is growing anger. In 2005, we had 280 fishing vessels that were longer than 50 m. That is indisputable. When the latest decommissioning round is completed, we will be down to fewer than 100. Our fleet is one third of the size it was in 2005. Is it any wonder fishermen have lost faith in their own Department and the Government, and why they are infuriated by people harassing them, following them and chasing them? The Minister knows this. He has been around the piers and harbours. We forced our fishermen to take their fish out of iceboxes, weigh them and put them back into the boxes. The Minister knows that under the seafood regulations there is a crucial issue around the temperature of fish and the process of taking them from the sea, maintaining them at the right temperature and freshness, and selling them to market. That is an EU directive around seafood safety and yet all of that was undermined by another directive on the back of a poor job by the SFPA on auditing. All that was leaked. The Minister accused me of personalising the issue and being nasty. I challenge him to disprove a single word I have said in my contribution.Is it nasty to speak the truth? Is it unreasonable to tell the truth about what is happening to our fishing and coastal communities? I appeal to the Minister to listen to them. He is from a coastal community. He is not far from the sea in the middle of Inishowen. Nearby are Urris, Malin Head and Greencastle, with its good-sized harbour. There are decent piers in the area. The Minister knows these people. He knows who they are and that they are the salt of the earth. He knows how they feel. I am appealing to him for a change of direction. I am not questioning the Minister's character. We have known each other long enough. However, I cannot understand the direction he is taking here. I cannot understand how the senior officials in the Department, who have failed for so many years, have the Minister moving in a direction that is wrong. This legislation is wrong. This is not a personal attack on the Minister. I personally have good regard for him and we have known each other long enough. I genuinely and from my heart tell him that from speaking to fishermen around the coast, that is how they feel. Nothing I have said can be refuted. I ask the Minister to take it any way he wants but this is a genuine appeal to him, as an Inishowen man surrounded by water, to do what is right by the people we have known all our lives. That is all I am asking and nothing more."	spk_407

If the Minister has not read through the report, I ask that he do so. I will focus on one individual identified as ""Person K"". When one reads through the report, it is absolutely astonishing that Person K was never brought to justice for that person's central involvement in at least 17 murders and seven attempted murders. Deputy Brendan Smith referred to a number of bombings in this State. That puts a focus on what is missing from our peace process. When the Good Friday Agreement took place, as the Minister well remembers, the IRA and loyalists - the protagonists on this island - accepted responsibility and conveyed their regrets for the hurt and pain they had inflicted during the conflict. What was missing, however, was the central role of the British state in that conflict, right through from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and into the 1990s. One case that is deeply personal to me is that of Councillor Eddie Fullerton. Eddie was a personal hero of mine. I was a teenager when he was taken away from us. His family have campaigned tirelessly for justice for the last 30 years. In 2006, they made a complaint to the police ombudsman in the North. Seven years later, the then ombudsman, Dr. Michael Maguire, said that the issues he and his team had uncovered in the re-examination of Councillor Eddie Fullerton's assassination and murder had thrown up wider issues that he wanted to investigate. He asked the family if they would hold back on the interim report and wait until the publication of a final report. It was incredibly gracious of the family, particularly Eddie's widow Dinah who would have been in her 70s at that stage, that they did so. If we fast forward to recent weeks, more than 15 years after the family's original complaint to the ombudsman, we end up with this damning report. It is a tribute to the Fullerton family in particular, but also all the other families. It deals with 19 murders between 1989 and 1993. I want to talk about Person K. This person, whose identity is known to me and, more importantly, the families and their legal representatives is a mass murderer who was given a licence to kill by the British state. This person is closely identified with the murders of Gerard Casey, Councillor Eddie Fullerton, Thomas Donaghy, Danny Cassidy, Malachy Carey and the massacres at Castlerock and Greysteel. In the case of the murder of Malachy Carey, the person convicted as a getaway driver in that murder said he got the car from Person K. The getaway car was registered in Person K's name yet Person K was never arrested. That is what the ombudsman uncovered. Person K was at the scene of murder after murder and, again and again, was not brought to justice. Person K gave an alibi for Torrens Knight, who admitted his responsibility for the Castlerock massacre and was also convicted of the Greysteel massacre. The alibi for Torrens Knight came from Person K. Another person, the brigadier of the UDA, also gave an alibi. Yet, after Torrens Knight admitted his role, they were never questioned or brought to justice. The big one is the Greysteel massacre, however. One of those convicted for Greysteel identified Person K as overseeing the purchase of the car, supplying the weapons, making sure they got to carry out their dastardly deed. Person K's fingerprints were found on the holdall with the weapons used at Greysteel and the plastic bag. Again, Person K was not brought to justice. I appeal to the Minister and his Department officials to examine this report deeply, particularly Person K, a mass murderer with a licence to kill. He must be brought to justice."	spk_239

Again and again it failed because of the closeness of whoever was in government at the time to the building industry. Again and again the building industry had influence over legislation. Where did it take us? It took us to the disaster of pyrite on the east coast and mica and pyrite on the west coast. There has been no regulation, light-touch regulation and self-regulation. This is why the points that have been made are so important. We cannot have the industry overseeing the register. We cannot have representatives of the industry on the board overseeing the register. It must be an independent register and there must be independent oversight of the industry. I find it objectionable to see the presentation of people in Donegal, Mayo and elsewhere in the west of Ireland as looking for money for their houses. Where is the analysis of the utter failure of successive Governments to regulate the building, construction and manufacturing industries? How did we allow a scenario whereby local authorities were completely starved of resources to do that job and make sure blocks were manufactured to the proper standard? How can it be that in another jurisdiction on our island people in the building industry are observed at every stage of construction? Homes are built to a much higher standard. How is it that we could not have achieved that? I want to make an appeal. Our people in Donegal, Mayo and elsewhere in the west of Ireland waited for many years to have a scheme on defective blocks that is 100% redress. They were failed by those who spoke in the House over the years. Those tasked with legislation in the House over the years failed those families. They are victims of legislative and regulatory failure. They cannot be abandoned anymore. We need genuine 100% redress. We need it urgently. We need the legislation to be put through these Houses as soon as possible and a scheme that gives them the opportunity to rebuild their lives. They had to go through another Christmas with this nightmare all around them, with no clarity about what the future will be.

My colleague, Deputy Doherty, among others, has been calling for the full report to be published. It has taken too long to get to this point. It has been a long and harrowing road for the families of those who suffered the most horrendous abuse. They hoped that this report would finally give them the answers they have been waiting on for years. We now know that more than 100 occurrences of sexually inappropriate behaviour were carried out by one resident who has been given the pseudonym ""Brandon"" in the report and that there were 18 victims. We know that Brandon was moved from time to time but while such moves gave respite to victims and staff in one area, they allowed Brandon to carry on abusing new victims in the area to which he was moved. This was the most awful of situations. These victims were the most vulnerable in our society. They were non-verbal and placed all of their trust in the centre and the HSE to protect them. That obviously did not happen. Those victims were failed. After the bravery of a whistleblower and after the reports to HIQA and An Garda Síochána, the individual identified as Brandon was eventually isolated and the abuse stopped.  This can never, ever be allowed to happen again. Even after all of this and despite public calls for the publication of the report, the full report is still not being published. The executive summary, while detailed, is still not the full report. The families and the public need to know all of the facts. Why continue to drag this out? The families and the public deserve the full truth. To properly protect our most vulnerable patients going forward, we need to learn from the mistakes here. The executive summary is not enough to do that. There are continuing questions for the HSE. The executive summary raises questions regarding the management and leadership of the HSE during this period.  I am also annoyed that the publication of the executive summary has come on the last day of this Dáil term. Given the gravity of what is contained therein, sufficient time must be allocated in the Dáil to debate the report and its findings in full. Will the Government press the HSE to publish the full report? I am sure that the Tánaiste will agree that there needs to be accountability for the failures in how all of this was managed. Given the seriousness of the issues, will he commit to providing time to debate this report in full at the first opportunity when the Dáil resumes in the new year?"	spk_162

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-12-09	dail	33	Seafood Taskforce Final Report: Statements	dbsect_33	"I am sharing time with Deputies Carthy and Conway-Walsh. The report of the seafood task force is presented as the future of the Irish fishing industry and a blueprint for creating vibrant coastal communities. While there are some good measures in it and, of course, welcome funding, we must face the hard reality. The report, if implemented, will further reduce the Irish fishing fleet and, by consequence, the Irish fishing industry. Ireland has approximately 20% of Europe's northern and western fishing waters. A total of 30% of all fish landed in Europe is produced in Irish waters, yet we have some of the smallest fishing quotas for species in all of Europe. Since we joined the European Economic Community, EEC, in 1973, Governments have made mistake after mistake in building a vibrant and sustainable Irish fishing industry. It is arguable whether we want to build or have an industry at all at this point. It seems that, when this or previous Governments have had to negotiate to fight for our fishermen, the default position has been to raise the white flag. The Irish fishing industry has always been the sacrificial lamb. Ireland has taken part in two EU-funded decommissioning schemes that dramatically reduced the Irish fleet, and now there is another decommissioning proposal to get rid of a further 60 boats. In 2006, there were 280 boats of more than 18 m in the Irish fleet fishing offshore. After this latest scheme, that fleet will be reduced to one third of what it was 15 years ago. What a damning indictment of Government policy and failure over the past 15 years. While we tear apart our fishing communities, countries such as France and Belgium are investing in the upgrading of their fleets. This is no surprise when we consider the percentage of the fish they take from our Irish waters compared with what is allocated to our own fishing fleet under the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP. I reiterate only 15%, or even less, of the total value of the catch from Irish waters, the exclusive economic zone under the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, is allocated to the Irish fishing fleet. This is utterly shameful. In contrast, 75% of the fish in British waters is allocated to their fishing fleet. We have long called for a full review of the Common Fisheries Policy. Is there an appetite among the Government or the Civil Service to go to Europe and fight for such a review? A partial review is to commence in January but we need a full review, with everything on the table. We need to find and build solidarity and alliances with other European partners and truly reopen the Common Fisheries Policy, once and for all. The unfairness must end and what better opportunity than now when Brexit has changed so much? It is the profound unfairness and injustice, above everything else, that sticks in the craw of the Irish fishing community. For decades, Irish fishermen have watched European fishing vessels come into Irish waters and fish away at huge quotas compared with those for Irish boats, then watched them unload their uninspected catch into frozen container trucks and go home to their own countries. Meanwhile, Irish vessels are chased from pillar to post by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Naval Service, with much lower quotas, and have recently been forced to unload their iced catch on the harbours, de-ice it for inspection and only then send it to the factory for processing. It would be laughable were it not so serious. Let us take just one example to prove this. This goes to the heart of so-called relative stability, which has been, and continues to be, a complete and utter disaster for Irish fishing. During the formative years of 1977 to 1982, the Irish system did not record its catches in any accurate manner. Let us take the example of monkfish. The French currently have an allocation of 50% of the monkfish in Irish waters, while Ireland has 5%. Is that fair? Something has to give, things have to change and the Minister and his Department must lead that. This year, when the flotilla of fishing boats sailed up to the River Lee and into Cork city, and then up the River Liffey and into Dublin city, it marked a sea change. The fishing industry had united in protest and opposition to the disastrous policies of the Minister's Government and those who preceded it. No more would they accept weak negotiation on their behalf, no more white flags or jelly bellies. The year 2021 has seen pelagic and polyvalent quotas reduced by 30%, demersal quotas by 20% and the inshore fleet reduced to targeting non-quota shellfish. Our industry is dying and, as far as it is concerned, the State is assisting in its dying. As I said earlier, the French and Belgian states are sponsoring the building of new vessels, while we in Ireland are proposing the decommissioning of a further 30% of our offshore fleet of over 18 m, or 60 of our boats. When you step back and think about it, this is worse than bonkers; it is self-destruction. Where do we start? Burden-sharing must be reopened in these upcoming December talks. The reality is there has been none. The burden of Brexit on the European fishing fleet may as well have been undertaken unilaterally by the Irish industry. That must be the starting position. Negotiations are always tough, but now is the time to show steel. Once and for all, Ireland needs the Minister with responsibility for the marine and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to stand up for Irish interests. At the very least, he needs to go to Brussels with a minimum levelling-up approach imprinted in his thinking. This would take account of at least some small element of the historical loss and unfairness we have suffered. It would also set a marker for the upcoming review of the CFP at European level. Gone are the days when we were the best boys and girls in class, when we would say, ""Yes sir, no sir"" and take what we were given in terms of quotas. It is time to defend our industry, be proud of our immense natural resource and outline to Europe what we want and need in order to build our proud industry. We want our fair share of what is ours and will not stand any more for being stamped on and told to put up with everything. Representatives of various fish producer organisations attended yesterday's Oireachtas committee meeting. They did not enthusiastically endorse the report and they certainly did not enthusiastically endorse decommissioning. They did so with a heavy heart. They have fishermen on their books who have no future, through no fault of their own but through that of Government after Government. They do not believe things will change and they will avail of this scheme with a very heavy heart. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is being negotiated between Britain and Europe.The Minister and the Taoiseach need to insist that we have access to those negotiations because they will have an enormous impact on our fortunes at the Council. The Minister will have a limited engagement in the days ahead while these negotiations continue. The island communities have real concerns about this report. They have made submissions and I will forward to the Minister their submission outlining their ongoing concerns. They are not enthusiastically endorsing this report. I conclude my contribution by quoting the famous Luke Kelly poem:For what died the sons of Róisín, was it greed?...Will German, French or Dutch inscribe the epitaph of Emmet?When we have sold enough of Ireland to be but strangers in itFor what died the sons of Róisín, was it greed?Were words ever more appropriate to what is happening in our beloved coastal and fishing communities?"	spk_286

I wish to speak to the amendment submitted by Sinn Féin to the motion. It is about the need to have the affected fishing communities directly involved in the pre-planning process and to ensure that their livelihoods are protected. There are enough issues facing our inshore and offshore fishing communities in Ireland. They have been failed by the Common Fisheries Policy. I reiterate - this might shock the Minister as he may not know it - that only 15% of the fish caught in the Irish exclusive economic zone under the Common Fisheries Policy goes to the Irish fishing fleet. Some 85% is given away to the fishing fleets of other member states. It would be reasonable to share the waters, but 85%? That is the context in which we say our fishing communities have been squeezed really badly. This is an opportunity to coexist. There are opportunities, if this is managed properly, to develop offshore wind energy. One of the issues now is that people cannot consider going beyond 12 nautical miles for floating wind energy infrastructure that does not need to be fixed. It can be moved. It is connected through seabeds by cables. Rather than infrastructure that is close to the shore, which would have an impact on fishing grounds, this type of offshore energy could work better. There is also the need for transferable licences. There are skippers of fishing boats in Ireland who cannot transfer their licences through other marine work. That needs to be looked at. There needs to be an approach to our marine infrastructure and our marine resource that can serve the interests of the Irish people, which would involve this type of wind energy while also protecting our fishing communities. It is critical that whatever we do, our fishing communities are partners in the process and coexist with offshore energy such that one is not opposed to the other.	spk_28

In any democracy the role of NGOs in holding the government to account is absolutely critical. All of the six civil society organisations and non-governmental organisations that have been designated as terrorist are internationally respected and endorsed. I have been at numerous international meetings of parliamentarians over recent weeks at which I have listened to testimonies on the importance of their work. You get to the point where you wonder what it will take for the European Union and the international community to stand up and defend these rights. We have the reports from B'Tselem and Human Rights Watch, and I understand there are other reports designating the regime from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan river as an apartheid regime. However, because the Government here does not confront it or deal with it as we did with the South African apartheid regime, it continues to act with impunity. I am therefore not the least bit surprised that it has taken this action because it is never held to account in the international community. It will pay no price for these actions. What is the impact of this? These organisations' offices can be closed down, staff arrested and potentially jailed and equipment confiscated. These are internationally respected human rights defenders supported by this State and civil society organisations in this State, so this is an important opportunity to unite together in saying this House condemns the Israeli state and demands that it reverse this decision.	spk_282

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-11-30	dail	33	Employment Support Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_19	I am sharing time with Deputies Mythen, Patricia Ryan, Gould and Clarke. I know a little more than most about this subject. I was on the national executive of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed many years ago when these job clubs and local employment services were being put together. We were part of the team that worked around a community based response, working with people who were unemployed to put together tailor-made training programmes to help them get back into the world of work. This is good for unemployed people and good for businesses, which get workers who are fitted and want to stay in that career path down the line. This makes sense from every perspective. The importance of the motion of my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, is that it is about community working together. I will tell the story of our local job club in Buncrana. It is 20 years in place. In all of those years I have been a public representative and not once have I had a complaint about that service from people who are unemployed or from businesses. It was a tremendous service that is serving our community for 20 years, a whole generation. When it comes to JobPath and the Tory, right wing privatisation model, I could not tell the number of people in the community sector who are unemployed and have had a terrible, demeaning, dehumanising experience within that Tory model. Does the Minister know what she sounded like when she was speaking earlier? She sounded like Margaret Thatcher. The lady is not for turning. This is right wing, anti-community politics dressed somehow as prudence. It is not. It is anti-community. The Government is dismantling services that work for unemployed people, businesses and communities. For that reason, I say shame on the Minister if she is not going to reverse that position.	spk_318
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-11-24	dail	33	Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_17	My colleague, an Teachta O'Rourke, has already outlined Sinn Féin's approach to this Bill. We see it as a missed opportunity and hope the Minister of State will work with us on the substantive amendments that we will submit on Committee Stage, aimed at strengthening this legislation considerably.  I want to offer my solidarity to all of the families who have found themselves in the terrible position of having to engage with marine casualty investigations. As fisheries and marine spokesperson for Sinn Féin, I have a particular interest in ensuring that we minimise fishing tragedies as much as possible but that when they do happen, the most professional and swift investigations are carried out and comfort is given to bereaved families.  There are many misgivings about the current system and its shortcomings. These misgivings have been well articulated by those who have had the misfortune to have had to engage with the MCIB over many years, none more so than the respected campaigner Michael Kingston. During the Oireachtas committee's pre-legislative scrutiny hearings, Mr. Kingston put it on record that he has engaged with a multitude of departmental officials, current and former MCIB investigators and former departmental surveyors, all of whom have deep reservations about the current system. These reservations cannot be brushed under the carpet because to do so would be a disservice to all those who have passed due to marine tragedies and their families. I want to take this opportunity to read into the Dáil record the ongoing experience of the families of Gerry Doherty and Thomas Weir who both drowned in a boating tragedy near Portronan, Malin Head in Donegal on 17 July 2018. As Gerry's father, Paddy, had drowned in a crabbing accident when Gerry was a teenager, this was a double tragedy for his family who are very traumatised by all of this. There are serious questions about how the emergency response system of this State handled this tragedy on that fateful day and since. The families have serious issues with the MCIB investigation into the circumstances surrounding their loved ones' deaths and the level of co-operation from the MCIB with the ongoing inquest into their deaths. I ask the Minister of State to take a particular interest in this case because I have no doubt that more will be revealed in due course. This is another reason for serious reform of the board and its practices.  The EU judgment that demands this legislation has affirmed these concerns but this Bill is only one piece in the jigsaw that will fix it. The MCIB must be entirely independent of any other State agency or body and must have complete autonomy. Until this happens, doubts and questions will persist and this cannot continue. Mistakes have been made in the past. They must now be rectified and we must get this right. Failures that have occurred in the past have compounded hurt and made difficult situations even harder for survivors, loved ones and colleagues. These failures cannot happen again. As legislators, we must ensure that this legislation is only the start and not the end of a reform process.  To continue with part-time investigators in the marine area is entirely unacceptable. Michael Kingston has previously provided data on spending in the aviation and rail sectors compared to the marine sector and has pointed to the fact that those two sectors have full-time investigators despite, thankfully, having no deaths to investigate. It is imperative that we have full-time investigators for marine investigations. This is a must. The approach to the MCIB reflects the approach to the fisheries and marine sector in general in this country. We are the only island nation in the entirety of the EU now but fishermen in this State feel failed, neglected and abandoned by the Department and other State agencies. The approach to this board and how it has been allowed to continue for so long reflects the utter neglect of our marine resource and our marine communities by Government after Government.That is to be straight about it. It must stop. The process in terms of the legislation must be of the highest standard to recruit the best qualified individuals. I want to conclude by thanking Michael Kingston and others, notably, Ciaran McCarthy, who have given years of dedicated and selfless work to this issue for the greater good. I stress again that the priority must be getting this right. We must have a new system that can be trusted. Victims, survivors and their family members and loved ones deserve nothing less.	spk_231
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-11-17	dail	33	Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_19	I will take this opportunity to bring to the Minister's attention a matter I regard as serious and which has been ongoing for a number of years. It is an issue that arose following the digitisation of land boundaries in Ireland by the PRA, formerly known as the Land Registry. It moved to the digitisation of land maps during my first term as a Deputy. Issues with one landowner were brought to my attention in 2015. There were clear anomalies between the Ordnance Survey maps that person had and the folio they owned, on the one hand, and the digitised map, on the other. Unfortunately, in that case, because the adjoining landowner did not agree that those anomalies had taken place, it ended up in court and cost that person €80,000. That is a devastating amount. Since that person's traumatic experience, for which the PRA refused to accept any responsibility, I have come across numerous other cases in County Donegal where it is clear that the digitisation of the maps has adjusted boundaries. As the Minister will be aware, land disputes in Ireland can be very serious. In many instances, I am advised that, thankfully, neighbours have resolved the disputes themselves and agreed that the boundaries are not right. They have gone to the Land Registry and, apparently in some instance, resolved those anomalies because there was agreement. However, where the adjoining landowners are not in agreement, it can end in serious and costly disputes. In those instances, I am not aware of any occasion where the Land Registry has accepted its digital maps contained an error. There was a report in 2014, known as the Prendergast report, entitled, Towards the Registration of Defined Property Boundaries in Ireland. Involved in that report and supporting it were the Law Society, the Bar Council, Engineers Ireland, the Irish Planning Institute and other institutions that work with surveyors, architects and so on. It was a report of the inter-professional task force on property boundaries. It identified these issues as far back as 2014 but the PRA has never accepted any mistakes or errors have been made. That means people end up in protracted legal disputes. Six incidents have crossed my desk where I have no doubt there was an error. In the number of instances where I have engaged with the PRA, it has not accepted any errors whatsoever. It has refused to accept them. I understand parliamentary questions were tabled to Ministers, which will be on the record of the Oireachtas. Those Ministers talked about advice, exposure to legal costs and not wanting to get involved. That is totally and utterly wrong. I thought this was just a Donegal issue but I have received correspondence in the past week from a family in County Galway who have also gone through this experience. I have spoken to that family and they told me they are aware of families in counties Clare and Wicklow who have experienced similar trauma. That is what it is. In some cases, lines are going down the middle of a field. Obviously, that is an error. Those lines should obviously be drawn along a bank or a ditch. In some cases, there are lines going through very old houses. Clearly a mistake has been made. I will correspond with the Minister on this matter but I want to put on the record my belief that the digitisation process in the PRA has led to serious errors that have pushed people into protracted disputes with their neighbours and in some cases, I am sorry to report, with their families. Nobody is putting their hand up and saying mistakes were made when a blind man could see mistakes were made. I will correspond with the Minister and will bring to her attention the 2014 report I mentioned and its findings. This is an ongoing issue. I spoke earlier to an architect from County Donegal. That architect advised me of approximately 20 such cases in north Donegal. Some of them have been resolved because the people involved, thankfully, had common sense and agreed that the boundaries were mistaken and the error was corrected. However, many have not been resolved and it has caused untold trauma.The person who came to me originally faced a cost of €80,000 but nobody will accept any wrongdoing. When I correspond with the Minister and go into detail on some of these incidents, she should not say that she cannot comment on this case or that case. I guarantee her that if she surveys her Deputy, Senator and councillor colleagues throughout the State, she will learn of numerous cases where the digitisation process has led to errors that have caused untold trauma. When she has investigated this, there will have to be mediation for the families. Ideally, the PRA would consider all the cases and accept that mistakes were made, but the reason it is not doing so and departmental officials have not asked it to do so is the risk of exposing the State to financial costs and damages. We should say we are going to put in place a dedicated mediation system though which people must resolve these issues before they end up in court. There are many families right now who do not realise that what I have described has happened to them but who will realise it in due course when somebody opportunistically takes advantage. I have seen too many examples in my county and further examples have been brought to my attention in the past week, so much so that I decided that I would speak out about this matter today and appeal to the Minister, with whom I will correspond further, to intervene and carry out a review of the PRA's handling of this whole affair, which is totally and utterly unacceptable.	spk_275

My home county of Donegal has had major problems with ambulance services in recent years. There are a number of families who have lost loved ones due to the length of time it took the ambulance to arrive. There is no doubt about that. They have very courageously told their stories and campaigned for a better ambulance service. I am sorry to report, having spoken to people who work in the service over the past few days, that there are not enough personnel in place around the county. There are not enough ambulance bases, ambulances and personnel to cover the county. On top of that, the number of people waiting on trolleys over the past number of weeks in the major acute hospital, Letterkenny University Hospital, has been at the top. In that regard, currently, Letterkenny University Hospital is second only to University Hospital Limerick, which has a terrible problem with overcrowding and people waiting on trolleys in the emergency department. There is a backlog at the emergency department in Letterkenny and ambulances are backed up. From speaking to families, I know that there have been many instances of great distress being caused to the patients and the paramedics operating those ambulances. Their business is saving lives. They have done that and have got the patient to the hospital, only to face a backlog. The working conditions are utterly unacceptable. Their business is saving lives; that is what they signed up to do. To be clear, my point is that there is not an adequate ambulance service in County Donegal. I do not think there is a recognition of the unique geography of the county. The paramedics who work in the service are under unbelievable pressure. That must be dealt with and Letterkenny University Hospital must be helped to tackle the crisis in beds, nurses and doctors. The two crises in the ambulance service and the acute hospital in Letterkenny lead to impossible working conditions for the front-line emergency workers who are working there. They are being failed and it is not acceptable. I appeal to the Minister to examine the issue with his colleagues and to make it clear to the National Ambulance Service and the Saolta Hospital Group.	spk_254

It is a map the Northern and Western Regional Assembly published a number of years ago. If one looks at it the deficit in infrastructure in the north-west of Ireland, working its way down to the west, is very clear. Let us look at it. There is no motorway network to the fourth largest city on the island, Derry, and County Donegal. There are about 500,000 people in the cross-Border region of west County Tyrone, County Donegal and County Derry. There is no rail connection and no motorway connection.For the past ten years, the Government has starved the City of Derry Airport although 40% of the passengers who go through it come from Donegal. It has got no funding from the Government for the past ten years. Funding was removed when the Derry to Dublin airport link was taken down. There is no road or motorway infrastructure, no rail and no air connecting approximately half the county of Donegal and all of Derry. It is stunning. It is the same for electricity infrastructure. We have said this for many years. This motion is so important because we in the west and north west of Ireland do not have a motorway or rail connection joining up the west of Ireland. Cork, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Derry and that huge mass of population in the west has no motorway connectivity for nearly all of it and no rail connectivity for a big part of it. That has to be the priority, but from reading the national development plan it is not at all clear to me that this Government gets the scale of the neglect of the west and north west of my county of Donegal, right down to Cork. It needs to be addressed and prioritised. I agree with Deputy Calleary that we now need a committee to come to grips with this because successive Governments and senior civil servants have failed to do so. We need a sense of urgency and an investment plan. We need to work with the likes of the Northern and Western Regional Assembly, which has no political axe to grind. Its members are just speaking the truth. I will hold up the map again to show the damning indictment of the failure of our people in the west and north west.	spk_267

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-11-03	dail	33	Post-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_16	I am going to reiterate some of the points I made to the Taoiseach earlier about the reality of what is happening around our coast today. I will put it back on the record. The Irish fishing fleet is allocated 15% of the quota in fish in our own waters under the Common Fisheries Policy. The other 85% is allocated to the fishing fleets of other EU member states. This is under the relative stability principle, a principle that dates back to the 1970s, when Ireland joined the EU as it is today. What does this mean? It means that we are not getting fair share of the fish in our own waters. We talk about climate change. I am talking about the fish that are closest to our piers and harbours. Because we are not getting that fair share, we are losing thousands of jobs in coastal communities and hundreds of millions of euro each year. That is a conservative estimate. It is having a devastating impact on coastal communities.  Since 2006, the number of boats in the Irish fleet that are over 15 m in length has been reduced by a third. If the Irish Government gets its way, another 60 vessels will be decommissioned, as per the recommendation in the report of the seafood sector task force. It is a  I am beyond appealing at this stage. I beg the Government to get a plan together, go to Europe and fight for our fair share. I ask the Government not to make me come here again before and after the next meeting of the EU Council and make the same speech. I ask for some words of reassurance today.	spk_284
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-11-03	dail	33	Finance Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_19	I had the opportunity earlier today to raise again with the Taoiseach the crisis in our fishing industry. What has caused this? If we look at our waters under the jurisdiction of the Common Fisheries Policy, 15% of the fish quota in these waters has been allocated to the Irish fishing fleet every year for years. The other 85% is given to the fishing fleets of other European member states. This is based on what is called relative stability and based on the fishing practices of the 1970s. This has been allowed to happen. The impact is devastating. I have been visiting piers and harbours along our coast as Sinn Féin's spokesperson on fisheries and the marine. I have spoken to fishers and their families along the coast. The despair is growing. The impact of the Brexit trade agreement has meant a further cut to the quota of 15%, which has an impact of €43 million per year. The fact we have not confronted the utter injustice in the Common Fisheries Policy leaves us with the loss of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of euro each year. What other European country would tolerate a 15% take for its own fleet? We speak about climate change. Whose boats are closest to those waters? I want to set the context of what I want to raise with the Minister on the Finance Bill. I want the Minister to consider the issue of tax relief for fishers and the issues of wear and tear, fuel costs, repairs and climate measures. Costs continue to be raised at every pier and harbour. Fishers are self-employed and they have no tax relief. The Minister has made provision for the farming community and the film industry. I am not pitting industry against industry as these provisions are right and proper but the fishing industry is the most under the cosh in the State. It is the one that suffered most in the Brexit debacle. I raised this through a parliamentary question and the Minister spoke about considering it and tax expenditure guidelines. He said it was key. He said where there are demonstrable market failures, tax-based incentives should only be considered where they would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. This is the industry that is the most under the cosh. These are the people who are struggling to stay in the water. They have been failed by the macro policy of the State. They feel they have been sacrificed for other priorities. I ask the Minister to look at this area of the fishing community. I ask him to speak to his colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, to see what he can do at the next opportunity to address this issue of tax reliefs to provide another bit of assistance to them. I have raised the wider issue with the Taoiseach and let him fight for that. Within the Minister's responsibility I ask him to deal with this.	spk_381

He might take the opportunity to go out and meet the children who have been waiting for him for the past hour and a half. I am disappointed I did not get the chance to make the following statement before the Taoiseach left the Chamber. The Taoiseach alleged that he was not invited to meet protesters. He was sent an email, as were other Ministers. The Taoiseach clearly was invited but he chose not to attend. Hopefully, when he gets a chance, he will correct the record in that regard.He might even take the chance now as he leaves. The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, usually takes these statements and in fairness, it is usually him who receives the comments. That is why I was surprised to see the Taoiseach stay so long today rather than go out and meet the children at the front of these buildings, which I would say, according to anybody listening in to these debates across the country, was his top priority and responsibility today. On the challenges the Government faces, my colleague and party leader, Deputy McDonald, has referenced fisheries. There is a seething anger across fishing and coastal communities at the ongoing failure to ensure there will be burden-sharing of the quota loss that arises from the EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement. As the Minister of State is aware, in some cases, especially with mackerel, there is a huge loss of quota that has a devastating impact. That is why the Government is suggesting 60 more vessels will have to be decommissioned. It is because of the failure of Government after Government to secure a fair share of the fish in our own waters. The Government has not secured burden-sharing despite repeated assurances it would seek it. The EU Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries was in Ireland recently. When the question was put to him, it was clear we had not put any pressure on him to agree to burden-sharing of the quota loss that would have prevented the need to decommission these 60 vessels. Right now, Irish fishermen around our coast can only attain 15% of the fish in our waters under the Common Fisheries Policy. If that was not bad enough, we now have an additional hit from that trade agreement. This is ongoing. We are the laughing stock of Europe. When we talk to MEPs and senior politicians in Europe privately, they cannot believe we allow this situation to continue. It is a profound injustice. We talk about all the legislation we are bringing in around the marine at the moment, the immense resource it is and the potential for coastal communities. What has more potential than the fish in our own waters? We have a situation where on the south coast, our boats are tied up while day after day, Spanish, French and Belgian boats land fish at our harbours, with no checks from the Sea-Fisheries Protection Agency, SFPA, to be exported back to their own country. There is no value, no checks and no equality for the fishermen there. I am asking for the Minister of State, along with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, to get some fire in their bellies and stand up and fight for Irish fishermen. That is their challenge.	spk_303

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-10-07	dail	33	Recovery of Tourism and Aviation: Statements	dbsect_35	I raise the issue of the funding of the City of Derry Airport or, to be more exact, the lack of funding by the Irish Government and its recent predecessors. Derry city is the fourth largest city on this island. It is a part of the north west city region of Donegal, Derry city and Strabane and has a population of 300,000. It has been battered by partition but has fantastic leaders. No matter where people come from on the political spectrum, we have united to make the case for our region and access to it. In recent years, we have had major setbacks with the A5 project. The legal delays to this dual carriageway project from Donegal to Derry city, through Tyrone and on to Monaghan and our capital city have been heartbreaking. The project has hit a wall but I believe we can get it back on track in the near future. We also have no rail connectivity from Donegal and Derry directly to our capital city, or to the west, for that matter. The map of the connectivity of Ireland shows a stark picture. That is why it is shocking that Irish Governments continue to refuse financial support to the City of Derry Airport. Some 40% of the passengers passing through the airport come from Donegal and our Government makes no financial contribution towards it. Derry City and Strabane District Council has been carrying the can for the airport for years with no support from the Irish Government. The Stormont Executive has been funding it and the British Government has been contributing. Shamefully, our Government has abandoned the airport for ten years now. I have received responses from the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton. I appreciate she has inherited this issue and I hope she will take a fresh perspective on it. In a response to me recently, she talked about the context of the New Decade, New Approach agreement and indicated she would carry out reviews of the potential of the Belfast-Cork and Derry-Dublin routes. I thank her for those responses and the proposed reviews. I am sure she understands, as a woman from the regions, that it is unthinkable and unacceptable for a region of 300,000 people to have no motorway, rail or air connectivity to our capital city. This has been going on for far too long. Like all airports, the City of Derry Airport lost a huge amount of business due to Covid, but it is up and moving again. I am delighted to have the opportunity to directly make this statement to the Minister of State. What has happened is totally wrong. We talk about all-Ireland development and working together but we have abandoned Derry City and Strabane District Council to run an airport when 40% of its passengers are from Donegal. That is wrong and must stop. I appeal to the Minister of State to find a solution to this problem.	spk_243
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-10-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	As the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is aware, thousands of families from the west of Ireland have had their lives torn asunder by the mica and pyrite scandal. Their homes are crumbling around them. This is a national disaster. It is an earthquake happening in slow motion. The trail of devastation winds its way through communities that share the sorrow and anger of their families, friends and neighbours. These communities range from my own in north County Donegal, down through counties Sligo, Mayo and on to Clare, Limerick and Tipperary. On Friday, the families and their supporters will again descend on Dublin to protest to get the Government to deliver 100% redress. They should not have to do this. On June 15, the very day the families last protested in Dublin, this Dáil unanimously passed a motion instructing the Government to provide 100% redress. Four months ago, these families should have seen their nightmare finally brought to an end. It is a nightmare that has taken a heavy financial toll on them. There has been financial ruin, emotional breakdown and a real sense of abandonment by the State. Here we are in October, and the families are left with no other option but to again travel to the capital and shout as loudly as possible for the Government to hear them. Full 100% redress is the only just solution. It must cover the cost of demolition and rebuilding because that is the reality facing so many of our families. Their homes must be demolished because the blocks used in their construction are crumbling like Weetabix biscuits. In many cases, only demolition and rebuilding will ensure a safe home in many cases. The Government cannot walk away from this truth. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Deputies in the six affected counties see that truth. They all support 100% redress. Has the Minister spoken to them all? Have they told him what they have witnessed? Have they explained the condition of these houses and the misery of the families? If they have, and if he has listened, there is no way the full cost of demolition and rebuilding will be left out of redress. Last July, in a deeply moving video, You think heartbreak. You think that it is something with a starting point and a finishing point. But this just drags on for years and years. There is no end and there is no end in sight ... The Minister has it in his power to bring an end to the families' agony. He can tell them they do not need to come to Dublin as they will have 100% redress. He may not have all the details but surely he can give them that assurance. The families are not going away. They have risen above the trauma and have found their strength, and it is powerful. They have won the hearts and minds of the people because the people know what is right. Do not force them to come to Dublin again this Friday. Do the right thing. End their agony. Tell them they will have 100% redress.	spk_52

The Minister is very familiar with the pyrite resolution scheme under which over 2,000 families in Dublin and north Leinster rightly received 100% redress. They did nothing wrong but were failed by the absence of State regulation and oversight. Our families in Donegal, Mayo, Sligo, Clare, Limerick and Tipperary deserve exactly the same, namely, 100% redress. The Government must send out a clear message that all of our families, no matter where they live, did nothing wrong, were profoundly failed by this State and will be treated exactly the same and that the State will learn lessons from all of this. We will learn lessons and make sure that our laws are updated and this never happens again. The families will protest on Friday and I hope to God it is the last time they have to come to this city to protest and that they get the justice they deserve.

On the same day, this House passed a motion, which no Deputy opposed, calling for 100% redress for families who have been devastated by defective concrete blocks. The scheme that is in place was supposed to provide 90%, with the banks making a large contribution towards the remaining 10%. Of course, the banks ran away and were nowhere to be seen, and the figure is anything but 90%. The Minister's working group has been established but the families did not have a good experience with that group. His departmental officials, as is in the DNA of departmental officials, are focused on limiting the exposure of the State. That is their mindset in these discussions. The families, meanwhile, have been focused on solutions. They have made their final submission to the Minister. They have put a great deal of work into it and it is based on a costing per square metre by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland. The Government has asked what 100% redress would mean and the families have demonstrated what can be done based on real-world prices, but they have also demonstrated the need for a State guarantee. If we are saying to families that, in many instances, they are not required to demolish their homes and that removing the outer leaf would be a safe option, as is the view of the engineers who put together the protocol for the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the State needs to guarantee that work. People will embrace that if there is a guarantee and an assurance is in place.  They are the two big calls, namely, for 100% redress and a State guarantee in respect of any works that take place. The families who stayed with the process, even though they were not happy at all, have made the submission and presented it to Members in the Houses in the past week, as the Minister will be aware. They have done tremendous work and I am hopeful he will back their report and deliver the solution so many families badly need.	spk_209

There are more than 20,000 people in a county of 160,000 on the waiting list. That amounts to one in eight. I am not even including Sligo hospital, whose waiting list includes people from south Donegal. That is a damning indictment of Government after Government. The issue for Letterkenny University Hospital is that despite its being the sixth largest hospital in the State, and its having had more than 24,000 inpatients before the pandemic, it is ranked 13th when it comes to the budget. Some allowances can be made for the fact that the major hospitals in Dublin and Galway are dealing with additional specialities but how can we explain the circumstances whereby budgets in the major hospitals are two to three times greater per capita than in Letterkenny University Hospital? I was asked to get these figures by senior hospital staff in Letterkenny because they felt the only way to get to the bottom of this was through parliamentary questions. What is happening is a scandal. There has to be acceptance in the HSE that Donegal is treated like a backwater. It means real impacts in Donegal, where people are forced to travel huge distances for basic procedures unnecessarily. We should have the specialities in Letterkenny University Hospital, the sixth largest hospital in the State. People should not have to travel long distances. This is about equality of access to healthcare. I ask the Minister to examine this. I am going to send to him directly all the statistics I have gathered on this.	spk_265

These families have campaigned long and hard for this Government to do what is fair and deliver 100% redress. The Tánaiste lectured those families, who are going through hell, about the burden that a fair and just scheme would place on taxpayers. He included a smart alec quip about it not being the Government's money. How dare he? The Tánaiste never gave such lectures to the families in Dublin and north Leinster who rightly and justly received 100% redress when their homes were severely impacted by pyrite. The families in the west of Ireland have been treated like second-class citizens. They have been denied a fully-funded 100% redress scheme. This is completely unacceptable and leaves families who have done nothing wrong with massive bills that they cannot afford to pay. Such glib comments, attempting to turn public opinion, have a devastating impact on these families. It creates an anxiety and a fear that those leading this Government do not hear them and will not do the right thing. Minister, you have to do the right thing. We are talking about people whose homes are literally crumbling around them. These are families who worked hard, paid their taxes and saved hard to buy their homes. Now, through no fault of their own, they find themselves in a horrific situation where their houses are cracking and coming asunder around them. The human toll of this ordeal has been heartbreaking. This has led to unbearable mental distress for families. I know families and people who have been close to emotional breakdown. These people are close to financial ruin. They say that their very lives have crumbled around them with their homes. For them, the dream has turned into a living nightmare. I live in Buncrana, the epicentre of this disaster in north Donegal. This scandal has left deep scars on our community. It is agonising to see neighbours, friends and family suffer in this way. I do not think I have the words to convey to the Minister the trauma these families are going through, but I need him to listen to me here and now. This needs to be brought to an end. The families have made their final submission to the working group. The Minister must surely know the key asks the campaigners and families have made. The Government cannot keep standing idly by. The families demand a scheme that covers the full cost of rebuilding their homes. That is right and just. As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister has the power to bring incredible positive change to the lives of families who have been through this living hell. I am asking him on behalf of those families to do the right thing. Will he tell them today that the Government will deliver 100% redress?	spk_81

Where do I start with all of this? The Minister of State knows that this has been a deeply controversial saga. It has gone to the Supreme Court and the previous Ministers and the Department were found to have wronged fishermen on a number of occasions. They repeatedly did not listen to the industry. If they had listened, what the industry has been saying is that it of course supports the implementation of a penalty points scheme but it has to be fair, just and equitable. That is what they have said right throughout. I am going to go through some of their main concerns. As the Minister of State knows, the previous Minister, Deputy Creed, attempted to bring in a statutory instrument which, for the first time in the history of the State, was voted down in this House. It was the then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on the marine, Pat the Cope Gallagher, who brought in that annulment motion. It won the support of the House and the statutory instrument was annulled. That was the right thing to do. Those of us who supported that annulment motion were all shocked to see the Taoiseach, who was then the acting Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, introduce a statutory instrument identical to the one that was voted out by this House. He went against his own previous spokesperson on the marine, Pat the Cope Gallagher, who I believe listened to the industry, worked with it and defined solid solutions. He actually presented a solution to the Department officials and the Minister but he was ignored. It was shocking that his own Taoiseach ignored him and then the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, brought that statutory instrument forward again. We then brought an annulment motion that, unfortunately, was not successful to try to stop it. Did the Government learn any lessons from that whole episode? Absolutely not. It has now brought in this legislation, which has the same serious flaws in it as the statutory instrument that is now operational. It brought this legislation, which is fundamentally flawed, to the Oireachtas committee and that all-party committee corresponded with the Minister and pointed out two issues in particular. The first is the issue of the balance of probabilities. What person or citizen in this State would accept a conviction that could have such a detrimental impact on their livelihood on the balance of probabilities, rather than on the threshold that we all understand, which is that of beyond a reasonable doubt? It is extraordinary that the Government would allow that threshold. That says it all about the attitude of some people in officialdom in Ireland, who I believe have a view that fishermen are guilty until proven innocent. It is a criminalisation of a whole industry when there is a threshold of the balance of probabilities rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. If that was not good enough, there is also the fact that people can only appeal to the High Court on a point of law. This issue has been through the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court found that a person has the right to appeal when it impacts on their livelihood. That would be the vessel owner in the case of the statutory instrument and the master of the vessel in this case. However, they can only appeal to the High Court on a point of law. That is bad enough but it gets worse. If a person did go to the High Court on that point of law and was successful, that would not mean the points would be removed. It is absolutely extraordinary. I have said this at the committee. Imagine if we told our citizens that if a speed van or a garda allegedly caught them speeding while driving along in their car and they decided to take it to court and won their case, the points would still stay on their licence. If we had a law like that people would be in uproar throughout the land and it would not see the light of day but that is how we treat our fishermen. I assume the Minister of State and the officials have read the submissions from the various fishing organisations to the Oireachtas committee. All these points were put forward again in those submissions, but did the Government listen to the fishing organisations, or the all-party committee that corresponded with it and expressed profound concern about these aspects of this legislation? The answer is ""No"". It did not listen. Here we are now with flawed legislation that is offensive to fishermen up and down the coast. Sinn Féin will oppose it at every Stage and will seek to put in amendments to get the Government to see sense, to treat the fishermen with respect and to bring in a points system that is fair, just and equitable."	spk_151
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-09-15	dail	33	Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_15	My colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, has substantively responded to the Bill on behalf of our party. My responsibility, as our fisheries spokesperson, is to speak for the fishermen I am engaging with up and down the coast. The Minister will know from the protest held outside the convention centre in recent times that there is real anger across our coastal communities that they have not historically received their fair share of the fish in our waters. Of course, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement made that situation worse with another 15% of our quota lost, resulting in tens of millions lost every year. To put that into context, we have at least 12% of the entirety of the waters within the European Union but get 4% of the fish. What does that mean? It means we lose thousands and thousands of jobs in coastal communities every year and hundreds of millions of euros. That is the context in which the Minister is presenting this proposition to fishermen. There is a distrust of those in positions of political leadership because of historical failures. I have spoken to fishermen up and down the coast about this issue. Of course, they are not opposed to offshore energy generation. They are intelligent people. They understand we need to meet the State's responsibilities. They merely ask to be genuinely consulted and that their traditional fishing grounds be respected. I understand the industry states this is also its desire. The task facing the Minister in this legislation is to ensure there are robust measures in place regarding consultation, especially with coastal and fishing communities, so that they will genuinely be partners in this process. They are not there to prevent the establishment of offshore energy projects in this State. They just want to make sure they can fish. A comment has struck me again and again. I put to some fishermen the idea of increased financial supports when they are tied up. They are increasingly forced to fish for lobster and crab. Access to mackerel, herring and other fish such as spurdog has been denied to them, so they are squeezed more and more. I talked about financial supports and subsidies and it struck me that people on a number of piers said they just want to fish like those who came before them. Of course, they want to do so sustainably. They asked for officials of the Marine Institute to go out with them and officials of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority to come out to the pier to examine what they are landing. They said they just want to fish sustainably. That is all our coastal communities want to do. I believe we can do both. These ideas are not in conflict with one another. The marine resource is immense. The protection of marine biodiversity is the responsibility of all. I appeal to the Minister, as did my colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, to get this legislation right. There have obviously been substantive submissions from inshore fishermen's organisations and others into this process. I ask that, at the various stages, these groups are heard and engaged with. If we do this right, we might get legislation which strikes the right balance and does justice to all stakeholders.	spk_193

The Irish people have never recognised or accepted Britain's claim to Rockall. Tonight, without any real debate, the Irish Government, led by a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, will sign away Irish sovereignty and, with it, our historic fishing rights at Rockall. This is utterly shameful. At a time when the entire industry is fighting for its very survival, the action the Government is taking tonight will put the future of many fishing families on the line. We will not accept the ceding of Irish sovereignty to Britain. I am asking the Taoiseach to stand up for his country and intervene to stop this legislation going before the Oireachtas tonight.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-07-14	dail	33	Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_30	The Minister has put forward the subject of honesty and I am glad he has done so. Let us go through facts in detail. It is true that there were a number of agreements between the Irish Government and the British Government on the area around Rockall, culminating in the 2013 agreement. It was signed in 2013 and then laid before the Houses in 2014. The Minister says that the Government always protests that a rock that is uninhabited cannot generate an EEZ and a continental shelf. However, it can generate a 12-mile limit. An array of legal experts are clear that the Government's repeated ceding of the territory around Rockall allows the British to generate a 12-mile limit around it. Here is the problem. For the past seven months, fishermen from Donegal have tried to exercise their traditional fishing rights. They have been denied and blocked from doing so. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Agriculture, Food and the Marine have failed to resolve this issue. Why have they not taken this for international arbitration or made a counter-claim on that territory? Iceland does not recognise the 2013 agreement. Iceland and Denmark do not recognise British control over Rockall but our Government does. The problem is that the 2013 agreement was never taken in these Houses for debate. I will bring the Minister's attention to the ruling of the Supreme Court in the Barlow case of 2016. Seven Supreme Court judges stated the following:In constitutional terms, it means that the Constitution requires that the regulation of natural resources stated to be the property of the State must be the subject of a decision by the representatives of the People who are accountable to them. [I will continue] Legislation is normally required to take place in public (Article 15.8), which carries with it the possibility of public knowledge and debate. In effect, therefore, the Constitution mandates that if State property, in particular natural resources, is to be sold, leased, managed or regulated, then that decision should be made in public by representatives who are accountable to the People who can accordingly make their views known. It follows in my view, that the Court should take a strict approach to the requirements of Article 10.3 which ensures compliance both with the text and the underlying rationale of the Article.Clearly the 2013 and 2014 agreement did not comply with that standard and I put it to the Minister that it is unconstitutional. The Minister talked about truth and facts. Let us go to page 10 of his legislation where it clearly states:The Maritime Jurisdiction (Boundaries of Exclusive Economic Zone) Order 2014 (S.I. No. 86 of 2014) shall continue in operation and have effect on and after the commencement of...I will not read the rest. The Government is putting that agreement, which was never debated in these Houses, into law. It is putting on a legal or constitutional footing that which did not have a legal or constitutional footing before. That was an opportunity for the Government on two levels. It was unconstitutional and it had no strong legal footing, just like the voisinage agreement before it. That is why the Government had to legislate for the voisinage agreement to come into effect. That is what happened. I remember that debate well. With the 2014 agreement, the Government could argue with some degree of defence that it was under the jurisdiction of the Common Fisheries Policy. However, the area the Government has ceded to Britain around Rockall is now part of its territorial waters and it has put in place a 12-mile limit. Why would the Government not take that to international arbitration? It has failed to get our Donegal fishermen back fishing in their traditional grounds for the last seven months. It has not stood up to the British Government on or defended our sovereign interests in this matter. It has meekly allowed that to happen. The British Government is blocking our Donegal fishermen from accessing their traditional fishing grounds for seven months and the Government did not take it to international arbitration. There was no legal basis in Irish law for that to happen. The Government could have challenged it but instead it made what is happening there legal under Irish law. The Government undermines its own case even further. Those are the facts and the truth and every fisherman in this country knows it. It is time this Government grew a backbone and stood up for our interests and defended them. It is outrageous that the Taoiseach stood up here today when I asked him to withdraw this legislation and denied what is in black and white. There is not a single objective person in this country reading that Bill who can deny that the Government is putting on a legal and constitutional footing what was not legal or constitutional before. It is undeniable and shameful that the Government is backing down and not standing up for our interests. The Taoiseach should be ashamed of himself for his response today.	spk_566
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-07-14	dail	33	Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_44	I find it extraordinary and very worrying that the Minister has put in these conditions. When it was confirmed with the campaigning families in Donegal that at long last, after years and years, they were going to be exempt from the property tax, they said it was a positive gesture, but there are more substantive issues. I note the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, is present. I refer to the 100% redress and all of the other imbalances between the scheme that was rightly made available to the campaigning families in Dublin and Leinster after a long campaign but was not extended to Donegal and Mayo. Let us talk about the defective concrete blocks grant scheme. Under the scheme, one has to source an engineer who takes a core extraction from the house. The sample is sent away to be tested in a laboratory and after it has been analysed, an engineering recommendation is made to Donegal County Council in the case of houses in Donegal. The cost ranges from €5,000 to €7,000. Those costs were rightly taken care of in the pyrite remediation scheme by the Pyrite Resolution Board. People face a charge of between €5,000 and €7,000. The local property tax is a self-assessment tax. An individual is responsible for assessing the value of his or her home. Surely to God these amendments are entirely reasonable. People would declare that they believe their home to be affected by mica in Donegal or pyrite in Mayo. That means their home cannot be insured. That is not something people want to do, and it is not something anyone would happily or readily do. It is a big declaration to make. We are saying that if a person self-declares that his or her home is impacted by this, he or she should not be liable for the property tax. That is only fair that it would be the case. People are really hurting in Donegal and Mayo. People are also hurting in counties Clare and Sligo, who are not yet able to benefit from the scheme. They have been failed by the State in its oversight responsibilities and in more recent years in market surveillance. The concrete block is the core component of the family home in the vast majority of houses in this State. I cannot think of a more important item that a person or a builder could purchase than concrete blocks to build a home. Is there a more important purchase? Could there have been a more important product that the State was ensuring was built to the best possible standard? We abandoned people to self-regulation, light-touch regulation and no regulation. The State abandoned people and failed them. After years of campaigning, it put in place a scheme for families in Dublin. The scheme is not perfect, but it is a scheme they were entitled to. After years in Donegal and following an independent expert panel report we ended up with the present scheme. I know the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has probably advised the Minister for Finance that the working group is going to advance these issues. That is welcome if it happens, but what we need is a 100% fully funded scheme. We need rents to be covered while people are out of their home. We need the upfront costs to be covered. If the advice is to remove the outer leaf of a house and that goes wrong, people must have a State guarantee on it. Fundamentally, we need a fully-funded scheme. I am pleased both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage are present. The Minister must accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Doherty and me. It is the least he can do. It would be a positive gesture that we trust people to visually self-assess that their home is impacted and that they will be exempt from the property tax. That would be a positive signal if the Minister could do that. I appeal to both Ministers present, and also to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath. This is perfect. The three Ministers, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage are present. I am sure every other Member of this House will join me in this. We appeal to them to put in place a fully funded scheme to make up for the years of State failure, to get these families moving forward. I appeal that we would do that together in a positive way. The deadline is 31 July. If we get to that with really good news, I hope we can come back in September. It starts tonight. It is a positive signal if the Minister accepts the amendment. It is a common-sense amendment and I trust the Minister will do it. He will do what is right up until 31 July and then the State will make some recompense to all of those families that were failed over the years.	spk_609

I commend the Deputy on the graphs providing a visual display of the utter injustice in terms of the allocation of quota to the Irish fishing fleet. The current percentage of Irish waters that are within the overall jurisdiction of the Common Fisheries Policy is 12%. We have 12% of the waters but we were allocated 4% of the overall quota. What we are actually receiving is one third of what we should get on the basis of our proportion of the seas. What does that mean in real terms? It means hundreds of millions of euro lost every year. It means thousands of jobs in jeopardy. As the Minister is aware, the industry currently supports approximately 16,000 jobs overall. If we are getting one third of what we ought to be getting, one could argue that tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of euro will be lost because of the Government's repeated failure at least to try to renegotiate the Common Fisheries Policy and stand up with regard to what has happened here. The Common Fisheries Policy is based on relative stability. In other words, it is based on the practices that were in existence when we entered the European Economic Community, as it was back then. Even though the capacity of our industry has grown, we have to adhere to the allocation based on the situation as it pertained many decades ago. How unjust and unfair is that? One sees the implications when one considers the species. That is jobs and revenue lost to our coastal communities, many of which could desperately do with that extra fight. The truth is that when it comes to fisheries policy, everybody who has operated in Brussels through the years and interacted with it knows that we are the laughing stock of Europe. They just cannot believe that we have wilfully handed away so much of our own natural resources and the potential wealth of our coastal communities. It is such a sorry thing to say that we are the laughing stock of Europe in that regard. They cannot believe that we keep doing it year in, year out. This is all in the context of the EU-UK trade agreement. Ireland, the country that is a victim of the Common Fisheries Policy in real terms, has been hit with another 15% of our quota cut, considerably more than any other fishing fleet, and €43 million per year lost. Here we are, almost six months later, and there is no evidence of burden-sharing. Where is the fight from the Government for a fair outcome after the EU-UK trade agreement, especially considering what I have just said about the historical approach of Europe? I refer to bluefin tuna. Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan was right to raise that issue. The situation in respect of bluefin tuna is an absolute scandal. It is one of the most lucrative fish in the world. Thanks to species management internationally, it has been recovering in recent times. It is plentiful in Irish waters but we have zero allocation of quota: nothing. To add insult to injury, we are allowed to catch and release, so one can catch the fish with tourists and just release them again. We are involved in scientific surveys. For Christ's sake, it is unbelievable. The fishing fleet of the European Union has had an increase of 78% - tens of thousands of tonnes - in the quota of bluefin tuna in recent years, but we have not been allocated a single fish. Imagine what it would do for our inshore fishing fleet if they were to be given some of that quota. Who is fighting for us? Who is making this case? It is absolutely astonishing. Senior officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have stood over this approach for many years under Minister after Minister. We do not have a dedicated Minister of State for the marine, never mind an actual dedicated Minster for the marine at Cabinet. We are the only island nation in the European Union but we do not have a dedicated Minister who would only focus on the marine and could deal with these senior departmental officials and get them to shape up and fight for a fair share of resources for this country. It is astonishing. The situation in respect of bluefin tuna alone tells one everything one needs to know about what is going on in terms of the State fighting for our people. The seafood task force has been established. I have spoken to many people who are participating on it. It is critically important that if it has agreed in good faith an approach we need to take, that approach is implemented with heart and soul and fire and passion. We have ground and time to make up and we need to fight hard for our interests at European level. That is critical. I refer to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority. My God, if anything represents what is going on in fishing communities and what has gone wrong for so long, it is the performance of the SFPA. As the Minister is aware, PwC did an analysis of that organisation. It concluded the SFPA is dysfunctional, not fit for purpose and in need of urgent reform. The utter failure to make that organisation work effectively in partnership with and with respect for fishermen and fish producers around the island has led to the disaster relating to the weighing system process. In my opinion, based on the conversations I have had with fishermen around the coast, the SFPA views our fishing community as if they are criminals. It assumes the fishers are guilty unless they can prove themselves innocent. That is the type of culture that is there. Oversight and regulation are important. We need to protect our precious resource and prevent overfishing. I recently visited a fish factory in Killybegs and I saw fish being landed at the harbour onto a trailer with water that took them a short distance to the factory. I saw the fish being weighed on a state-of-the-art and sealed weighing system with which only the SFPA can tamper. The National Standards Authority of Ireland can come in unannounced at any time to see whether the weighing system is doing what it is supposed to be doing, but that was not enough. That is a lot of oversight. There are CCTV cameras all around the factory, looking down at this weighing system as the fish go over it. Those CCTV cameras beam directly to the offices of the SFPA. I cannot think of any other industry with that level of oversight, where the staff of the regulator can literally watch the entire process happening for as long as they want. If that is not enough, they can come into the factory and look at the production end, where there is a trolley of fish in boxes. Each box weighs 20 kg and there are 60 boxes on the trolley, so that is a total of 1.2 tonnes. One can go into the freezer system. My God, if you want to regulate them, you can regulate them. You can regulate them to the nth degree. In fact, our seafood sector is the most regulated in all of Europe. How in God's name did we get to a situation where we have allowed the European Union and the European Commission to reach a conclusion that Irish fishers have overfished and are involved in widespread illegality? Where is the evidence? A whole industry has been accused of overfishing but it has not been given the evidence. I submitted a parliamentary question on the matter to the Minister and his departmental officials said it cannot be released. My God. Can the Minister imagine a person being accused of a crime - the fishermen are being accused of a crime - and found guilty but not given the evidence? The person is punished but was not given the evidence, so never had a chance to defend himself.The report was leaked to a number of organisations, which have behaved deeply unfairly by putting it into the public domain. It was leaked to the media and certain organisations but was not given to the people who are facing accusations. Flowing from that is the utter disaster that is the SFPA and the way it has conducted itself on matters affecting people living on our coasts. It is a dysfunctional organisation. We now have a situation where every fisherman must weigh his or her catch, including non-quota species, on the pier or harbour. Fishermen have to take the fish out of the iceboxes to do so. Christ almighty, seafood regulations state that the cold chain must be protected. The fish must be stored at the required temperature the whole way through the process and that must be guaranteed in respect of any sales that are made. Bord Iascaigh Mhara is a good organisation that is trying to promote Irish seafood across the world and work with the industry to develop technology and standards. It is trying to promote the tremendous seafood we have in this country. However, fishermen are being told to take the fish out of the iceboxes and keep it in the open heat before putting it back again. A system has been imposed that puts fishermen at an utter disadvantage relative to their competitors and undermines all the work of BIM. One arm of the State is fundamentally undermining another arm of the State that is progressive and effective. The Government has never got a grip on the senior officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the SFPA. This is happening on the Minister's watch. He is a Donegal man from a coastal community. He has been told at every single meeting he has attended around the coast what the issues are. I commend him on the town hall meetings he conducted. That engagement was a good initiative. The Minister heard from the horse's mouth that the officials are completely out of sync with the communities with which they are supposed to work. I will draw an analogy to illustrate the point I am making. When it comes to policing, a garda who treats people with respect and uses common sense is a garda who is respected in the community. He or she enforces the law while also explaining the law and respecting people in the community. People will work with gardaí like that. However, where a garda treats people with contempt and like criminals from the start, and looks down his or her nose at them, then we have ineffective policing. That is what the SFPA has become. The agency was handed a template in Killybegs and I cannot believe it has not presented it to the European Commission and said: ""Look at the standard of regulation we have reached and the level of oversight we have in being able to watch people on CCTV and monitor what they are doing closely."" The Minister needs to get a grip on the senior officials in his Department and the SFPA. The seafood sector task force and the town hall meetings are the right way to go. He has heard what needs to be heard. As a fellow Donegal man who, like the Minister, has spoken to fishermen and people in all these coastal communities, I say to him it is time for big change. It is time for the Minister to deal with his officials and tell them straight he needs them to fight for Ireland and do everything they can to rectify the wrongs that were done. The Department needs to show the fishermen and fish producers it has their back and will fight for them with all its might and main. If the Minister can achieve that, he may be able to deal with the protesting fishermen who are coming to Dublin next Wednesday and show them he is making a difference. There were protestors here last week and there will be more next week. If the Minister can deal with the issues both those sets of protestors are putting to him, he can look back on his days in government with great pride."	spk_219

The case of the national marine planning framework was extraordinary because many years of work went into its preparation, yet Government members of the Oireachtas committee voted to push it through without further scrutiny. Environmental NGOs and inshore fishermen wanted to have their say on the final plan being submitted to Europe, which was an entirely reasonable position, but the framework was just pushed through. We were told it was urgent but it was several weeks before it was voted through the Dáil. There was plenty of time for further scrutiny but the Government decided to rush it through. Similarly, there is a sense that this legislation is being pushed through without proper scrutiny. I have spoken to interests in the fishing community and environmental NGOs, which are seriously concerned this legislation will come through, I assume by next week, without their having had their say before a committee to which they can make structured submissions. Sinn Féin will submit a range of amendments based on our consultation with those different interests. In the area of environmental concerns, we will introduce a range of amendments seeking clarification on the parameters and powers of the State, but also seeking to make the State accountable. I will focus on a couple of areas in particular and talk about Rockall. In 2013-14, the Government of the day signed an agreement that was not debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas. The agreement copper-fastened this State's acceptance of British control of the Rockall area. We protest that an uninhabited island cannot have a 12-mile limit put around it. However, fishermen from Donegal are being physically prevented from fishing in the 12-mile limit around Rockall. Marine Scotland and the British navy has intervened and prevented them from fishing within that area. The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, has checked with these fishermen to make sure they are not fishing within that 12-mile limit. The Government states that, having made this agreement in 2013-14, it does not accept the 12-mile claim, yet here we are, after Brexit, dealing with just that issue. Every time I submit a parliamentary question to the Minister, he tells me talks are ongoing. It has been almost six months since Brexit and still our fishermen cannot fish within the 12-mile limit. Remember, we have a historical claim going back hundreds of years. Our connection with that territory goes back to Gaelic civilisation. We had not claimed it and that was a mistake. Our failure to challenge the British claim and instead to adhere to it in 1989 and 2013-14 was a huge mistake. In the amendments I will submit, I will clearly state that the 2013-14 agreement made between the British and Irish Governments is null and void because of Brexit. Brexit changed everything. The defence at that time was they were managed European waters that fell under the Common Fisheries Policy. People asked what the issue was. However, they are now UK territorial waters and the UK authorities are claiming a 12-mile limit of exclusive rights around the rock of Rockall. This cannot stand. What does the Government do? It brings in legislation to copper-fasten that agreement. It is remarkable. It is copper-fastening the agreement, rather than making the case for why we should be standing up to an extremely arrogant claim. When I am on the subject of arrogance, a few short years ago, the British Secretary of State, in response to a parliamentary question, stated the UK claimed the entirety of Lough Foyle. That is an extraordinary statement. Normally, under international law, when a body of water borders two states, a line equidistant from either side is drawn down the middle. That is international practice but it has not happened in the case of Lough Foyle. One suspects the reason is that the shipping channel would then be on the Inishowen side of the lough and there would be an issue for British security interests. That, I suspect, is why we have not sorted out this issue. It is why we have thousands of unregulated oyster trestles on Lough Foyle. People have a right to make a living from aquaculture and there is a place for that on Lough Foyle but it should be done in a managed, regulated way. However, that is left unresolved due to this failure. My difficulty with this legislation is that while the idea of pulling together various pieces of legislation and putting them under one roof makes sense, many unresolved and live issues remain. Sinn Féin has great difficulty with this legislation. We will submit substantial numbers of amendments when it comes before the Dáil on Committee Stage. We will argue for those amendments and we hope the Minister will listen to us. We hope he will be ambitious for Ireland and the State. We hope he will listen to the concerns of environmental groups and our fishing communities and take the opportunity to rectify the errors. I ask the Minister and the Government to give the following some thought. The Government argues that the 2013-14 agreement merely regularises the previous 1988 agreement and what preceded it, and agrees the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone of both states.The problem is that it was done in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy, and Brexit rules that agreement null and void. It is an act of bad faith which changes the context of the entire agreement and we have every right to withdraw from it. The Government should take the chance our amendments present and consider making a claim for Rockall. We should challenge the British claim to it and defend the interests of our fishing communities. God knows we have not taken enough opportunities to do that.	spk_159
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-06-15	dail	33	Pyrite and Mica Redress Issues: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_18	I move:“That Dáil Éireann:notes that:— during the Celtic Tiger building boom, light touch building regulation, poor oversight of construction products and reckless practice by some developers, builders and suppliers have left thousands of homeowners with significant building defects;— in Donegal, Mayo and Clare, thousands of homeowners continue to be affected by defective blocks containing mica and pyrite;— in June 2017, the Report of the Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks identified that thousands of homes in Donegal, and hundreds of homes in Mayo, were in need of remediation from mica and pyrite defective blocks;— in 2020, the Government introduced the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme, to be administered through Donegal and Mayo County Councils, providing 90 per cent of the costs of remediation;— during the course of 2021, it became clear to homeowners in Donegal and Mayo that the scheme was not fit for purpose and in many cases would only provide 70 per cent of the costs of remediation, or less; and— homeowners in Clare, and other counties affected by defective blocks, have yet to be included in this scheme; and agrees that:— homeowners, who purchased or built their homes in good faith, should not be liable for the costs of remediation caused by the incompetence, negligence or deliberate non-compliance of others;— the Government must immediately amend Statutory Instrument No. 25 of 2020, to provide those affected by defective blocks in Donegal, Mayo, Clare and other affected counties with 100 per cent redress, including remediation, storage and temporary accommodation costs; and— the Government must also ensure that those responsible for the manufacture of defective blocks are held to account, and that industry contributes to the overall cost of remediating defective properties.”The Minister will be aware that thousands of people from counties Donegal, Mayo, Clare and Sligo have come here to the centre of power and made their positions on this matter very clear. This motion follows the visit of Deputy McDonald to the affected families in Donegal just over a week ago. The families said they would be protesting on Tuesday, 15 June, when the Dáil returned after its recess. They asked the Deputy to put their case front and centre on that day, as Leader of the Opposition. That is how this motion came about. It reflects the demands of families in Donegal, Mayo, Clare and Sligo. The motion calls for 100% redress that is fully funded. That would provide equality between the families in Donegal and Mayo and families in Dublin and north Leinster. More than 2,000 families in Dublin and north Leinster have availed of the fully funded pyrite remediation scheme. It is right that the scheme was fully funded. I ask the Minister, in his comments today, not to make a comparison between the cost of the pyrite remediation scheme and the cost of the defective concrete block scheme. Such a comparison is utterly offensive to people. It is the equivalent of two people drowning, one of whom is told they will be saved because they are not too hard on the diesel for the helicopter while the other person, who is far out at sea, is told they will be left to drown because we cannot afford the diesel. That would be unheard of and I ask the Minister not to make those sorts of comparisons today. These people are in exactly the same situation. The people we represent did nothing wrong. They were victims of an era of light-touch regulation, self-regulation and no regulation during the Celtic tiger period, just like the families in Dublin and north Leinster. They are looking to be treated the same. That is our appeal to the Minister. I also note the proposed amendment to the motion that adds Sligo into the narrative, which is fine. There is also an amendment that refers to a public inquiry, which is also absolutely fine. We want to focus our motion on 100% redress but we welcome the additions from our colleagues in the House and we can support those amendments. I also understand the Government will not be opposing this motion, which is welcome news. There are people who are now heading home to Donegal, Mayo, Clare and other counties with hope in their hearts. We also hope they can get a good night's sleep for the first time in a long time. We were speaking to those families and many of them said it is a weight off their shoulders that the Government is signing up to a motion that calls for 100% redress. Let us be clear what is happening here. This is the democratically elected Parliament of the people and it will, it appears, this evening pass a motion calling clearly for 100% redress. I ask the Minister to urgently go about the process of implementing the desire and wishes of this Parliament, to work in partnership with the campaign groups to come to a 100% funded scheme to ensure that people will not be out huge amounts of money to make their homes safe. That is the call. I have repeatedly raised this issue with the Minister over the past year through parliamentary questions and in this forum. Our requests to review the scheme were repeatedly put back. We were told it was too early. I welcome the fact that in recent times the Minister has accepted that this scheme is utterly unfit for purpose. I welcome the fact that the Government has agreed not to oppose this motion and it accepts that the desire of our Parliament is for a 100% funded scheme. We ask the Minister to ensure the scheme is implemented urgently and as soon as possible in partnership with groups in Donegal and Mayo. We also ask that the families affected in Clare and Sligo are added to the scheme. Other families might also need to be added to the scheme. That is the challenge. We want to work with the Minister. The truth is that none of the public representatives in Donegal, no matter which political party they represent or who they are - they all know their neighbours - wanted this to happen and they all want to support their neighbours. I reach across and ask that we make this a fully funded scheme. Let us create equality between the east and west of Ireland. Let us work together to get this right, give people hope and show those young people who came out to the protest that when things are wrong, they can stand up, work with the political system and make change. It would give people faith and belief. That is my appeal to the Minister.	spk_171

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-06-02	dail	33	 National Recovery and Resilience Plan: Statements	dbsect_18	I want to continue where my colleague, Deputy Doherty, left off in terms of the mica scandal in Donegal. There will be families in Donegal and Mayo who are following this debate on the recovery and resilience fund and will have listened in recent days to Ministers talking about retrofitting and the need to build more houses who are questioning how on Earth they could have ended up with a scheme such as the defective concrete blocks grant scheme which, where a house is demolished, does not provide for windows to be replaced or the funding of energy efficient building practices, never mind that the work is not fully funded. The contribution in respect of a house that has to be demolished will not be 10%, it will be 30%. What does that mean in real terms? It means a contribution of over €100,000, a second mortgage. In the case of people who worked all of their lives and are in their later years, they have no chance of getting the matching funding to make their homes safe and so their homes are crumbling around them. I appeal to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to work with his Cabinet colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Taoiseach, all members of the Fianna Fáil Party, to do what is right by the people of Donegal and Mayo. This scheme, as is, will remain in place unless the Government amends it in the next number of days. Today, we are discussing a Government submission to the European Commission that talks about retrofitting, a carbon tax and standards.Yet, the Government is facilitating a scheme that does not help families to rebuild their homes to any of those standards. It expects them, for example, to use windows that may be 20 or 30 years old. It is an outrageous and offensive scheme. It is an insult to all the people in Donegal who worked politically with the Mica Action Group to deliver a scheme that would give people hope they could rebuild their lives. Homeowners thought they would get a scheme offering 90% cover, which was unjust in the first place, and the banks would play a role. Deputy Doherty and I have written repeatedly about this matter to the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank. I have raised the issue with the Minister in the Chamber. He said he did not know what I was talking about and he could not understand why the banks should play a role. These are the banks with assets that are worth nothing now but which will be restored to full market value. They were nowhere to be seen. It is time to move on now. Both the Government, with its scheme, and the banks have failed people in Donegal and Mayo. I take this opportunity, face to face with the Minister, to say to him that he needs to introduce a fully funded scheme, giving 100% cover, like the pyrite remediation scheme for the families in Dublin and north Leinster who, rightly, were given full security to rebuild their lives. That is what we are asking for and the decision on it will rest on the Minister's desk. I am asking him to sign off on it urgently.	spk_228

I left that meeting with a clear view that Irish Water is utterly under-resourced. There is clearly no plan in place to address how Irish Water meets its responsibilities to our communities across this State. In the case of south Inishowen, an inadequate pipe infrastructure that has burst repeatedly was put in place. This is the main trunk line from the Eddie Fullerton Dam to thousands of homes that are regularly impacted by water bursts. Those pipes were to be replaced a number of years ago. I was given a guarantee to that effect in a meeting with Irish Water but Irish Water is now saying that that will not be done any time soon because there are even worse cases across the county. What a mess. Letterkenny town is the major gateway and magnet for investment in the county. Irish Water is now stating that the situation there will have to be developer-led. That is a mess that has impacted Letterkenny in the past. The infrastructure needs to be put in place and building can then occur around it. There are concerns over both water and wastewater. Councillors in Letterkenny have a vision to extend the town southward. That is their vision. They want to develop lands for wastewater and water but Irish Water cannot do it. There is a whole area, as one approaches the town from the direction of Buncrana and Derry, containing businesses and houses that are not connected to a state-of-the-art sewerage treatment plant because the investment is not there. I give the Minister of State those examples of the mess we are facing and the need for a plan and resourcing. That is why this motion is so important.	spk_37

Human Rights Watch recently published a report comprehensively demonstrating that Israel is an apartheid state, and this follows the report from the respected human rights organisation, B'Tselem. Our Government knows this. That is the context to the slaughter that is happening right now, in which 181 Palestinians have been killed, with 1,200 injuries and 34,000 people displaced. Forty schools operated by the UN are now being used as shelters, and 18 high-rise towers have been destroyed, along with 350 buildings.

There was a huge housing boom and self-regulation was the order of the day. In the case of pyrite, the State stepped up and put in place the pyrite remediate scheme, which is fully funded, which is as it should be. In counties Donegal and Mayo, however, the families have been asked to step up and make 10% available and the banks were supposed to help. That was second-class citizenship but it has got even worse a year on. Now people have to pay as much as 50% of the cost of making their homes safe. What we are demanding in Donegal is equal citizenship.

Human Rights Watch recently published a report comprehensively demonstrating that Israel is an apartheid state, and this follows the report from the respected human rights organisation, B'Tselem. Our Government knows this. That is the context to the slaughter that is happening right now, in which 181 Palestinians have been killed, with 1,200 injuries and 34,000 people displaced. Forty schools operated by the UN are now being used as shelters, and 18 high-rise towers have been destroyed, along with 350 buildings. When is the Government going to return to the leadership that we showed in the 1980s? When are our people going to have a Government that will do what is right in what we feel about this crisis?	spk_203

Rather than implement the will of the Dáil and Seanad, the then-Government introduced a scoping exercise led by Judge Haughton. That was to have been completed by May 2020, then September, then December, then this March and then this April. I am sure the Taoiseach will appreciate that the delay is causing ongoing distress to Shane's family. It has been protracted and it is unjustifiable at this stage. Will the Taoiseach assure the family that it will be completed as soon as possible and a decision on a public inquiry will not be delayed any further after that?	spk_207

There was a huge housing boom and self-regulation was the order of the day. In the case of pyrite, the State stepped up and put in place the pyrite remediate scheme, which is fully funded, which is as it should be. In counties Donegal and Mayo, however, the families have been asked to step up and make 10% available and the banks were supposed to help. That was second-class citizenship but it has got even worse a year on. Now people have to pay as much as 50% of the cost of making their homes safe. What we are demanding in Donegal is equal citizenship. Our people whose lives have been devastated are asking for a fully funded redress scheme that is the same as that for the families in Dublin and north Leinster.

The cost to our fishing industry every year is at least €43 million. This is a 15% loss. In areas such as mackerel and prawn, which are crucial to particular ports and harbours, the impact is huge. The reason people are so angry is not only what has happened in the trade agreement. It has historical context. As we speak, Ireland's waters account for 12% of overall European Union waters yet in terms of fish we catch 4%. We get one-third in proportionate terms. This is nowhere near a fair share of the fish in European Union waters. What is the impact of this? It is that every year tens of thousands of jobs are lost in our seafood sector. It is estimated that the loss to our economy is €600 million per year because we do not get a fair share of the fish in our waters or overall European Union waters. This is the context that has led to an even bigger injustice now, whereby we are taking a proportionately much bigger hit from the deal. This is absolutely outrageous and unacceptable. What I hear from the Minister with responsibility for the marine, Deputy McConalogue, and from the Taoiseach today, is that we should be grateful that we were not entirely blocked from getting access to UK waters. They are missing the point. The historical context is that we have never got a fair share of the fish in our own waters. This is not about sustainability. This is about us getting a fair share. This was costing us tens of thousands of jobs every year and €600 million before the trade deal and now it is even worse. That is why people are so angry. I also want to put on the record the issue of bluefin tuna. Bluefin tuna is one of the most lucrative fish in the world. It is in abundance at present in our waters. In the past four years, there has been a 73% increase, or 8,000 additional tonnes, for the European Union fishing fleet. However, not one fish or one pound of that increase was given to the Irish fleet, even though the species is in abundance in our waters. Right now, our fishermen can only catch and release bluefin tuna but huge volumes are caught in our waters by foreign fleets. This practice is being allowed to continue. I put to the Minister of State the cumulative injustice and the example of bluefin tuna. Our fishing communities are being treated with absolute and utter contempt. I urge the Minister of State to up the game of the Government and put all of these facts on the table with our European partners and demand fair play and justice for our coastal communities.	spk_230

In the past 11 years, it was 543 council houses. Therefore, in 11 years, in Donegal, 543 were either built or acquired, although in 2002, in one year, more were built or acquired. That is the scale of the intentional failure of public housing in our county. What has that led to? As I speak today, more than 2,300 families are renting in the private sector in Donegal under the housing assistance payment or the rental accommodation scheme. This means that other families are struggling to find private rental accommodation and, if they are able to find it, they are paying way more than they would expect in the economy in Donegal. What I am painting is a picture of intentionally designed failure on public housing. I appeal to the Minister in his wrap-up speech today to address what will be done in my county of Donegal – I am sure every other Deputy can give similar examples - to address this serious failure that impacts so profoundly and creates the difficulties that are being dealt with in this legislation.

We are all in this together. We really desperately want this to succeed. Therefore, the Minister should take my comments in the time ahead constructively. When I saw the list of vaccination centres across the country, I saw one vaccination centre in Letterkenny, and the Minister knows the geography of Donegal. We then learned there would be two vaccination centres in Kerry, which has a similar population, in Tipperary, in Westmeath and in the Minister's own county of Wicklow, and five in Cork. When I questioned this, I was told that GPs and pharmacists will be delivering this. Why is just one vaccination centre in Letterkenny enough for the entire county of Donegal when there are two or five in other counties? That is the first issue. The next issue is that I am told the GPs will be delivering this. The GPs in Carndonagh, a town on the Inishowen peninsula which I represent, were without the vaccine to deliver to their patients in recent days. We understand the vaccine is on the way soon, but it has caused great distress. I got a telephone call today from an 89 year old woman. Her vaccination was booked and then cancelled. She does not know when it will happen. GPs are speaking out across the State. As we speak, there is a real problem with the logistics, whatever about the supply issues. Will the Minister reassure the people of Donegal? The Minister will appreciate that people are looking across the nearby Border, which is obviously under the different regulatory system of the UK, and seeing that the North might open months ahead of society in Donegal.

It is the culmination of many years of campaigning by families, similar to the campaigns in Dublin and north Leinster, that led to the pyrite resolution scheme. Unfortunately, the scheme in Donegal is turning into a big problem. There was a necessity for 10% funding for the costs of engineering and construction, but families are finding out that the cost of demolition and reconstruction of their homes is way beyond the maximum grant available. The cost of replacing the outer leaf at the lower end of affected walls is already way above the maximum grant available. Families who have waited all these years for some hope of making their homes safe have been left in a desperate situation, through no fault of their own. It is the result of a failure in standards and oversight by the State in the construction of concrete blocks. Hardly a day goes by that I do not speak to families about their despair. I am calling on the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to carry out an urgent review of this scheme based on the applications already submitted to Donegal County Council and the Department. There is a widespread belief in Donegal that the scheme is not fit for purpose as currently designed. I say that for the information of the Minister, but I wish to raise with him another matter. Deputy Doherty and I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, asking where the banks were in all of this. The banks are having their assets all across Donegal reinstated from site valuation to full market value. Their assets will be enhanced by tens of millions of euro if not hundreds of millions of euro. I am not aware of a single bank that has stepped up to provide financial assistance to the families. Will the Minister for Finance and Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage urgently convene a forum of the banks and financial institutions to demand that they make a real contribution, along with the affected families and the State, to the challenge of making these homes safe? 	spk_283

It is unacceptable that, for the third week out of four, there will not be dedicated statements and questions to the Minister for Health on the public health response and the vaccination programme. Those statements and questions were agreed by the Business Committee and understood to take place every three weeks out of four. I understand that additional hours will be allocated to Dáil sittings from next week. The Government needs to clarify for the record that there will be additional hours, more time for the Opposition and fixed statements with the Minister for Health for the duration of the crisis as a standing time slot every week on the public health response and the vaccination programme.

This is now the sixth week where the Dáil is sitting for half its usual hours. Normally the Dáil sits 33 or 34 hours a week, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, and we are sitting for half that time. That means we have no Taoiseach's questions, no Ministers' questions and instead of three Private Members' slots for dealing with legislation we have one. Topical issues, Questions on Promised Legislation and Leaders' Questions have been reduced. This is intolerable for the Opposition and intolerable that this continues. To add insult to injury, for the second time in three weeks we have no opportunity for statements and questions to the Minister for Health on the public health response and the vaccine roll-out, which is the very reason we are reduced to half our normal time. It is intolerable and this has to change. The Government will produce a schedule to the Business Committee tomorrow. According to the report of the Business Committee, the Opposition has registered its dissent for the third week in a row.The Government is not listening to the Opposition.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-02-17	dail	33	Covid-19 (Agriculture, Food and the Marine): Statements	dbsect_14	I raise two very important issues with the Minister under the fisheries heading. First, as the Minister is aware, the tie-up scheme last year was seen right across the fishing sector as too little too late and there was a very low take-up. The affected fishers right across the coast did not get the financial assistance they required. The Minister introduced an aquaculture support scheme. Will he revisit the whole issue this year, particularly in respect of the inshore fishermen, who have had a huge hit on the markets, as the Minister will know well from Donegal, and have been really struggling financially? Outside of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, they have not received the support that they need. Will the Minister revisit the financial supports for the inshore and the offshore fishing sectors and will he amend the Covid-19 aquaculture scheme? I am aware that the Minister has been engaging with the IFA aquaculture section on this issue. Will he amend and strengthen that scheme? I am aware, for example, of fishers in Donegal who because they are only starting their sales in 2020 missed out on availing of that scheme. This is a critical support and I ask that the Minister would revise that scheme in terms of the financial supports? I also must raise with the Minister the reports carried in  As to the issues in Killybegs, I am aware, and it seems very reasonable to me, that whenever a catch is weighed, the water would be deducted. The water is essential for the sustenance of the fish to keep them fresh, to get them into the factories, and to be able to export them. This is an industry that people have worked so hard to build. My understanding is, and it is very reasonable, that there needs to be a removal of the water weight that is essential for the protection of the fish and to weigh it accurately. They have devised a system there, which is of a National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, approved standard. I am appealing to the Minister to intervene to ensure that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, reaches an agreement with the fishing industry there. To summarise my question on this point, will the Minister appeal this decision, if it is a decision of the European Commission, to ensure there is no reduction in quota? Will he defend the arguments the fishing community are making in Killybegs around this issue? We cannot tolerate this as we need additional, not less, quota and I ask the Minister to intervene urgently.	spk_169
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-02-11	dail	33	Dumping at Sea Act 1996 (Section 5(12)) (Commencement) Order 2021: Motion	dbsect_10	I welcome the opportunity to address this motion. I offer Sinn Féin's support for the measure, but with conditionality. The powers that will be afforded to the Ministers following the agreement of the motion are complementary to the marine planning and development Bill on which the Department is currently working, which will have far-reaching consequences and leave a long-term impact on coastal communities and the fishing industry. I accept there needs to be strict oversight and scrutiny of any application to dump materials at sea by the Ministers and their successors. Dumping at sea should only take place as a last resort and where no other alternative is available. Under no circumstances should any toxic materials ever be dumped at sea to cause harm to the marine environment. Marine planning is essential to ensure a viable and sustainable future for all on the island who use and, in some cases, depend on the marine environment for their livelihood. I wish to raise an area of real concern with the marine planning and development Bill. The functions of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are excluded from the scope of the Bill. It appears that aquaculture licensing is not included in the Bill, which is a major problem. For years, the potential of the aquaculture industry to create thousands of jobs in remote coastal communities, including in my constituency of Donegal, has been blocked and stymied by shocking levels of bureaucracy and under-resourcing of the application and appeals process. Some aquaculture licence applications have dragged on for more than ten years. The company, Mowi Ireland, previously Marine Harvest, is a world leader in aquaculture. It is based in the Fanad Peninsula in north Donegal. It has been held back for years from creating many more jobs and wealth in Donegal and on the west coast. Norway, Scotland and even the Faroe Islands produce multiples of the annual production in Ireland. This shocking failure has cost us thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions in lost revenue. The report of the 2017 independent review of the aquaculture licensing process was supposed to change all of that, but the recommendations have not yet been fully implemented. That must be urgently addressed. One of the key areas of change is the separation of the aquaculture licensing function from the monitoring and enforcement of aquaculture licences. I appeal to the Minister to take aquaculture licensing under the scope of the Bill and away from the failed model under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. One other very important issue that will affect the future of fishers and coastal communities is marine protected areas. I took on the role of Sinn Féin spokesperson on fisheries and the marine last summer. Since then, I have engaged extensively with fishers and their representatives. Irish fishers are extremely concerned and angry with the Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. For a long time, they have seen themselves as a forgotten industry. They have been sacrificed at every turn in EU negotiations to get a better deal for other sectors. Not alone have they faced Covid-19, but they also face Brexit. Without doubt, fisheries has been the industry most damaged and the one that has faced most disruption since the Brexit trade deal at the turn of the year.There have been reductions in quotas, displacement of vessels, difficulties landing in ports, significant reductions in prices of some species and the collapse of export prices. I raise these issues because the next significant issue coming down the tracks is marine protected areas. These are the responsibility of the Minister and his Department. In every meeting that I have held with fishery representatives, marine protected areas, MPAs, are raised. Our fishers are the custodians of the sea. They need sustainable stock to preserve their traditions and livelihoods. I stress that they are not against marine protected areas. They want to be included. They need to be engaged with and they must be part of the decision-making process. I have read the Department's report, Expanding Ireland's Marine Protected Area Network. While it is welcome, the report is entirely academic and science-based. There is no engagement with fishers and this is unacceptable. Ireland does not currently have legislation governing MPAs. This is an opportunity to allow engagement to take place. There need to be widespread consultations with the fishing sector to agree the best approach for marine protected areas in Ireland. There have been positive experiences with fishers in Galicia and the Canary Islands when introducing MPAs. I ask that we ensure the same happens in Ireland. Sinn Féin wants a robust and transparent marine planning system that supports our coastal communities, protects the marine environment and facilitates timely development of offshore energy sources. All three of these objectives can be achieved with the right level of planning and the right policy framework. It is the Minister's job to get all of these right. We have real concerns that the draft general scheme of the marine planning and development Bill is weak on ensuring full consultation with all representative and stakeholder bodies in coastal and other communities. We need to ensure the protection of the marine environment and a community dividend for communities where offshore wind projects are planned and will eventually be located. We must ensure maximum access and passage are preserved for our fishing fleet, especially our smaller inshore fleet, and that fishers' livelihoods are protected. We must study and request further studies of international best practice regarding where offshore wind farms are currently located and that a maximum distance from shore is ensured where possible. We can get this right. Ireland can be a benchmark for other countries. Planning, which is included in the Title of the Bill, is paramount. Protecting our marine area and ensuring a sustainable environment for our coastal communities and the country generally are paramount. We believe that sustainable economic fisheries, aquaculture, marine protected areas and offshore wind energy farms can all coexist but they can only coexist with meticulous and inclusive planning. Change can be good. It can create opportunities and it is needed to secure our future and address our climate change requirements. We in Sinn Féin will continue to engage with coastal communities, environmental NGOs, scientific experts and industry to advance our three objectives of protecting and sustaining our marine environment, supporting the sustainable development of our coastal communities and facilitating the delivery of renewable energy through offshore wind farms. I reaffirm the absolute necessity of ensuring that the aquaculture licensing process comes under this legislation. How can we have marine planning if we do not include aquaculture licensing? People have a right to see the advertisement, to know the location and to be properly aware of it. They have a right to object and submit environmental considerations. That decision should be made in a timely fashion. One cannot develop an aquaculture industry if one does not know if one will have a licence and might be stuck for ten years. I reaffirm the point and I appreciate that the Minister responded in the positive. It is important that we take this opportunity to introduce a marine planning framework to correct the mistakes that we made, allow people to have their say and protect that right, while, at the same time, allowing the industry to grow and achieve the substantial potential we have seen achieved in countries such as Scotland, Norway and even the Faroe Islands, which have multiples of what we have. I wish the Minister well in those endeavours and I am willing to work with him to achieve that goal.	spk_229

Both organisations have provided a tremendous service to children and young people with disabilities and their families for about 20 years. For 18 years, they did not have any fixed financial support from the State. There was a campaign in Donegal to change that, and two years ago they were allocated €36,000 per annum. That equates to one quarter of the real needs identified by the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation and about one third of the needs of iCARE. Their representatives met Ministers with responsibility for health and disabilities in the previous Government. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for meeting them last year and I understand she is trying to resolve the issue. The issue is urgent. The Minister will be aware that during the pandemic, the usual supports from the statutory services have not been there. iCARE and the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation are assuming the burden. I think we will all agree it was harrowing to read the recent correspondence. I urge the Minister and the Minister of State to ensure that the services get the necessary funding.

The Minister will be aware that our fishing industry acted in good faith, working with other member states' fishing representatives, and they were shafted here. The burden that the Irish fishing industry is being asked to take is shocking. They do not want financial compensation. They want to fish the abundance of fish in the waters around our country. The Government voted down an amendment from Sinn Féin yesterday that mandated the Minister to go back and renegotiate the Common Fisheries Policy to ensure that the Irish fishing industry gets a fair share of the fish in its waters.

I join with the Minister in paying my condolences to the family and friends of Hugo Boyle. He was a Donegal man but he was very important to fishers throughout the island, particularly in the south and west where he was the chief executive of the producer organisation. I have seen some very moving tributes to him and I join the Minister in paying tribute to him. With regard to the issue of licences, I appreciate that the Minister listened to the concerns of fishers and has taken steps in the right direction in designating more ports but the difficulty is that the European Commission notified the Department last year, which gave it plenty of time that there was an issue with designation. The Northern Ireland Fish Producers Organisation, NIFPO, corresponded with the Department and asked about this issue. There was plenty of notice that there was going to be a problem. Right now, there are still affected fishers. For example, Dunmore East will need to be designated. There is a substantial fishery. It is the closest to some of the waters off the UK. Numerous vessels with UK licences land there every year and it would have a real impact. Due to the ill-health of Hugo Boyle, I assume, this issue may not have been raised as forcefully as it would had his health been with him. That may have been an oversight but I ask the Minister to address it. Piers such as Malin Head, Ballywhoriskey and Magheroarty in Donegal should be added. I am also disappointed that Sea Fisheries Protection Authority officers seems to have controlled the time window available, which is Monday to Friday. We cannot ask fishers to fish a five-day week. They fish depending on weather conditions. There could be tremendous weather on a Saturday or Sunday when they are forced to go out and fish. There needs to be a review of these time windows. We need to respect that the industry has to work with the weather. We do not know what the weather will be on any day of the week so it is unreasonable to limit people to Monday to Friday. I say all of this while giving the Minister considerable credit for fighting the case and sending a message to fishers that somebody was willing to challenge those in authority in the Department. Credit is given to the Minister for his effort but more needs to be done and I ask him to review this and take representations from fishers.	spk_278

Worse than that, it is going to co-operatives and producers and getting rid of their lobsters and crabs. It is an appalling situation.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	48	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2021-01-13	dail	33	Covid 19 (Health): Statements	dbsect_12	I want to raise the concerns in Donegal about its major acute hospital, Letterkenny University Hospital. The Minister will be well aware that in recent days, approximately 170 staff were off work at the hospital for a variety of Covid-19-related reasons. Seven ambulances were backed up outside the hospital. That meant that half the capacity in the county was tied up, which caused great alarm. What assurances can the Minister give that additional resources can be deployed to Letterkenny University Hospital? What proactive efforts is the Minister making to appeal to those who may have retired as healthcare workers in Donegal to come and assist? I understand there is additional capacity at St. Joseph's Community Hospital, Stranorlar. Can that capacity be utilised? At present, there are more than 100 patients with Covid-19-related issues in the hospital. I will take this opportunity to convey my utmost solidarity with front-line healthcare workers across the State who have done incredible work throughout this crisis, particularly in recent weeks. However, they need assurances that everything possible is being done to assist them in the incredible pressure they are under. The other issue is the vaccinations. As the Minister knows, up until recent weeks Donegal had the highest numbers per 100,000 in the entire State. They were stubbornly high numbers and the hospital staff were carrying that responsibility. We would have expected that they would have been top of the list for vaccination but they were behind by a week and we are still getting reports from front-line nurses in the hospital that they have not received the vaccination. My questions are around vaccinations for the staff in Letterkenny University Hospital, getting extra staff into the hospital and the issue of extra capacity being available at St. Joseph's Community Hospital in Stranorlar.	spk_194

Today at short notice we have been advised that the debates relating to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement that were scheduled have been pulled back. That has been welcomed by all members of the Opposition. It has saved two hours from the schedule today on the Government side and that is fine.

I propose that we now schedule a sitting for Friday and allow more time. The proposal for Thursday's business allocates 145 minutes each to Brexit and the Covid-19 task force. Instead, there should be two 220-minute debates, with time set aside for questions, and that business should be taken on Friday. The Government is packing everything into Thursday night. The Dáil is currently scheduled to sit until midnight on Thursday, but it will probably go on until 1 a.m. I suggest to the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip that the wise thing to do would be to take both sets of statements on Friday with a bit more time allocated to them and provision for questions and answers such that we can wrap up properly for the Christmas period having done our job effectively.	spk_68

It is, in fact, healthy for a democracy that voters have a clear choice when they go to the polls. Sinn Féin will always prioritise State investment in public services and providing income supports, housing, education and jobs where needed. We promote a bottom-up and public collective approach. The approach of the Minister and Fine Gael is different. They support a top-down wealth creation model. That is okay too in a democracy. Of course, we know this model excludes people. It does not afford equal opportunity. We in Sinn Féin will never support or promote such an approach. I will not stand here this evening and criticise the measures the Minister is proposing to legislate for in the Bill. In fact, we welcome them. They represent social progress as they provide more means to those who have least. I welcome the measures and so does my party. I particularly support the pension measure. The increase in the pension age to 67 became a huge issue in the 2020 general election and rightly so. We in Sinn Féin advocated and supported a return to the State retirement age, with the choice of individuals, to the age of 65. We welcome the move to 66, albeit that it was done kicking and screaming, but we hope the Minister will go further with further public pressure and bring it back to 65. I wish to speak specifically on the social protection measures available to the Irish fishing community.I believe we need to do something radically different when it comes to social protection and fishers. I encourage the Minister to commission a piece of work on how we treat fishers with regard to income supports. While the Department administers payments universally, and this is generally the right approach, we have to recognise the uniqueness of the work of Irish fishers and their vital importance to the Irish economy and food chain. Covid has exposed the deficiencies. Overnight, the Irish fishing industry was turned upside down. The export market was wiped out, there was no domestic market to replace it and fishers were left scrambling to find income. While the PUP was eventually opened up to the fishing community, and this was welcomed, it did not recognise the uniqueness of the nature of fishing, which is dependent on weather conditions and the time of year in regard to fish stocks. The lifting of restrictions is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment but it is also relevant in this regard. Fishers could not access temporary wage subsidy supports because most are on self-employed contracts, they could not access working capital loans as there was existing debt with financial institutions and they were locked out of restart grants from local authorities because they do not pay rates. The tie-up scheme from Europe to cover weather events was totally inadequate, too late and ill-thought-out. With Brexit, and the ever-increasing threat of a no-deal Brexit, I am appealing to the Minister to do something different. The Irish fishing community is on its knees and needs support. We need new thinking. I appeal to the Minister to engage with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to put together a task force involving fishing representatives, and to look at introducing targeted, specific measures that the fishing community can access when crisis hits. As I said at the outset, the fishing community needs support. If it is going to survive into the future, and as a people we need it to do so, then radical action must be taken. I implore the Minister to do so and I am happy to work with her to develop supporting measures. In particular, I am thinking of the inshore fleet, which is reliant on lobster and crab fishing and the like and is very limited in its access to traditional fisheries like herring. It is very important that the Minister engages with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, to look at some novel approach, working with the fishing representative organisations, to give supports to keep our fishermen delivering this resource to coastal communities and, of course, this food resource to the Irish people.	spk_218

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	47	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2020-12-02	dail	33	Pre-European Council: Statements	dbsect_11	I raised the threats to our fishing sector from Brexit with the Minister of State in previous debates. There is growing concern and alarm in our fishing communities at the news that Michel Barnier is offering 15% to 18% of a reduction in value in terms of access to what are deemed to be British waters. Under the Common Fisheries Policy our territorial waters and British territorial waters outside the 12-mile limit are divided for all member states of the European Union, based on a total allowable catch quota system. That offer was rejected, and there was serious concern about the offer. It is time for us to state clearly to our European Union counterparts that what is emerging here, whether it is Britain accepting the 18% offer or much worse, requires a renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy. There is major concern. Approximately 400 European vessels that fish in British territorial waters are affected by this. They need a home to go to. An important statistic is that 34% of the entire catch taken by the Irish fleet is caught in what the UK terms British territorial waters. That is the serious level of threat we face. It is existential for a number of ports and long-standing fishing communities. We must be straight with our European Union counterparts that this will require an urgent renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine yesterday and gave a presentation. His senior officials would have assisted with drafting it. The presentation was clear that the annual negotiations that take place in December on the total allowable catch and sustainable fisheries are up in the air due to Brexit, so we must be ready to renegotiate the Common Fisheries Policy. We must urgently protect the national interest and the interests of our fishing communities. There is massive anger already that we have given away so much of the immense resource in our waters. That has been sacrificed and we cannot allow any more to be given. There can be no further erosion of our waters and we must regain what we will have lost in these negotiations through increased quotas in our waters. The message I wish to convey urgently to the Minister of State and the Government before these negotiations is that they must defend the national interest and our fishing communities and make it absolutely clear that we are not pawns in this game or pieces to be offered up in negotiations. We must not come out of this by destroying our fishing communities.	spk_154

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	47	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2020-11-18	dail	33	Rural and Community Development: Statements	dbsect_21	Covid-19 has affected every single walk of life since last March. When society practically shut down eight months ago, we entered the land of the unknown. Natural human interaction that we took for granted was no longer possible. We needed to try to find a new way of interacting. It was no longer possible to attend workplaces or school settings. At some stages, we could no longer fly, drive or even walk to meet our families. The possibility of attending sporting or music events was removed. This was all due to the threat of the virus. Technology stepped into the breach, and thankfully so. I doubt many or any of us just those few months ago had ever heard of Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts or other similar virtual forums. What I am getting to is that whenever our basis of humanity was removed or threatened by this global pandemic, the only mechanism that allowed us to continue our lives with some sense of normality was technology. However, the issue is that if ever the technological divide in Ireland manifested itself and showed how wrong and problematic this divide is, it was during this Covid-19 crisis. A year ago almost to the day, on 19 November 2019 my constituency colleague and then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, announced a €128 million broadband investment that would connect 32,000 homes and businesses in Donegal to a high-speed fibre optic broadband network. Many people would have loved to have had such a connection in recent months. I wish to touch on my county's experience with the Eir contract under which the company was contracted to reach out to another 300,000 homes. Lines were drawn in rural communities outside of towns. These were cruel lines. I have lost count of the number of families my office has dealt with that were just outside the lines. They were looking at their neighbours who gained this absolutely essential access to broadband. It is almost comparable to the electrification of the country back in the day it is so vital in the modern age. Those families were looking at other houses not too far away from them that had gained access, but they had not. That was so cruel. We must deliver this plan. The House is only too well aware of the problems successive Governments have had in rolling out a national broadband plan. Indeed, we in Sinn Féin had our concerns about the current national broadband plan and we put them forward at the time. That said, we are where we are. The irony of Covid-19 is that although technology went some way to eradicating some of the problems the virus threw at us, the virus also inhibited and affected the roll-out of the current broadband plan. It is now behind schedule. We are at a point where it must be taken as a matter of the utmost seriousness and a priority for the Government. Rural Ireland can no longer operate without a connected broadband infrastructure. For far too long, rural Ireland has been operating with one hand held behind its back when it comes to broadband and, dare I say, there has been no spark from far too many Governments when it came to levelling the pitch. I can tell the Minister that it is unacceptable and will not be accepted for any considerable period into the future. It is my belief that the success or failure of the roll-out of the national broadband plan will be a litmus test for the Government. Life has changed as a result of Covid-19. Patients are accessing medical appointments through a laptop or mobile phone screen. Students in school or college are doing their lessons online. Increased numbers of people are doing their shopping online and banking is carried out almost exclusively online. None of these necessary life actions can happen without quick, secure and affordable access to broadband. I ask the Minister to convene an implementation team within her Department, if such a team is not already in place, to work directly with National Broadband Ireland to get the roll-out of broadband back on track, to speed it up if possible and to allow my constituency of Donegal and all other parts of rural Ireland at least to have an even hand when we are fighting for jobs, investment and tourism. To finish as I started, rural and community development is impossible into the future without access to broadband. I urge the Minister to let this be her legacy in the Department for which she has responsibility.	spk_198

I have received official notification from the Oireachtas authorities that this cannot now go ahead. Intentionally, the Government's confidence motion is aimed at tripling its speaking time, from 20 minutes to 63 minutes, and halving the Opposition's speaking time, from 100 minutes to 50 minutes. It triples the Government's speaking time and halves the Opposition's speaking time. That is the intent of the Government motion. The House will not sit until 1 a.m. but will wrap up at approximately 11 p.m. I want to make an official protest about that move.	spk_9

Yesterday, the Government circulated a proposal that each party and group in the Opposition would have ten minutes to question the Tánaiste about matters of profound importance. As was seen on Leaders' Questions, there was a range of questions that the Taoiseach could not answer, but which he says the Tánaiste will answer later. However, he has only allocated ten minutes. I ask the Taoiseach again to make more time available. Yesterday, an email was sent to the Chief Whip with a proposal from Sinn Féin for extra time to be allocated to all Opposition parties and groups for what is an important matter in the interests of the people. I understand all the Opposition groups have supported that proposal, so I await the Taoiseach's response to it. I expect him to allocate more time for this important debate later.	spk_55

Their presentations were stark but one of the game-changers was the map I am holding, which clearly defines the exclusive economic zones. Essentially, what is marked in red on the map are British fishing waters or British territory as they would see it which, like our own exclusive economic zone, are subject to the Common Fisheries Policy.The warning signs were clear when Britain withdrew from the London Fisheries Convention a number of years ago on the grounds that its waters were to be used as a negotiating tactic in the trade negotiations. The convention was signed in 1964. After 1973, when the UK joined the EU, it secured a 26% increase in the allocation under what is called ""relative stability"" to reflect the development of the exclusive economic zones in 1976. It was an increase of 26% above that of, and taken from, everybody else. The Hague Preferences must also be considered in this regard. There have been a number of initiatives to deal with UK concerns over the years under the Common Fisheries Policy. There is great concern. No sector is more threatened by the negotiations than fisheries. It is important that our Government works closely with other European governments. There are encouraging signs that this is happening. Access to British territorial fishing waters is built into the trade negotiations and is seen to be necessary if the desired goal is to be achieved but the Government should be cognisant of the serious concerns of the producer organisations and aware of the European Fisheries Alliance that represents 18,000 fishermen and 3,500 vessels from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Sweden. The annual turnover of the sector is €20.7 billion. Its representatives have come together to collectively ask the governments to hold their ground and defend the interests of our fishing communities. If the British do not negotiate a fair deal, we will need to re-examine the Common Fisheries Policy. A total of 38% of the catch of the Irish fleet is taken from British waters. If this is lost, we will need to revisit the policy. I hope it will not come to that. I appeal to our Government to do everything it can to hold the line for our fishing communities."	spk_260

It is our major acute hospital, the sixth largest in the State. It dealt with more than 24,000 inpatients last year. One would not know it, however. I will talk about that in a moment. I want to use the example of our major acute hospital to demonstrate the utter failure of Governments over the past decade to invest adequately in our health services and how that utter failure has led us to be uniquely exposed to this pandemic. We have the lowest number of ICU beds  Letterkenny University Hospital dealt with 24,000 inpatients last year. It is the sixth largest hospital in the State. If one looks at a list of the top 15 hospitals in terms of annual budgets, one will see that Letterkenny comes 13th. On a list of the top 15 hospitals ranked by budget allocated per inpatient, Letterkenny is again 13th in the State. On a list of the top 15 ranked by number of consultants, Letterkenny is 14th. It is 12th in the State with regard to numbers of nurses and midwives. It is clear that we have been neglected and discriminated against but it goes further than that. If one looks at the most recent waiting lists for outpatient and inpatient treatment available from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, one will see that we now have 21,789 people on these lists. The population of Donegal is 160,000. This means that more than one in eight of our men, women and children is on a hospital waiting list. Some 5,000 of these people have been waiting longer than 18 months for their hospital appointment. It is an absolute scandal. One might say this is a result of the Covid crisis but let us look at the figures from 27 February, just before this crisis kicked in. The total number waiting for outpatient treatment at that stage was 17,751 and the number waiting for inpatient treatment was more than 2,000. More than 19,000 people were on the waiting lists before this crisis. In the hospital in Letterkenny, an average of 19 people were on trolleys every single day because it was at 100% of its capacity. That is the reality of the health service and the neglect of my county's major acute hospital. That is why we are uniquely exposed to this pandemic and why this budget is such a profound disappointment with regard to the number of ICU beds and other beds to be delivered next year in real terms. The number is nowhere big enough to respond adequately. The lessons that should have been learned from this crisis have not been learned.	spk_181

Such a family typically has a car that is six, seven or eight years old. Those living in Donegal who wish to travel to a job or a place of study cannot do so by public transport. As such, they must drive a car and fill it with diesel or petrol. The average family in such areas cannot afford an electric car. God forbid. It is just out of reach. Even if they could afford such a car, it would not be practical because of the infrastructure in Donegal. The Government is penalising people who do not have an alternative. Many people whose homes are heated by oil, coal or turf do not have the money to retrofit their homes, such as by installing solar panels. In this case, the Government is again penalising people who do not have an alternative. The objective the Government wishes to achieve is not affordable, so it is penalising people who cannot afford it. The people who will benefit from the increase are the wealthier in society. This is an ill-thought out and lazy policy. The Government could go after the heavy polluters in society but it is not doing so in an effective way. Any representative of rural Ireland worth their salt who looks at the full spectrum of options available to people in rural Ireland must oppose this proposition. It is a no-brainer for a representative of rural Ireland to oppose this financial resolution.	spk_50

That is welcome but NPHET must also be accountable and must engage with public representatives on very serious developments. We need clarification on these matters.	spk_22

No. 318 of 2020): Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_29	"I move:That Dáil Éireann resolves that the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 318 of 2020) be and are hereby annulled.On behalf of all the fishing organisations Sinn Féin has spoken to, we support a penalty points system being put in place - it is essential - but the system must be fair and just. It is important that I outline the history of how we got here this evening. Previous statutory instruments introduced by Ministers in the Department with responsibility for the marine were ruled illegal by the High Court on a number of occasions. The issue went to the Supreme Court and the challenges by the fishermen were upheld. Subsequently, SI 89 of 2018 was put in place by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, who signed it. In May 2018 the Dáil came to debate an annulment motion, just like this one, and for the first time in the history of the State, the Dáil voted to annul a statutory instrument. It was immensely significant, it had never happened before and has not happened since. I will quote from some of the debate. The proposer of the motion, who deserves great credit, was the former Donegal Deputy, Pat the Cope Gallagher, who had been Fianna Fáil's spokesperson on fisheries and marine. He said:The statutory instrument states that the determination panel and the appeals officer if such is the case would determine on the balance of probabilities. We do not accept this principle of a lesser burden of proof. It is grossly unfair to the individual to lower the burden of proof. We will be proposing a statutory instrument we have prepared under which, in both instances, the case must be proven by the State beyond a reasonable doubt in line with common law principles. Hear, hear. He continued: To put it in simple language, the proposed structure under this statutory instrument would be similar to An Garda Síochána detecting an infringement, being allowed to select the judges to adjudicate on the case and finally handing down the eventual judgment.I will now quote the current Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, during the same debate on 23 May 2018:We need to take on board the needs of the fishing sector. We need to avoid the possibility of it being struck down in the courts again. The Department's track record in introducing a penalty-points regime has been poor. Given that on two occasions attempted statutory instruments were struck down following appeals to the Supreme Court reflects very poorly on the management of the issue heretofore.Later, he said:The key points that remain to be addressed relate to the burden of proof. The current approach in the statutory instrument deals with the balance of probability rather than having to prove beyond doubt, which is normally the case where a criminal sanction is being pursued. The role of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, permeates the statutory instrument at all stages, which was the basis on which the Supreme Court struck down the previous statutory instruments.We can see the concerns expressed by the Fianna Fáil spokespersons. Deputy Dara Calleary, the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, expressed his concerns about the ""burden of proof, the rights of appeal, penalty points capacity and some sort of realistic appeals timeframe"". He spoke of a sense of alienation and of how it was getting deeper. He said:Many of these communities are dying on their feet. The way this issue has been handled is adding to the sense that marine issues are not a priority, not just for the Government but for the central government system full stop. If we deal with this collectively as an Oireachtas and deal with it in a progressive way working together, we can start addressing these issues and lay some sort of pathway to addressing that alienation.I endorse those remarks 100%.  The motion was passed, making it an historic motion.In fairness to Pat the Cope Gallagher, not only did he have this statutory instrument annulled in the days that followed, he produced a document - I have read through it - containing amendments to the instrument. I have it with me. He did that in full consultation with the fishing industry. His amendments would have solved the problem, but nothing was done and time drifted on. We then come to 28 August 2020, when the Taoiseach, as acting Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, signed off on SI 318 of 2020, which was almost identical to the 2018 statutory instrument. The core objections were not addressed. I found out about it on a Friday evening. At first, I thought it had to have been a misunderstanding because there was no way the Taoiseach would have done that without consulting the fishing industry. However, I found out the next day that he actually had done it. I still thought that he might have been misled and that he had not understood the full implications of what had been done. My party put this annulment motion on the Order Paper, but we held back because we talked to the fishing industry, which was of the belief that, if it engaged with the new Minister, Deputy McConalogue, he would surely see the need to make Pat the Cope Gallagher's amendments to the statutory instrument. By the way, I emailed those amendments to the Minister, but I have still not received a substantive response. The producer organisations then met the Minister, which believed that they could turn the situation around. They were bitterly disappointed with that meeting. Subsequently, they sent a letter to the Minister on 18 September in which they identified four issues. First, the burden of proof is based on the balance of probabilities. As we all know, a prosecution must be beyond a reasonable doubt. That is the threshold, except for fishermen. Second, the points remain on a licence even in the event of the person or persons being exonerated in court. Third, the points attached to a licence if the tonnage is sold on multiplies on the next person's licence. Fourth, people can only appeal to the High Court on a point of law. No substantive response has been received to that letter to the Minister. We are debating this matter because, incredibly, the Taoiseach has signed a statutory instrument that is in clear defiance of everything Fianna Fáil as a party did in 2018. He actually voted for the historic motion on 29 May 2019. I appeal to the Government to do the right thing. In particular, I appeal to the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party. I could have read quote after quote after quote. I would invite anyone to read the Official Report. I would not challenge a word of what a whole ream of Fianna Fáil Deputies said in that debate. Everything they said was spot on. It was powerful stuff, yet here they are as a party. How will they stand over this? It is profoundly unjust. While dealing with Brexit, I spoke to a senior fisheries spokesperson in recent days who stated that this was the greatest threat to our industry since the foundation of the State. We have seen the submissions the industry has made to the previous Oireachtas committee. The industry is deeply concerned. I appeal to the Government to do the right thing and re-engage. I hope that its Members will not vote this motion down tomorrow, but even if they do, there is still a chance to amend the statutory instrument. The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation has already made it clear publicly that it will challenge this instrument in the courts again, but it should not have to. We have already spent a fortune in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine going to the High Court and Supreme Court defending the indefensible. Will it do so again? Will this matter go to the courts again? We can avoid that. I am not being party political. Let us use the template of Pat the Cope Gallagher's amendments. What is the Attorney General's view on them? Has the Minister sought his view on whether they are permissible? I have no doubt that they are. Has there been proper engagement on this matter? How the situation has been handled by the Taoiseach is a scandal. I am shocked that a solution has not been found. We did not want this debate. We would never have tabled this motion for Private Members' business had the fishing industry not told us to go ahead because it was not getting anywhere itself."	spk_279
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	47	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2020-09-29	dail	33	European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 318 of 2020): Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_29	This is a sorry saga. I will give the Minister genuine advice across the floor. He urgently needs to get a grip of the people who run the marine section in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. In all of my eighteen and a half years in politics, I have never come across such wall of distrust between those who a Department are supposed to represent and the Department itself. I have spoken to fishermen and fisherwomen up and down the coast since I took on the role of Sinn Féin spokesperson for fisheries and the marine. In every single sector, including inshore fisheries, which the Minister knows well, whitefish fisheries, pelagic fisheries and offshore fisheries, they have a huge distrust of those who run the marine section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. They had to take them to court twice and they were vindicated. They went to the highest court in the land. These people in the Department spent a huge amount of taxpayers' money and they lost again and again. Fianna Fáil brought forward a motion, led by former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, which represented a huge moment because a statutory instrument was voted down for the first time in the history of the State. I read over every single speech that was made, line for line, when we put this annulment motion on the Order Paper and I read them again today. If the Minister reads back what he said and what every single Fianna Fáil spokesperson said that night in comparison with what he has said tonight, he will see that it is like two different people were speaking. It is shocking. I cannot convey to the Minister how angry these fishing representatives are, many of whom have supported Fianna Fáil through thick and thin over the years. They said to me that we should hold back on this annulment motion, that they would get a meeting with the new Minister because he is from Donegal and that he will understand more than anybody the need to address this issue. They said the Minister would engage with former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher on the amendments he brought forward to the previous statutory instrument. Those amendments would have solved the problem, addressed the concerns of the fishing industry and built trust at last between those who put their lives at risk to earn a living all around our coast and those who run this Department. It would have been a big and important moment but here we are again tonight. The Minister's speech reads almost identically to what the former Minister, Deputy Creed, said two years ago. He gave a deeply alarmist speech, lecturing those across the Chamber and talking about the financial cost of the amendments. What about the cost of going to the Supreme Court or the costs for the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, which will be forced to take a legal case again, which it may well win? This should not be necessary. One of the comments made by the former Minister, Deputy Calleary, was that we need a Minister of State for the marine. That is what he said in 2018 and he referred to former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher and his track record. The Minister needs somebody who will get a grip of this Department. The Minister himself will be overwhelmed with all of his immense responsibilities in agriculture. Yet again, the marine section of the Department will be allowed to run riot on its own with no Minister or Minister of State to hold it to account. It will have warned the Minister of all sorts of unintended consequences and told him about the views of Attorneys General and of legal views. It will bamboozle him with all of this. Yet when one looks at a report from the European Union itself in July of this year, it is very clear that the systems in place all across Europe bear little resemblance to this one. This is a system where on the balance of probabilities somebody can be convicted and have his or her livelihood taken away, whereas if the Minister or I were stopped by a garda, we would have the right to go to a court and would be presumed innocent until proven guilty. If we were found innocent those penalty points would be removed and they would not take effect because the burden of proof would be beyond reasonable doubt. Whoever wrote that script for tonight and said to the Minister that it is acceptable that the balance of probabilities is an acceptable threshold is letting him down and failing him.The Government may well vote tomorrow night in total defiance of every word said by every one of those Fianna Fáil Deputies. I read through every line spoken by those Fianna Fáil Deputies two years ago and there is not one with which I disagree. Charlie, I will say that - apologies, I am speaking to the Minister but if I am informal it is because we know each other as Donegal representatives - these representatives of fishing organisations feel betrayed, and if the Government votes against this tomorrow night, the Minister will have a major job to do if he is to reach out to the fishing industry and break down the wall of distrust. He will have to stand up to the senior officials in his Department. It is the view of the people in the fishing community that they are being criminalised and treated like second-class citizens. The Minister must know that from speaking to them. The Minister's actions will only entrench their view even more and push the gap further. We are an island nation and we have a large marine resource. We should be enriching coastal communities and not criminalising them. These are the implications of the decision being made by the Government. Whatever way he votes tomorrow night, the Minister must urgently reflect on the need to stand up to those officials and make a stand as a Donegal man against those officials on behalf of the people he represents.	spk_311
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	47	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2020-09-24	dail	33	EU-UK Negotiations on Brexit: Statements	dbsect_21	The Minister will be very familiar with the issue of jurisdiction over Lough Foyle. In November 2016, the then British Secretary of State, Mr. James Brokenshire, declared that the whole of Lough Foyle was within the UK.That has always historically been rejected, not just by the Irish Government, but by the Irish people. The facts are that the British Government and the Crown Estate claim jurisdiction over all of Lough Foyle. One of the outworkings of the failure to resolve this issue is that we now have large numbers of unregulated oyster trestles along the western shore of Lough Foyle. Can we think of anywhere else around the coast of this State where we would tolerate a huge proliferation of aquaculture that is unregulated? Because of the failure to resolve the jurisdiction issues, we are left with this scenario. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, to engage urgently with the British Government to draft joint legislation. These are disputed waters and we accept that they are disputed. However, we need to have joint legislation that gives bodies like the Loughs Agency increased powers to regulate aquaculture. It goes further than that, however. We now have the issue of Brexit, the withdrawal from the London fisheries agreement of the British Government and the fact access to their waters is front and centre of these trade negotiations. We are left with a sense that the failure to resolve this issue puts the fishing community in the Inishowen peninsula in serious peril. We need to get clarity from the British Government on its intentions, particularly in regard to the fishing waters in Lough Foyle and north of our island. I was speaking to a very prominent representative of the fishing industry in Ireland just this morning and his words were that the biggest threat to the industry in 100 years is Brexit. I ask for reassurance from the Minister on what he is doing about that issue and what he is doing to resolve the huge problems around Lough Foyle.	spk_173
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	47	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2020-09-23	dail	33	Covid-19 (Transport): Statements	dbsect_16	I wish to raise directly with the Minister the serious problems that have emerged with school transport in Donegal and across the rest of the State. The Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, overlooked the school transport challenge under the umbrella of the back-to-school plan in a very clear way. Every year at this time, families are always left behind under the eligible and concessionary tickets system. It is a major problem in rural areas, including rural Donegal, because parents may have to travel 20 miles, or maybe more, in one direction to get to work although the school is in the opposite direction. It is not practical for parents to get to work on time, put a roof over their family's head and get their children to school. Post-primary school is the concern in the case in question. Every year, there are families left behind. We work through it with Bus Éireann and the Department of Education and Skills and find a solution. This year, however, what has been said to Bus Éireann is that any families who did not avail of the ticket before 4 August will have to wait until 50% capacity is reached. In the likes of Donegal, the private transport operators joined other operators across the State to appeal for financial supports beyond the pandemic unemployment payment. Their industry is in genuine crisis and they really were not financially supported by the Government. They were left blowing in the wind. Those very people are now being asked to bail out our school transport system in order for it to reach 50% capacity. This would of course be desirable in the current climate but surely to God the first thing that should be done is look after the families who have missed out. When the Department of Education and Skills instructed that the portal application system be opened, we all believed the directive had changed. I learned very quickly it had not and that the instruction to the bus operators who work under Bus Éireann was that they are not to allow a child on a bus unless he or she has a physical ticket from before 4 August.Lots of families have been left behind and this is a huge crisis for them. In summarising later, will the Minister address what he, working with the Minister for Education and Skills, will do to resolve this issue?  I will tell him what the solution is and it is very simple. First, Bus Éireann, working with the Department of Education and Skills, must ensure there is capacity for every single child or student who needs it, be it on an eligible or concessionary basis. As the Minister will be aware, concessionary means the parents pay for the service. Parents are, or course, willing and happy to do that but we cannot leave them behind before we look for 50% capacity. The solution is simple. A clear statement should be issued to Bus Éireann that the Department of Education and Skills, in conjunction with the Minister's Department, will resource this service to make sure nobody is left behind, after which it will push towards 50% capacity. The Department must ensure the private transport operators are resourced in order that they can bail out the Government in this regard. I am sorry for eating into my colleague's time.	spk_230

I heard the Taoiseach on the radio yesterday calling on influencers, whoever they are, to help build public confidence in the public health measures. Last week, he had a go at various Opposition spokespersons regarding their co-operation with Government, yet he denied the Opposition the ability to scrutinise these public health regulations. He did not agree to a debate on them. As we speak today, in the Assembly in the North, members are debating and scrutinising the regulations up there and making themselves accountable to the public in respect of those regulations. I, therefore, ask the Taoiseach again, will he make space for debate on these regulations? More importantly, we need a debate on the Government's testing and tracing strategy. The Government is demanding huge sacrifices of our people, which we dealt with on Leaders' Questions, but what responsibility has it to stand up to its failure in this area?

There is a sense that they signed up to a partnership in this strategy or plan and we hear, one year on, that there have not been meetings of the implementation group and there is no evidence that this report is being implemented. The sector feels abandoned. I ask the Minister again to meet NIFA as soon as possible to listen to their concerns and then act on them. 	spk_461
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	47	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2020-09-10	dail	33	Report of the Committee of Standing Orders and Dáil Reform: Motion	dbsect_18	It is not agreed. As the Ceann Comhairle will be aware, we have had some dialogue today and my party has made a submission which would permit all Dáil business to return to Leinster House. The optics of us being in this cavernous space while we are asking hundreds of thousands of workers and students to wear masks and keep 1 m apart if they cannot achieve 2 m are not good.It is unsustainable. Increasingly, there is agreement around the House on this. This motion is premature in that we need to find a solution to this in the week ahead and get our business back to Leinster House as soon as possible on the same basis that we are asking hundreds of thousands of workers and students to conduct their business. On that basis, we are opposing this motion and pressing it to a vote.	spk_103

Those fishers learned about this 11 days ago and I have spoken to many of them since. I was speaking to fishermen on Arranmore Island yesterday and they are absolutely shocked that the Taoiseach signed off on this when he voted against exactly the same statutory instrument in 2018. The Minister also voted against the proposal at that time. Both the Taoiseach and the Minister were right in how they voted on 29 May 2018. The Minister will recall that, at that time, the then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on the marine, Pat The Cope Gallagher, introduced the motion. I have re-read what he had to say and he was spot on in his criticisms. Not only had he criticisms, he subsequently put forward amendments to the regulation that provided solutions to the problems he identified. The Dáil voted down a statutory instrument from a Minister for the first time on 29 May 2018 and it has not happened since, to my knowledge. The Dáil was right to do so because the contents of that statutory instrument and the one that has been passed in recent weeks were outrageous. Imagine a scenario where a Garda issues penalty points to a driver. The driver says that he or she has done no wrong. The Garda then gets to select the judge who will hear the case and penalty points are still applied even though due process has not been exhausted. The driver then has no right to apply to a higher court. The same situation is happening here. The wording of the statutory instrument is incredible. It talks about decisions being made on the balance of probabilities. Under our common law system and Constitution, a person has a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Those who are accusing a person, particularly when the State is the accuser, must prove his or her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and yet the balance of probabilities is the standard under this statutory instrument. There is also an issue around the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority. A review is being carried out into that organisation but it is yet to be published so we do not know what recommendations it contains. There are serious concerns about the lack of accountability of the organisation.We are going to give them the right not just to detect but to adjudicate, something that is unheard of in the justice system. The Minister will know we have tabled an annulment motion which is almost identical to that tabled by former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher in 2018. We have held back on it in good faith and I have been asked by fishing representative organisations to give them a chance to meet the Minister and put their case. We believe that fair play can prevail. I am aware that the Minister will meet fishing representative organisations soon. I ask him to resolve this issue because, as he said eloquently in 2018, he knows this is wrong.	spk_305

I wish him well in his brief and look forward to working with him constructively. He is, like me, from a coastal county and knows well the concerns of fishermen and the sense that they have been criminalised. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been focused on enforcing rather than facilitating and supporting our fishing community to take the maximum wealth possible from our seas in order to have sustainable communities all around the coast. I am really alarmed at the range of fishermen in every sector I have spoken to who have no confidence in those at senior levels in the Department. A huge gap of distrust has built up. That is the problem with this statutory instrument. The Minister and his colleagues rightly challenged this two years ago and did something unprecedented in the history of the State, namely, voting down a statutory instrument and asking the Government and the then Minister, Deputy Creed, to go back to the drawing board. Over two years later they have still not listened to the concerns of fishermen. I understand the Minister will meet representatives of fishing organisations early next week. It is imperative he addresses the real and genuine concerns of fishermen. I have yet to meet a fisherman who has said to me that he or she does not believe there should be penalty points. They all support the principle of penalty points but there has to be fair and natural justice and the right to appeal must be in place as it is for any other citizen who is accused of an offence. The High and Supreme Courts have rejected the propositions drafted by the Department on a number of occasions. The Dáil has rejected its proposition. When the Minister meets fishing representative organisations and listens to their constructive ideas, a solution can be found to meet everybody's concerns. I look forward to his meeting with representatives. I am acting in good faith in not pushing our annulment motion but if we do not see a genuine attempt to address these concerns, we will have to put the motion before the Dáil eventually.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	47	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2020-07-30	dail	33	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	dbsect_58	For weeks the various political parties and groupings on the Dáil reform committee and Business Committee have debated the issue of proportional speaking, dealt with the issue of committee formation and a range of other issues to try to make this place work for everybody and be fair to everybody. The secretariat brought forward proposals a number of weeks ago relating to modelling for proportionality to be fair to everybody. Those proposals were not accepted and we had Government proposals as we come to the end of this Dáil term. What has happened here tonight is deeply regrettable. Our party put forward a proposal to the Business Committee today to try to find a compromise between the legitimate requests for all of the Deputies to have an equal opportunity to speak in this Chamber. No matter what party one comes from, as a Teachta Dála for one's constituency, one has an equal right to have a say in this Chamber. We put forward a proposal that sought to strike a balance between that legitimate view and the current running order in place for Second Stage and Statements. We put that compromise proposal to the Business Committee today and, unfortunately, we have come to this. What I was trying to do earlier was make a point of order to point that we have tabled an amendment to this motion, which is the compromise proposal from earlier. The smaller parties, in fairness, have also come forward with compromise proposals in their amendments. What has happened here tonight is deeply regrettable and it does not reflect well on any of us. We could have resolved it today at the Business Committee. I am sorry to be in this place and I hope that, when we come back in September, we can reflect on the need for all voices to be heard and for proportional speaking opportunities. I make the appeal at the eleventh hour to the Government to consider the amendments to the motion and to allow us to proceed on that basis.	spk_515

We will take five minutes each. I will raise two issues with the Minister. The first is the issue of carers, which has previously been mentioned. They are obviously a vital group in our society but they have not got the appreciation they deserve over the past three months. They have taken on incredible responsibility and been under incredible pressure without the normal respite support they would expect.That ranges from children with disabilities to looking after parents with a range of disability challenges. It is important that we take this opportunity to acknowledge the vital role they play. If there is going to be a full five-year Dáil term, we must do better for carers overall, but now they need to know when respite services will be reinstated in their communities and when they will get a break in terms of schools and community and health facilities in their areas. I ask the Minister to respond to that. Although I probably do not need to say this to him, I take this opportunity to express to them the appreciation of the Oireachtas at this time.	spk_52
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	47	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2020-06-11	dail	33	Covid-19 (Health): Statements	dbsect_3	The next issue I wish to raise is the investment that will be required in the health service as we emerge from this crisis. I will take the opportunity to give the example of my home county of Donegal, with which we are both familiar. Letterkenny University Hospital is the sixth largest hospital in the State and a major acute hospital. Let us consider the situation before this crisis occurred. There were 17,000 people from the county on waiting lists for inpatient and outpatient procedures and appointments. If one includes Sligo hospital, it is one in eight of the county's population on waiting lists, and the lists are growing all the time. The acute stroke unit was delayed. The Minister will be familiar with the campaign for the diabetes centre of excellence. We have the numbers of type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients in Donegal so there should be a centre of excellence at that hospital. Then there is the reopening of all the beds in the short stay wards. All of these, and I could go on, were delayed because of the recruitment embargo that was in place. There is also the trolley crisis. There was an average of 19 people on trolleys in the emergency department every day over a period of years. We must do better. I have given the example of Donegal but that is the case across the State. What are the Minister's plans or what is his vision for the next Government to have the necessary investment in nurses, doctors and beds and to move forward with the transition to Sláintecare? The vision is positive and we all subscribe to it, but where will the investment come from? What assurance can the Minister give today? People are concerned when they listen to the debates on the radio that this crisis has taken away the resources required to turn our health service. One thing we must learn from this crisis is that we can never again have the health service we had going into the crisis. We must have a very different health service. Can the Minister give a reassurance on that today?	spk_54
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	47	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2020-05-27	dail	33	Covid-19 (Local Government): Statements	dbsect_10	I will speak for three minutes and allow the Minister of State a minute to respond. He will know that there are many thousands of homeowner families across the State who have been devastated by a range of serious latent defects in their homes, from the pyrite crisis in Dublin and north Leinster to the scandal of Priory Hall and the mica and pyrite problems in Donegal and Mayo, as well as the fire safety and structural defects discovered in homes all across the State. We have resolution schemes for pyrite and for the Priory Hall residents. Today, I want to talk in detail about the mica and pyrite resolution schemes for Donegal and Mayo and call on the Minister of State to outline what he is doing for all the families in the State affected by latent defects. It is devastating for all of them and we need solutions in all cases. In my county of Donegal, thousands of families have been absolutely devastated. I have been in homes where people have been in tears. They are destroyed because their family homes, their wee castles to which they look for security, are literally crumbling around them. People have had to move out of their homes and we are talking about thousands of homeowners. They have waited for years for a resolution and there has been a long campaign led by the Mica Action Group in Donegal. That campaign is related closely to the campaign in Mayo and the two schemes are linked. As I said, I want the Minister of State to spell out clearly today what he is doing for all the families affected by latent defects. In the case of Donegal, we need to know when a scheme is going to start. When can people bring engineers from the engineers panel out to their homes to assess the damage and see what needs to be done to make their homes safe so they can start to plan for the future and start to breathe again? When will that commence and when will people be able to draw down the funds? Finally, the scheme that has been announced will be 90% funded. If we are talking about a home that will cost €250 million to completely rebuild, refurbish, put in furnishings and so on, 10% is a lot of money for people to find. There is also the cost of accommodation rental and storage of household goods during the long period of construction and refurbishment. It is a huge amount of money for the families who have waited all these years. Will the Minister of State reconsider the 90% limit or, alternatively, will he engage robustly with the banks, which still own many of these properties and assets and will benefit hugely from the scheme, so that they step up and make up the 10%?I await the Minister of State's responses with anticipation.	spk_330

As she well knows, a large number of employers in the hospitality sector and a range of other sectors had poor cashflows. They laid off their workers, being aware that they could avail of the PUP. One business person in Donegal told me a story. A chef working for that business had paid taxes and social insurance for decades but was left with no support from this State, yet the young person who had been washing dishes for just weeks got €350 per week. How is that fair or defensible? As the Minister is aware, many workers are benefiting from the PUP rather than the wage subsidy scheme. There is a much higher uptake. As such, it is not in any way reasonable to use it as a defence. How can the Minister argue that she is in line with European rules by not paying workers who are resident in the North the PUP and instead paying them through the wage subsidy scheme? How can it be done for one scheme but not the other? She cannot stand over this.	spk_313

This Government has not invested in the past five years. Hopefully, that will change in the next period. There are also massive structural issues in An Garda Síochána. Many of the challenges we face - ""challenge"" has been a kind word in recent years - are down to mismanagement and our front-line gardaí being failed by a management system that is not delivering for them. This and previous reports from the Garda Inspectorate, particularly the past two reports, are tremendous pieces of work. I do not like the term ""police force"". I see it as a police service. If the reports were implemented, we would have the police service we deserve. The Garda Inspectorate has earned respect due to the way it has produced these reports in recent years. It is not confrontational. Robert Olson is very diplomatic and reasonable in his tone. When somebody like him and his team say that they are exasperated because their recommendations are not being implemented, we need to listen.

I wish to get a sense of the Minister's plan to strengthen the performance of the criminal justice system to tackle white collar crime. Citizens have been disillusioned in recent years because they see people going to prison for not paying small fines while those who are responsible for bankrupting the State seem to be getting away scot free. There seems to be a difference of emphasis. What is the Minister going to do about it?	spk_33
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	43	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2016-01-27	dail	31	White Collar Crime	dbsect_3	I am mindful that what the recent Garda Inspectorate report said about the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is very worrying. It said the GBFI was struggling to cope with the scale of the number of cases brought before it and recommended change in respect of the bureau. In 2014, Remy Farrell, SC, heavily criticised the lack of resources available to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Those offices faced significant cuts. The response of the State, which was literally bankrupt because of the reckless behaviour of white collar criminals and which was facilitated by poor regulation among other issues, was to cut funding to the very agencies tasked with ensuring that did not happen again. Substantial cuts in funding were made to all those bodies. Will the Minister outline the investment that has been made in those bodies considering that, as we speak, the Garda Inspectorate report indicated they are struggling to cope?	spk_35
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	43	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2016-01-27	dail	31	White Collar Crime	dbsect_3	I cannot think of any other state in the world that was literally bankrupted by the behaviour of white collar corruption and criminality, where the people were so outraged, and where funding was subsequently cut to the very bodies which are at the front line and supposed to be tackling that. In 2014, three years into the Government's term of office, Remy Farrell, one of the most eminent senior counsel in terms of tackling such criminality in the State, said there was never a better time to be a white collar criminal. One of the proposals put to the Minister in 2014 and 2015 was from the columnist and respected commentator, Elaine Byrne. She proposed having an independent audit of the capacity of the oversight agencies to do their job, namely, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the ODCE, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigations, the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, NBCI, and the Competition Authority. She suggested overarching oversight of all those bodies would best be provided by An Garda Síochána to ensure they acted in a joined-up manner. Has the Minister taken on board Elaine Byrne's recommendation and what will she do to address two issues, namely, the capacity of those bodies to do their job, which would be established by means of an independent audit, and the way they are resourced? I raise the matter because I do not believe the issue has been addressed. It has been the biggest issue in the criminal justice system and has been the biggest failure of the Government. I raise the matter in the last days of this Dáil to see whether the Minister can give an assurance that the situation will improve in the future.	spk_37

The Garda Inspectorate appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. It was agreed on an all-party basis that the report was excellent and that we wanted to see it implemented so the Opposition needs to see a detailed report from the Minister outlining the recommendations from all these reports going back ten or 15 years so we can see what actions were taken to implement them. We can then properly assess what is happening here.	spk_13

This Government has not invested in the past five years. Hopefully, that will change in the next period. There are also massive structural issues in An Garda Síochána. Many of the challenges we face - ""challenge"" has been a kind word in recent years - are down to mismanagement and our front-line gardaí being failed by a management system that is not delivering for them. This and previous reports from the Garda Inspectorate, particularly the past two reports, are tremendous pieces of work. I do not like the term ""police force"". I see it as a police service. If the reports were implemented, we would have the police service we deserve. The Garda Inspectorate has earned respect due to the way it has produced these reports in recent years. It is not confrontational. Robert Olson is very diplomatic and reasonable in his tone. When somebody like him and his team say that they are exasperated because their recommendations are not being implemented, we need to listen. I appeal to the Minister to supply the Opposition with a report on what actions have been taken following the recommendations. It would be excellent if she could do this."	spk_15

I wish to get a sense of the Minister's plan to strengthen the performance of the criminal justice system to tackle white collar crime. Citizens have been disillusioned in recent years because they see people going to prison for not paying small fines while those who are responsible for bankrupting the State seem to be getting away scot free. There seems to be a difference of emphasis. What is the Minister going to do about it?	spk_33
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	43	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2016-01-27	dail	31	White Collar Crime	dbsect_8	I am mindful that what the recent Garda Inspectorate report said about the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is very worrying. It said the GBFI was struggling to cope with the scale of the number of cases brought before it and recommended change in respect of the bureau. In 2014, Remy Farrell, SC, heavily criticised the lack of resources available to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Those offices faced significant cuts. The response of the State, which was literally bankrupt because of the reckless behaviour of white collar criminals and which was facilitated by poor regulation among other issues, was to cut funding to the very agencies tasked with ensuring that did not happen again. Substantial cuts in funding were made to all those bodies. Will the Minister outline the investment that has been made in those bodies considering that, as we speak, the Garda Inspectorate report indicated they are struggling to cope?	spk_35
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	43	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2016-01-27	dail	31	White Collar Crime	dbsect_8	I cannot think of any other state in the world that was literally bankrupted by the behaviour of white collar corruption and criminality, where the people were so outraged, and where funding was subsequently cut to the very bodies which are at the front line and supposed to be tackling that. In 2014, three years into the Government's term of office, Remy Farrell, one of the most eminent senior counsel in terms of tackling such criminality in the State, said there was never a better time to be a white collar criminal. One of the proposals put to the Minister in 2014 and 2015 was from the columnist and respected commentator, Elaine Byrne. She proposed having an independent audit of the capacity of the oversight agencies to do their job, namely, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the ODCE, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigations, the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, NBCI, and the Competition Authority. She suggested overarching oversight of all those bodies would best be provided by An Garda Síochána to ensure they acted in a joined-up manner. Has the Minister taken on board Elaine Byrne's recommendation and what will she do to address two issues, namely, the capacity of those bodies to do their job, which would be established by means of an independent audit, and the way they are resourced? I raise the matter because I do not believe the issue has been addressed. It has been the biggest issue in the criminal justice system and has been the biggest failure of the Government. I raise the matter in the last days of this Dáil to see whether the Minister can give an assurance that the situation will improve in the future.	spk_37

The schedule has changed very quickly. Unfortunately, I must leave because I must chair the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions at 4 p.m. I must leave soon to prepare for that. One of the issues of concern is the Good Friday Agreement. It requires that there be an equivalent level of human rights protection in both parts of the island. In the North, the law is such that sentences of up to 30 months may become spent. The Irish Penal Reform Trust, with which we agree, argues the term should be 48 months; hence, the amendment. At the very least, there should be equivalence with the law in the North. There is concern over political prisoners. The law has had an impact on their employment rights in many regards. The people of Ireland voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Good Friday Agreement, which calls for human rights equivalence across the island and for political prisoners to be able to move on with their lives as long as they do not reoffend. The legislation, as presented by the Minister, does not provide for equivalence.That is unfortunate because, as Deputy Pringle stated on the wider point concerning the time periods, depending on the category of offence, 12 months is not a sufficiently long period.	spk_372

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	43	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2016-01-14	dail	31	Hospital Emergency Departments: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_18	I have listened to Deputy Twomey and other Government colleagues for the past while. I know that Deputy Twomey is a general practitioner and has experience of the primary care system. I share his concerns. We watched the documentary about sugar, about the increase in diabetes and about lifestyle. These issues have been on the table for many years. The only difficulty I have is that one would think the Government Deputies had just taken up office for a couple months and were asking us to give them a chance to see what they could do. However, they have been in power for five years. What we have had is a case of chronic underinvestment in the health services. The chief executive of the HSE told a Sunday newspaper that the whole thing is up in the air. The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, knows that the issues are about chronic underinvestment. Let us discuss Letterkenny General Hospital, which has been linked to University Hospital Galway as part of the Saolta hospital group. It is simply not working. I was speaking on radio in Galway some days ago about some of the numbers relating to University Hospital Galway. The Minister will be aware that there are patients right along the west coast up to the top of Donegal who are being referred to the hospital in Galway. The inpatient and outpatient waiting lists in that hospital amount to 40,000. The inpatient and outpatient numbers waiting for more one year come to 5,000. Despite this, patients are being referred there from as far away as north Donegal. It is utterly stupid. Clearly, the necessary investment has not been put into the hospital. Let us consider the hospital in Letterkenny which is serving a population of 160,000 in Donegal. There are 15,500 on the waiting list for that hospital, including 1,500 who have been waiting over a year. Now, because the Government has not invested in the public hospital there, the HSE must refer people to private hospitals on both sides of the Border. This does not make economic sense. Since the Government has not recruited enough consultants and doctors, it has to hire locums and, in some cases, pay them two, three or four times more than it should be paying them. What the Government is doing does not make economic sense. I have spoken to senior people in the hospital in Letterkenny. It has been my hospital for many years. The only way I can describe their opinion is to say that they are in despair over what is happening to our hospital. It is our people's hospital. It is where our children are born and where our loved ones die. It is an integral part of our life, as it is in every other hospital in every community throughout the State. We have seen what has happened there. The number of inpatients going through Letterkenny amounts to more than 20,000 per annum. Despite this, we have had the lowest allocation of budget and staff of any hospital in the State.We have now been linked into the Saolta hospital group. At the start, the people to whom I spoke in the hospital entered into the process with an open mind. They thought things could not get much worse. As I said to the Minister, a year or two on they are in despair. It might do the Minister no harm to meet the clinical directors and senior consultants in some hospitals, have a cup of coffee with them and ask them to speak to him off the record about what is happening. His eyes would be opened. My local hospital is Letterkenny General Hospital. There are two permanent surgeons to cater for a population of 60,000. To run a 24-hour accident and emergency department in a hospital, a full coterie of consultants and specialties are needed to meet demand. There are locums, who are linked to two permanent surgeons. The Minister will recall that the consultant urologist, Mr. Kevin Moran, had to resign in despair in the early part of 2015 due to the lack of resources available to him. As the Minister knows, urology is at the heart of cancer care services. Only weeks later, a breast cancer surgeon, who also, like Mr. Moran, carries out other surgeries throughout the hospital, spoke on a local radio station and said he was on the verge of doing the same as Mr. Moran. It was a crisis. The Minister facilitated a meeting in Dublin. It was a good meeting thanks to the fact the consultant, Mr. Michael Sugrue, attended the meeting, told everybody in the room to cut their nonsense and described the reality of the situation and what was needed. We put in place a number of solutions. Some seven months later, they have not been implemented. The Saolta hospital group is all over the place. As I said, the issue is chronic underinvestment and a lack of doctors, medical staff, budgets, beds and capital. The same applies to the community hospital and primary care infrastructure in communities. All that has a knock-on effect. The Minister knows why we have an accident and emergency crisis. Sinn Féin worked hard over a long period to consult all sorts of experts to come to the Minister with the constructive proposal we have put to him. It is about investment because there is no other way around the issue.  The solution involves examining the fiscal space of €8.6 billion over the next five years. We would allocate €3.3 billion and recruit an extra 6,600 front-line staff because that is what is required. We would move the health service, on an incremental basis over a period of five years The people will soon decide on their Government for the next five years and whether it comprises those on this side or the other side of the House. I am interested in the comments of the Minister. He said if he took on the role of Minister for Health again and the people decided that was the way to go, he would like to have the budget and, what is interesting, the authority to do what needs to be done. Frankly, that is a load of nonsense. The Minister clearly has the authority, but the Government has not invested and put in place the resources required. Instead, we have heard the same nonsense today as we heard before about structural issues, staffing issues and things needing to be sorted out. The problems are always blamed on the system or the HSE when the core issue staring us in the face involves resources. We have given the Minister and the people a plan and that, and nothing else, is what will be required to turn this ship around.	spk_389

A number of NGOs advocate that a DSS should be set up as an independent statutory body with reporting responsibilities to the Department of Justice and Equality. Stakeholders have advised me they were not consulted about this move and do not support it. Who did the Minister of State consult with and did she take on board their concerns about this? Is she willing to reconsider their view that the decision support service should be set up as an independent statutory body similar to comparable bodies such as the National Disability Authority? I acknowledge that the Minister of State has engaged with stakeholders throughout the process. We have hundreds of amendments here again which some people criticise. I do not because I think it is a sign the Minister of State is listening and making changes. She has made changes on different Stages of the Bill; it will never reach a point of perfection but legitimate concerns have been brought to my attention. Is there time for reflection and change? If the Minister of State is adamant this is what she wants to do, will she set out the reasons why?	spk_97

I listened to what the Minister of State said and I understand this Government's policy of amalgamation of bodies. As Sinn Féin spokesperson on justice I have dealt with more legislation than most spokespersons. However, that is the nature of the justice and equality area. The Charities Regulatory Authority is a new body. The legal services regulatory authority that will soon be established will also be a new body. We would not stand for either of those bodies being subsumed into another agency. The independent policing authority is also a new body. Two pieces of legislation which came through this House in recent days provide for the establishment of independent authorities that, hopefully, will have the confidence of the people. While the policing authority is a step in the right direction, I have some concerns about it. Nevertheless, both bodies will be independent. I do not understand why the calls of the experts, the NGOs to which, as a Member of this House, I defer, for the decision support service, DSS, to be an independent statutory body cannot be delivered on given, as I have just outlined, this Government recently established the aforementioned bodies, and rightly so. They are new bodies being established in the justice area. I am sure that new bodies are also being established in other areas.  Is there a better way of doing this? I know that like me the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, respects and engages with the organisations I mentioned. Perhaps we should listen to them and make the DSS a stand-alone operation.	spk_100

The other bodies I mentioned are subsidised by central government. Although they raise additional revenue through levies from the charities and legal services sectors, they do receive public money also. The Minister of State's excuse for why the DSS is not being established as a stand-alone agency is that the Government is committed to not creating new agencies. I have just mentioned three newly established agencies, legislation in respect of which recently passed through this House. There is no grounds for what the Minister of State is saying. I do not understand this. It is obvious she is being advised by departmental officials that the DSS should not be a stand-alone authority. I sense that the Minister of State agrees with the stakeholders that a truly independent stand-alone agency would be preferable.I have just torn apart the very reason the Minister of State gave in the Seanad and here today. It has been torn apart. She said no new agencies have been created by the Government. I identified three in the Department of Justice and Equality. She then said they were self-funding. They are not. The policing authority is not self-funding and the other two are only partially self-funding. The Minister of State stated in the Seanad: The ideal would be a stand-alone agency. There is no disagreement about it. [Those were her words in the Seanad.] Unfortunately, the Government has committed not to create any new agencies. [That is not true.] Therefore, we had to find something more appropriate. That is also not true because the Government has created new agencies and it has funded them and they will continue to be funded. I ask the Minister of State to challenge her officials on this point. She should not press these amendments today. She should meet the representatives of the NGOs and acknowledge that the grounds she has given are just not there.	spk_116

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-17	dail	31	Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013: From the Seanad (Resumed)	dbsect_28	Obviously, the issue of consultation is a source of concern and many independent agencies have already been established by the Government. The best way to put these concerns is to quote what the respected Senator Jillian van Turnhout said during the Seanad debate:... it places the service within the remit of the Department of Health rather than the Department of Justice and Equality. Since legal capacity matters should probably be regarded as a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality, I question this move. Could this lead to confusion because decision support issues might be confused with mental health issues? Since the remit of the decision support service is much broader than mental health, I wonder about establishing it under the Mental Health Commission. I would have thought that this function would have been better established as an independent authority similar to the National Disability Authority with reporting responsibilities to the Department of Justice and Equality.This move has been made at the very last minute in drafting the Bill without consultation, but we will leave it there, as we have had this discussion already. The points the Senator made are very important. Placing this authority within the Mental Health Commission is not the best fit. This is no reflection on the commission. The Senator has made some key points and expressed them better than I have today. The issue goes beyond consultation and the need for an independent authority. We know that other independent agencies have been established. I can reiterate the points made. The problem is that the reporting mechanism is under the Department of Health rather than the Department of Justice and Equality. These are legal capacity matters which should not be confused with mental health matters. Senator Jillian van Turnhout made very strong points which have not yet been addressed.	spk_404

Of course, we cannot do this because we have established that the Government does not establish new agencies but amalgamates them.Accordingly, we, unfortunately, have to amalgamate this proposed body with the Mental Health Commission. Why did the Minister of State say this in the Seanad and here today when I pointed out Government has established new agencies? The Minister of State also claimed those agencies in question are self-funding, but I have explained the policing authority is not self-funding, while the other two agencies referred to are partially funded by the State. Does she still believe it would be best practice to establish this as an independent authority? Does she acknowledge that the Government has established new agencies? Does the Minister of State not find it alarming that all of the bodies that Deputy Ruth Coppinger and I listed earlier would like this to be an independent authority? The Minister of State indicated not just today, but previously, that it would be desirable to have an independent authority but, unfortunately, the reason she gave is the Government does not establish new agencies, it amalgamates them. I have pointed out the Government has established at least three agencies. Is there room for reflection on this? Does she take on board the points made by Senator Jillian van Turnhout in the Seanad that the difficulty here is the Minister of State is conflating different issues by putting them under the Mental Health Commission? While it is no reflection on the Mental Health Commission, I do not believe in sticking bodies under the one agency and that amalgamating them is the best practice. It certainly is not the best practice in this case. It is not my opinion but that of non-governmental organisations and experts which deal with this area. They feel it is poor practice and not the way to go. They have not been consulted about a serious decision.	spk_407

This is particularly concerning in the light of the potential situation where a child has been trafficked. The proposed amendment would bring the Bill more into line with the Separated Children in Europe programme and the UNHCR's definition of separated children. This definition was also recommended by the Irish Human Rights Commission in its observations on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the UNHCR also define both separated children and unaccompanied minors in their guidance.	spk_134

This is proposed to try to strengthen the Bill in terms of its definitions and also aims to assist in meeting our international obligation in terms of asylum seekers. Those of us on the Opposition side who have submitted amendments have engaged with the range of NGOs which work with asylum seekers. I do not question the Minister of State's integrity in this regard and I appreciate he must take legal advice and guidance from his officials on these matters. However, a range of NGOs that both he and I respect are experts on these areas and they have profound concerns. I did not call a vote on the previous amendment because I would like to have more debate on the issues raised in the different amendments and every vote stalls us for 15 or 20 minutes. Today we are going to see example after example of areas where this Bill is deficient. I believe that even at this late stage, the Minister of State should consider deferring it until the new year and should take the intervening period to engage with the NGOs in order to strengthen the Bill and address their concerns. Otherwise, we will end up with a Bill that the Opposition cannot support. That would be disappointing because we support the single application procedure. However, the problem is that this procedure dealt with in isolation from other matters that need to be dealt with and without providing the necessary protections means this Bill is not the one it needs to be."	spk_138
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-16	dail	31	International Protection Bill 2015 [Seanad]: Committee Stage	dbsect_13	I move amendment No. 9:In page 11, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:“(4) The Minister may provide for regulations on Reception Conditions and Facilities for persons subject to this Act.”.This amendment links direct provision to the Bill. The Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions considered the issue of direct provision over a considerable period of time. We visited and met asylum seekers in different centres across the State and we came to the conclusion that the system is not fit for purpose. Deputy Boyd Barrett is also a member of the committee and he worked hard on our report. On Second Stage, I said that over the past 15 years, our approach to asylum seekers is in contradiction to our international responsibilities. It is almost as is we are schizophrenic in our approach. In terms of overseas development aid, we have been world leaders and have the highest  On the other hand, we campaign for the rights of the undocumented Irish. We are economic migrants, not asylum seekers. I am a west of Ireland man, a Donegal man. Significant numbers of my people, including members of my family and myself, had to emigrate as economic migrants. Asylum seekers are people who come here alleging - in most cases they are genuine - they are leaving war-torn, desperate situations to try to form a new life. We have international obligations towards them and yet we have failed them for long periods. The single application procedure will speed up the application process, which means people will not be stuck in direct provision centres. However, we need to address the issue of the centres. The working group made many recommendations for improvement. I believe that imperfect as this amendment is, it is necessary. While the principle of the Bill is fine, we believe it needs significant amendment. It needs to be aligned with a proper reception and integration strategy for asylum seekers who come here. They need dignity. Ours is the only State in Europe that has opted out of the European directive that says that after nine months as an asylum seeker, a person is entitled to work. That is shameful and there is no other way to describe it considering our history. We are the only country in the world today that has a population lower than we had in the 1800s. We have a history of mass emigration, with 500,000 leaving in the past number of years - economic migrants to Australia, Canada and around the world.  I am not talking about an open door policy, but about a policy that meets our international responsibilities and that gives people dignity while we decide swiftly and fairly on their applications. That is what we want to achieve. We have not reached that point and that is the reason I want this amendment accepted. I want it to link these policies together. I appreciate the amendment may not be accepted and normally in that situation I would call a vote but I do not want to waste debating time. I call on the Minister of State to respond to my points and to give some assurance about how he will implement the issues raised.	spk_141
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-15	dail	31	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Second Stage	dbsect_3	The Bill is well overdue and I welcome its publication. This chaotic Government tried to kick this issue to touch for as long as it could in asking the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to look at the issue. Both committees were emphatic that we had to move to one-year bankruptcy but still months were allowed pass. Eventually the Government had to accept the demand for a one-year rule. In its last weeks it has struck the Government that maybe those in debt needed some more protection when struggling against the banks. This was a novel thought for the Government, but a blindingly obvious one for those of us working with people in debt in the real world day-in and day-out. I welcome that from the day of commencement a one-year bankruptcy term will be available for everybody in the county, North and South. The use of the boat to Britain to exploit the one-year bankrupt terms there will hopefully come to an end and debtors in Ireland will be able to face up to bankruptcy in our own court systems. I welcome that a businessman facing bankruptcy in Donegal now has the same rights and responsibilities broadly speaking as a businessman in Derry. Regardless of any wishful thinking expressed here today, I am under no illusion that this change will be a panacea to the country’s still huge debt problem. Those most likely to benefit are those with larger, more diverse debts. This is a solution more for the businessperson with many debts, business and personal, rather than for the homeowner whose debt is concentrated in a mortgage on the family home or even in a buy-to-let arrangement. For those people this move will be of limited use as the Government decided a long time ago that they were for the wolves or even the vultures. Let us consider the facts. There were 206 repossessions during the most recent quarter, but that does not include so-called voluntary surrenders. In truth, 422 families lost their homes during this period which was identical to the previous quarter. That means four families a day are losing their homes. When these figures were first published in March 2012 the figure was 165 homes for the first quarter in 2012. Even when arrangements are made with homeowners they are more often than not the most unsustainable kind, such as arrears capitalisation or split mortgages. Despite recent falls, the number of family homes in arrears of over 90 days stands at 8.7% of the total number of homes. In March 2011, the number was 6.7%. That shows the scale of the Government's failure. The idea of a tough Government making the banks act reasonably is well and truly dead. We have a walkover Government that has chosen the banks over homeowners and does not care about the social and economic consequences. My party supports the Bill as a pragmatic step but it is no cure for five years of bad decisions. It is in fact an admission of failure. The Insolvency Service of Ireland has failed to be an effective remedy for tens of thousands of families who found themselves in debt after previous Governments and the banks had ruined the economy. It was supposed to be an alternative to bankruptcy. That we are liberalising our bankruptcy laws here today shows that did not happen. Like every other measure taken by this Government to tackle the debt crisis it has not fulfilled its role. The former Minister, Deputy Shatter, told my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, that 18,000 people would use the insolvency service in its first year. Even now only 3,000 have made applications. That is a spectacular failure to deliver on one of the Government’s key initiatives to tackle the debt crisis. In case Government spinners get carried away, the impact even for those who qualify for this new arrangement is likely to be the loss of the family home for many. That is how bankruptcy works. A person's assets are evaluated and stripped away leaving the bare minimum. It does not have to be that way of course. There should be legal protections for the family home and solutions short of bankruptcy which protect the family home. However, that is beyond the imagination of the Government. The banks had to come first. The law had to be changed to let banks off the leash so they could repossess at will. Some will suggest the Bill creates a moral hazard. Some of them will have legitimate concerns about the future operations of our insolvency laws, but many of those shouting about moral hazard are perfectly happy to ignore the greatest moral hazard of the banks the people bailed out now repossessing the family homes of those same people. The mortgage crisis rages on with four families a day now losing their home. I hope this step helps prevent some evictions, but the overall pattern is clear. After five years of belated initiatives and failed pet projects we are now in the dying days of this Government tampering with bankruptcy rules. We had the mortgage-to-rent scheme. By October 2015, four years after the scheme was launched only 246 homes had been purchased under the scheme. Only 7% of the number of families the Labour Party claimed would avail of the scheme have been able to use the scheme successfully. A €20 million fund set up to help local authorities access the scheme has seen only €6 million drawn down to date.The Tánaiste set up an independent financial service. Up to €10 million would be paid by the banks in a scheme where we were told more than 2,000 accountants gave financial advice to people in mortgage distress. The banks would pay for each consultation with an accountant, which costs €250. The scheme failed miserably. I hope this Bill does help. My party will support anything that helps struggling homeowners and other stand up to the banks. It is far too late for thousands, unfortunately, and probably in a lot of cases far too little for thousands of others.	spk_6

Inpatient numbers exceed 20,000 every year. It is, therefore, a substantial hospital, serving a population of 160,000 across the county.Over the years, based on inpatient numbers, Letterkenny University Hospital has been allocated the lowest budget of any hospital in the State and the lowest number of medical staff. It has been discriminated against by Government after Government. There are serious concerns throughout the hospital about the numbers of staff, the budget and the impact it has on waiting lists and trolley numbers. As the Minister is probably aware, the number on trolleys in Letterkenny University Hospital continues to increase and in 2015 almost reached the peak of 2006-2007. Management of the hospital, acting on behalf of the Saolta hospital group, has instructed consultant surgeons to scale back on elective surgeries during the month of January and early February to make beds available for additional people who present in accident and emergency. The most recent figures on waiting lists at Letterkenny hospital show there are 13,950 outpatients, 3,338 of which have been waiting for more than a year. Those are citizens in Donegal who have been waiting more than a year for surgical procedures or appointments with consultants. There are an additional 1,742 inpatients on the waiting list, which is a shocking waiting list. It is well known in the hospital that this instruction will lead to the growth of those waiting lists. It is my view, and that of my party, that the Minister will focus on not having patients on trolleys this winter because it will not look good in the mouth of an election and to achieve this he will sacrifice patients on the waiting list. That belief was confirmed by comments made today by Liam Doran of the INMO. What choices has the Minister made? Will he intervene and send a clear message to the management of the Saolta hospital group asking why this instruction, which will result in the growth of the already shocking waiting lists in Donegal, has been issued? Why can it not address the issues in accident and emergency departments without growing the waiting list even further?  I also want to bring to the Minister's attention the profound concerns of senior staff in the hospital about this instruction. They have outlined those concerns to the management of the hospital which in my view is carrying out the instructions of its masters in the Saolta hospital group which in turn is carrying out the Minister's instructions. It is a political imperative to sacrifice patients in order to have as few people on trolleys this winter as possible. The Minister cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.

I was also alarmed to learn from the Garda Inspectorate report that even though a code of ethics was signposted in the Garda Síochána Act 2005, it is still not in place ten years later. I am sure the Minister will agree that report was a damning indictment of the repeated failure of the management of An Garda Síochána to implement recommendations from, not just Garda Inspectorate reports, but also a range of other inquiries, reviews and investigations over recent years. We are repeatedly told that they accept the recommendations in these reports but the recommendations are not being implemented. It was a damning indictment of the failure of the management of An Garda Síochána to act. The report was superb. I am also conscious that the Garda Inspectorate published a report on penalty points. In recent days, it has been brought to my attention that a considerable number of members of An Garda Síochána are still avoiding penalty points by utilising what is called a statutory exemption for emergency vehicles. The Minister and I, along with all citizens, would agree this should apply for a garda driving a Garda vehicle or their own vehicle while pursuing somebody engaged in the act of criminality. We can accept there are circumstances when gardaí have to use either his or her own vehicle or more likely a Garda vehicle. My understanding is that on none of the occasions when these members of An Garda Síochána had points terminated under statutory exemption for emergency vehicles measure did they prove they were using the vehicle in question for that reason. They are beating the rap unlike every other citizen. It was brought to my attention that a senior member of An Garda Síochána has repeatedly had penalty points terminated, even including in the middle of this year, 2015. I have seen the evidence with my own eyes. This senior member of An Garda Síochána claimed he was driving the vehicle under the statutory exemption for emergency vehicles. He is a repeat offender who, as far as I can see, has never had penalty points allocated. Here we are at the end of 2015 and the Minister has stood up in this Chamber and given us assurances that the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate, the Comptroller and Auditor General and others would be implemented by An Garda Síochána. On the basis of the information I have just given, will the Minister undertake an immediate review of all terminations of penalty points that are categorised a statutory exemption for emergency vehicles to ensure that they were genuinely using the vehicle to prevent a crime, with paperwork to back it up? I also ask the Minister to implement the recommendations that came through the Garda professional standards unit. There were two key recommendations. One was an evader unit to be set up to track the PULSE system to look at people who had points repeatedly terminated, be they members of An Garda Síochána or other citizens. The second was to have the statutory exemption issue dealt with. That is just one example and I could give the Minister many others where we have been assured that change is on the way and that recommendations will be implemented. Let us consider the three-year investigation of crime work, a milestone examination by the Garda Inspectorate. How many of those recommendations have been implemented? The Garda Inspectorate report, Changing Policing in Ireland, made 12 key recommendations, only two of which have been implemented. Unfortunately, there has been a refusal by management of An Garda Síochána to implement recommendations for change by the Garda Inspectorate and others. Here is my problem with all this. With the guidance of her officials, the Minister has decided to disempower the new policing authority from being as independent as it could be. I will give some examples. The Commissioner and deputy commissioner will be appointed and removed by Government. The Commissioner is accountable to Government. It has been stated that the Commissioner will remain accountable to Government on matters of national security but I say respectfully that is not accurate. The original provision on accountability is not altered. The Commissioner will remain accountable to the Minister for the performance of the Commissioner's functions and those of the Garda Síochána. This concerns all aspects of policing and not just national security. Policing plans, strategies and priorities must be confirmed by Government. Security priorities will be set by Government. The budget is determined by Government. The Minister can demand any documents of An Garda Síochána. The Minister can issue written directives to An Garda Síochána and to the authority. CCTV schemes must be approved by the Minister. Ministerial consent is required for GSOC to investigate the Commissioner. The Minister decides the number of senior rank positions. The Minister gives consent on the number of civilian staff, the appointment of members to the audit committee and the appointment of the CEO of the authority. The Minister decides what constitutes State security. Government consent is required for the Garda to work with a police service in another state.The Minister authorises delegation of the Commissioner's functions to the deputy commissioner. The Minister can appoint someone to inquire into any aspect of policing and statistical information on crime compiled by An Garda Síochána is to go the Minister and not to the authority. I could go on. Last week’s Garda Inspectorate report was a devastating report in terms of its implications for the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas to oversee An Garda Síochána. That is the reason we need a truly independent policing authority with the teeth to ensure that An Garda Síochána management oversees the change that is required. Frankly, the Government has failed again and again. I genuinely am shocked to learn that we do not have a cast iron penalty points system in spite of reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Garda Inspectorate, the PAC and everything we said about the penalty points system. We do not have a penalty points system that ensures whether one is a member of An Garda Síochána or a citizen that if one has been speeding there are only two grounds on which one would have the points terminated, namely, if one was bringing a family member to hospital in an emergency, with the necessary paperwork from the hospital to prove that was the case, and that members of An Garda Síochána would have to prove by means of a report on the PULSE system that they were in pursuit of criminals or suspected criminals in a vehicle. One would not just have the speeding charge waived. Garda management is failing to ensure the change that is required is being delivered even on that issue. That is why we need a genuinely independent policing authority with teeth and the ability to hold Garda management to account. The men and women of An Garda Síochána who are trying to do their job are being failed even more than any of us in these Houses. They are without leadership and the clear direction they require. At times they have issued penalty points only to see them terminated by a senior colleague for some derisory reason. That is why I am so disappointed with what we have seen in terms of the dilution of the authority. We have a conservative Department of Justice and Equality that has interpreted the Constitution in a conservative way to say that the Constitution which rightly gives authority to the Executive to protect the security of the State must be extended and interpreted to include all policing matters. The Garda Síochána, the police of this State, oversee security and policing. Because of that unique situation, the Department has interpreted the Constitution to give the Cabinet the power to continue to control policing to an extent that is not necessary. Given the information I and other Opposition colleagues have given the Minister and last week’s damning Garda Inspectorate report that repeatedly refers to the failure of Garda management to implement recommendations for change, will the Minister please reconsider her response to Opposition amendments? Will she please give the policing authority the independence it needs to hold An Garda Síochána to account, to make sure that we have genuinely learnt the lessons of all the scandals of recent years and that there is a new beginning to policing and that we have a police service that the men and women of An Garda Síochána can be proud of and want to serve every day, and in which we the people across the State can have true faith? I am shocked to learn what I did about penalty points. I have seen written evidence that some members of An Garda Síochána can still get off with speeding. In one case, a senior member of An Garda Síochána, who has repeatedly come into the system, in the middle of this year beat the rap due to the loophole that exists. The Minister must put a stop to that. I know she wants to, but she must now show authority and deal with the issue and call an immediate review of the statutory exemption for emergency vehicles. The Minister must ensure that every case that is registered on the system is examined to see whether there is paperwork to prove the vehicle was genuinely used to protect the public or if the driver was abusing the penalty points system, which I believe happens. Some gardaí believe they are higher, more powerful and more entitled than other citizens. After everything we have been through, that is a scandal and the Minister must put a stop to it in the absence of an independent policing authority. Next year I want an independent policing authority to do that but in the absence of such an authority being in place the Minister still has the power and she must call in the Garda Commissioner tomorrow and ask why she has not implemented the recommendations of all the Garda Inspectorate reports and why after everything we have been through with penalty points some gardaí still believe they are above the law. That is the challenge I set down for the Minister. I believe the Minister is genuine about her office. She must now take the opportunity to deal with this issue once and for all and send the message out to the brave whistleblowers who have taken a stand on this issue and to the Garda Inspectorate, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the members of the Committee of Public Accounts and the likes of Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly and others who have championed the cause and exposed this issue that it will be dealt with once and for all.	spk_420
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-15	dail	31	Garda Síochána (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015 [Seanad]: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage	dbsect_39	I will provide the evidence to the appropriate body but I am asking the Minister to request that the Garda Inspectorate immediately review all terminations of penalty points in 2015. In January, the GPSU completed its audit, which examined the issue of statutory exemptions of emergency vehicles that allowed members of the Garda Síochána to avoid penalty points. It considered both the latter and the issue of an evader unit. I am asking the Minister to immediately ask the Garda Inspectorate to review all terminations of penalty points based on statutory exemption of emergency vehicles to ensure they are terminated properly. I will not name the senior garda I mentioned; he is a superintendent and has had three terminations of penalty points. He was listed for eight separate offences and I do not see any evidence he has accepted or been issued with penalty points for any of those. On three occasions prior to 2015, he had penalty points terminated at different locations. He has also had penalty points terminated in 2015. I am pretty certain he did not incur those in the pursuit of somebody involved in criminality. I am happy to co-operate with the Garda Inspectorate and pass on the evidence I have on the superintendent in question. That garda has had penalty points terminated on four separate occasions since 2009 and possibly more on which summonses were not issued when he should have gone to court and faced the appropriate charges. If the Minister is so confident there is nothing to fear, will she ask for the Garda Inspectorate to be immediately allowed access to the PULSE system to review all terminations in 2015 made on the basis of statutory exemption of emergency vehicles to ensure every one was in order and occurred when a garda was in pursuit of a criminal. We would all accept it is absolutely fine to have penalty points terminated in those circumstances. Those are the issues. I ask the Minister to show evidence of how she or a predecessor have accepted and implemented the recommendations made by the Garda Inspectorate over a number of years. The particular focus tonight is on penalty points.	spk_424
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-14	dail	31	Prisons Bill 2015 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_5	Sinn Féin, obviously, supports the Bill. As previously stated, the main purpose of the legislation is to facilitate the complete closure of St. Patrick’s Institution. It repeals statutory provisions that enable the courts to order the detention of offenders under the age of 21 years in St. Patrick’s Institution and deletes references to “St. Patrick’s Institution” from the Statute Book. In part, the Bill has its origins in a commitment given in the programme for Government to end the practice of sending children to St. Patrick’s Institution. For decades non-governmental organisations, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and a number of international organisations, including the United Nations, have been calling for the closure of St. Patrick’s Institution and an end to the detention of children in adult prisons. Across the child protection and criminal justice spectrum there is unanimous agreement on the importance and significance of ending the practice of detaining children in adult prisons. For example, the Irish Penal Reform Trust has repeatedly pointed out that adult prisons are completely unsuitable in meeting the particular needs of young offenders. This sentiment was echoed by the new Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, who stated rehabilitation must be a paramount consideration in the detention of young people. The closure of St. Patrick’s Institution and the building of six new buildings, each with the capacity to house between eight and ten children, are positive steps. Again, the Ombudsman for Children and the Irish Penal Reform Trust agree that the Oberstown centre is the most appropriate environment for the small number of young people for whom detention is necessary. However, both entities have also expressed concern at the findings of a report by HIQA published on 23 February on two inspections it had carried out in the Oberstown centre in October and November 2014. Of a total of ten standards, HIQA found that the children detention schools met just one, that of education, in full. Six standards were found to require improvement, while the failure to meet three standards was found by HIQA to present a significant risk. These were in the areas of single separation, the management of medication and staffing and training issues. The isolation of any child or young person from his or her peers can be damaging and the standards are clear that isolation must only be used sparingly and for the minimum, appropriate period of time. The Irish Penal Reform Trust is particularly concerned at reports that single separation was used owing to staff shortages. Concerns about insufficient staffing, staff training and high levels of staff absenteeism are also detailed in the inspection report. In a 12-month period more than 700 cases of single separation were recorded at Oberstown, with one child spending more than 83 hours in isolation over a four-day period. It has been proved that in areas where there are supports for minors who are exposed to violence or trouble in their communities, these supports significantly reduce the number of children who get into trouble with the law. We must start to discuss the issue of early intervention and prevention. We must create a system which will be humane and progressive - a rehabilitation process which will encourage all children to reach their full potential rather than a system which will impact negatively on future generations for life. On prisons, it is worth reminding ourselves that the State’s reputation is justly criticised as being embarrassing. The Government should be embarrassed. Ireland is one of only four European countries not to have ratified the United Nations' anti-torture protocol. Professor Malcolm Evans whose work focuses on preventing torture and degrading treatment has expressed frustration that the Government has repeatedly promised but failed to ratify a system of independent, international inspections. At the last universal periodic review of the human rights records of all 193 UN member states in 2011 he said Ireland’s failure to sign the United Nations' anti-torture protocol was openly criticised, even by some countries with, historically, very poor human rights records. He said some would reach the conclusion that the justice authorities in Ireland had an issue with transparency and accountability. The protocol provides for UN and national bodies to make unannounced visits to all places of detention, including prisons, police stations and psychiatric hospitals, and report on what they find. The bodies have the power to examine the facilities and interview staff and detainees in confidence as part of the inspection process. Sinn Féin recommends expedited ratification of the protocol. It is a well accepted maxim that a society is best judged by its treatment of prisoners. In Ireland the issue of prison conditions has a special resonance associated with colonial rule and the legacy of conflict over centuries. Prisons were sites of execution, torture and ill-treatment of many thousands of political prisoners and inhumane warehouses for the destitute in an unjust and unequal society. Fundamental prison reform is a priority for my party and should be for all republicans. It is crucial that prisoners and children in the care of the State are not failed, as they have been for too long.	spk_21
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-11	dail	31	Ramming of Garda Vehicles Bill 2015: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_21	I apologise for not being present when it was my turn to be called. We support the motivations behind the Bill. In Donegal, we lost two fine officers, Gary McLoughlin and Robbie McCallion, in 2009. Killed in the line of duty, they were the victims of reckless drivers. It was devastating for our communities and, most of all, their families. It was a sad time in Donegal, so I sympathise with the motivation behind the Bill. What we disagree with is mandatory sentencing. Unfortunately, it has not proven a good approach to law, as I will explain. The Bill seeks to introduce a mandatory scale of sentencing of up to ten years for the Judiciary to apply in the specific case of ramming a Garda vehicle. However, the current law provides for up to ten years' imprisonment for dangerous driving in addition to substantial fines. Given the circumstances of the case, it is for the Judiciary to impose a suitable sentence. Related to the Bill is the wider issue of mandatory sentencing. Calls for mandatory sentencing feed into public distrust in a dangerous way that works to undermine and subvert the rule of law. The reality of mandatory sentencing is that it uses up scarce resources in terms of time and money when judges, in the interests of justice, must wrestle with ill-conceived laws. Such an approach would increase the number of trials and subsequent delays in the criminal justice system when people accused of offences that carry mandatory sentences pleaded not guilty. Mandatory sentences contribute significantly to the cost of imprisonment. Such costs result in either more taxes on citizens or significant tax takes being diverted from hospitals and schools to fund the results of ill-conceived political projects. According to the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, for every $1 million spent on California's mandatory sentencing laws, 60 serious crimes are prevented. However, that same $1 million would prevent 160 serious crimes if spent on training and assistance for families at risk or 258 serious crimes if spent on encouraging children to graduate from high school. If the intent of the Bill is to assist the Garda in carrying out its duties more effectively, I recommend that we consult the recent report of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate. It outlined that issues with vehicles continued to be a source of frustration for many gardaí, including vehicle allocation and concerns over whether some vehicles were fit for purpose. The ability to acquire vehicles is also constrained due to the requirement of adhering to the procurement process while attempting to purchase vehicles on the open market at a time when most vehicle stocks are depleted. Under the current budgetary process, the Garda is tied to an annual plan that does not adequately support a long-term vision. In cases where Garda cars are rammed, what are needed to protect gardaí are better, stronger and more powerful vehicles deployed in areas that are more likely to suffer such incidents. In order to build public trust in the judicial function, my party and I propose that the State introduces a sentencing council that would provide sentencing guidelines to the Judiciary. Similar councils are in place in England, Wales and Scotland and comprise a good model. This would ensure that sentences handed out for criminal offences in courts are consistent and accountable. A key strength of the sentencing council model is that it involves a range of key stakeholders, such as victim support groups, academics, senior police officers, senior parole officers and the wider public in the process of establishing sentencing guidelines for the Judiciary. As members of the Judiciary would be the majority members of the sentencing council and a senior member of the Judiciary would chair it, they would still be central to the process. However, the sentencing guidelines issued would ensure that the Judiciary stuck to the range provided for the category of offence before it. For example, if we engaged with the public and people involved in the criminal justice system on the question of what the appropriate range of sentences for ramming Garda vehicles was, we could provide a range of sentencing options to judges that would have to be applied in every case. One could achieve the desired level of accountability without there being mandatory sentencing. Under the council's sentencing guidelines, the Judiciary would also have to indicate clearly why it had sentenced an offender within that range, taking into consideration the impact on the victim and the blameworthiness of the offender. This would ensure consistency and accountability across the court system and the State. Our proposed sentencing council would develop sentencing guidelines, monitor their use and assess their impact on sentencing practice.It may also be required to consider the impact of policy and legislative proposals on sentencing, when requested by the Government to do so; promote awareness among the public of the realities of sentencing; publish information on sentencing practice in our court system; consider the impact of sentencing decisions on victims; monitor the application of the guidelines, better to predict the effect of them; and play a greater part in promoting understanding of, and increasing public confidence in, sentencing and the criminal justice system. Sinn Féin understands the motivation behind Deputy Griffin's Bill, but we need to say to the men and women of the Garda Síochána, who are at the front-line dealing with very dangerous criminals and protecting our communities, that we have robust laws and will give them robust resources to deal with that. This Bill is not the proper approach to take and, therefore, we cannot support it. Careful deliberation, consultation and work with the Garda to ensure they receive the resources needed to apply existing laws is needed.	spk_174
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-11	dail	31	Coroners Bill 2015: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_23	"I commend Deputy Clare Daly on the presentation of this important Bill, which my party will be strongly supporting. The Bill seeks to ensure maternal deaths result in automatic inquests. As it stands, maternal deaths are treated as deaths which must, as a rule or practice, be reported to the coroner. However, inquests are not automatically granted in these cases. Between 2007 and 2013, eight inquests were held following maternal deaths. All eight cases resulted in rulings of medical misadventure. The Minister of State mentioned the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 2 of which clearly outlines the responsibilities of every member state in terms of its duty to investigate deaths that take place in suspicious circumstances, or in circumstances that leave them open to question. Too many families in this State have been left facing the wall of bureaucracy on their own without the required supports. I want to say clearly today that the State is profoundly failing in its responsibilities under the European Convention on Human Rights and the Government knows it. As the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, I have been working in co-operation with my colleague, Deputy Stanton, who is the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. When both committees jointly held a day of hearings on this matter earlier this year, a range of experts made presentations and outlined the failure of this State to live up to its responsibilities. The transcripts of those hearings have been sent to the relevant Ministers, but what needs to be done is not being done.We have been faced with Bill after Bill in recent weeks, some of which have gone through all Stages in one day. When the Government wants, it can get Bills through the Office of the Attorney General and through all Stages. Therefore, there is no excuse for not having completed and made the necessary changes to the Coroners Bill 2007 by now. There is an opportunity to deal with this now. I fully support Deputy Daly's Bill going to Committee Stage. Apparently, we will have a couple of weeks of this Dáil after Christmas. We need to reconvene and the Government needs to take that opportunity to get this issue over the line before a new Government comes into power. It is a profound failure that this issue has not been addressed. As such inquests are not automatic, families who should be spending their energy dealing with horrific loss must instead fight for the true facts of what led to the death of their loved ones. This situation is neither rational nor just. Deputy Daly has highlighted the fact that legislation dealing with the deaths of women who give birth in hospitals is urgently needed. Sinn Féin concurs with that view. The only way in which one can improve the lives of citizens in this State is not to congratulate ourselves on things that go right, but to examine openly and without fear or obfuscation the circumstances that lead to wrong results and to ensure the tragedies referred to by Deputy Daly are not repeated. The culture of defend and deny that is rampant throughout this State in response to a fear of litigation not only costs the State millions as a result of medical negligence cases but also prevents safer and better quality of care for patients. The Irish Medical Council states:Patients and their families are entitled to honest, open and prompt communication with them about adverse events that may have caused them harm. Therefore you should;- Acknowledge that the event happened;- Explain how it happened;- Apologise if appropriate;- Give assurances as to how lessons have been learned to minimise the chance of this event happening again in the future.Therefore, when patients or their families are treated with resistance and concealment of facts pertaining to a death or injury, is it any wonder they seek the path of litigation? The position taken makes little sense. In cases where information is not forthcoming, it is usually that information that is most useful in preventing the same tragic events occurring in the future. As Dr. Jo Murphy-Lawless of Trinity College has pointed out:A maternal death casts a deep chill over the entirety of a maternity unit. Given the legal neutrality of a coroner's inquest in determining how a woman died, staff too would benefit from what we can learn through the inquest process. I want now to highlight a related issue. Some time ago I published a Bill, to be known as ""Jake’s Amendment"", to amend the Coroners Act 1962 to allow for a coroner to return a verdict of iatrogenic suicide. That Bill followed from the death in March 2013 of 14 year old Jake McGill Lynch who, shortly after being prescribed the antidepressant Prozac, ended his own life using a firearm. Jake, who was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, was given the antidepressant drug, despite research stating that the drug has no benefit for children with Asperger’s syndrome and despite the emerging evidence of harm. In the midst of their grief, Jake’s parents had come to understand that their personal tragedy was one that has been shared by thousands of families whose loved ones had died as a result of antidepressant-induced suicide. Jake’s parents wanted the Coroners Act to be amended in order that a coroner could return a verdict of iatrogenic - medically induced - suicide where such is the case. This is an issue that must be highlighted. A verdict of suicide returned in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1962 must be differentiated from a verdict of iatrogenic suicide. Iatrogenic suicide is the ending of one’s own life where the effect of medical treatment undertaken by the deceased, including any prescribed medication, is the primary cause of such an action. My Bill is in the system but, as the system here is a lottery, it is the luck of the draw whether it will ever make it into the House. This is frustrating, as I have repeatedly called for it to be taken. Therefore, when the Government is considering the Coroners Bill 2007 and addressing the issues raised by Deputy Daly today, I urge it to look also at the issue of iatrogenic suicide. In the case I mentioned, the coroner made a finding that gave some comfort to the family. One hopes lessons will be learned from that. I urge the Minister of State and his officials to take note of that when they consider these issues. The Coroners Act of 1962 is no longer fit for purpose and should have been repealed and replaced with an amended version of the Coroners Bill 2007 as a matter of priority. In the amended version of the 2007 Bill, there should have been a comprehensive list of verdicts open for a coroner or a jury, as the case may be, to return. This list should have contained provision for verdicts such as those mentioned by Deputy Daly or me today. Sinn Féin supports and commends Deputy Daly’s legislative proposal. It makes sense for families suffering tragic loss, in the context of preventing the recurrence of such tragedies, and of reducing traumatic and financially prohibitive legal actions."	spk_183
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-10	dail	31	International Protection Bill 2015 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_17	"This Bill promised to ensure asylum seekers were treated with respect and humanity within a framework of more efficient immigration procedures and safeguards. While Sinn Féin welcomes these attempts, the Bill fails to achieve those aims. It fails to embed the principle of the best interests of the child and the attendant weaknesses which will potentially expose children to harm.It fails to prevent the risk that wrong decisions will be made without adequate checks and balances and a right of redress. It fails in respecting the rights of refugees to obtain family reunification, vital if refugees are to be able to re-establish themselves in Ireland and settle in to their new communities. Sinn Féin submitted 45 amendments to the Bill in the Seanad in order to address these issues among many others, but the speed with which the Bill is being pushed through the Oireachtas does not inspire any confidence that the Government is taking the rights of the most vulnerable people seriously. This Bill introduces a single procedure for applicants seeking international protection, but it is a single procedure that will lead to the most vulnerable failing to obtain the protections they need. Like the leading NGOs which work directly with those seeking international protection, Sinn Féin cannot support the passage of this legislation as it now stands. There is an obsession by those who propose this legislation and are rushing it through these Houses that the introduction of a single procedure is inherently good. They have repeated it  When asked why he wished to pass this legislation so speedily through these Houses, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, stated that he felt fearful. The Minister of State feared that the next Government would not deal with the pressing issue of introducing an efficient procedure for those applicants seeking international protection. That fear is understandable; however, such fear leads to rushed decisions that may do more harm than good. While the Minister of State may repeat that the legislation is based on law that currently reflects protection principles, such as the best interests of the child principle, he must be aware that where legislation is not clear and does not provide certainty, it will end up being open to abuse where counsel does not bring it to the appropriate forum and where the adjudicator is unaware of its existence. Legislation is neither effective nor efficient when it does not clarify the law and where it may lead to legal uncertainty. That is what this legislation does. Its success rests on the belief that applicants will spend a maximum of six months before their application is accepted or rejected at first instance, and yet no such timeframe is present in law. Sinn Féin also submitted a reasonable amendment to the Bill in the Seanad that would allow personal circumstances to be taken into account in regard to reporting requirements. The Minister stated that this is, in fact, what happens in practice so there is no need to codify it in this Bill. That is astoundingly naïve. There is no valid reason that the amendment could not have been accepted by the Government. It would allow pregnant applicants to attend hospital appointments, certain in the knowledge that reporting requirements would be relaxed. It would allow children in school to freely attend sporting and educational competitions away from home without fear that such reporting requirements may prevent them doing so. That minor amendment would reduce fear in vulnerable persons seeking protection and, indeed, state what the Minister states takes place in practice. Rejection of it ensures that legal uncertainty remains for the most vulnerable of international protection applicants. I will turn to the claim made in the Seanad on Monday last that most of civil society and the NGOs backed this legislation. Either this was intentionally misleading or, more likely, the Seanadóir concerned had not listened to what the NGOs were actually saying on the published Bill. Either way, it does not inspire confidence in how well-thought out the legislation is. The NGOs to which the Seanadóir referred stated quite clearly that they want this legislation withdrawn. I will restate that position here so that we are all clear as to the position of Doras Luimní, the Irish Refugee Council, Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and Nasc. Those parties, which are experts in this area and have the best interests of those seeking international protection, want this legislation withdrawn. Ms Sue Conlan, CEO of the Irish Refugee Council, stated:A single procedure will not cure the problems in the Irish asylum system unless there are proper safeguards in place which protect asylum seekers from cursory examination of their applications and a swift move towards deportation. The outcome of passage of the Bill, as it stands, will lead to people being at risk of being returned to persecution or serious harm and refugees separated from family members. This will be at the time of the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War.Ms Fiona Finn, CEO of Nasc and a member of the Government's working group on the protection process which reported at the end of June, stated:The Minister claims that the Bill implements the key recommendations of the Working Group, this is simply not true. With the exception of the single procedure, the Minister has cherry picked a handful of the more conservative recommendations and ignored any positive recommendations, such as the right to work, early identification of vulnerable applicants, and the application of the Best Interests of Child principle for all asylum seeking children. In addition, the Bill erodes rights to family reunification and brings in harsher detention measures. The single procedure is necessary to improve the protection system, but not at this cost.Ms Leonie Kerins, director of Doras Luimní, stated:We are extremely concerned with the speed at which the Bill has been progressed. We see this as a deliberate attempt to prevent proper debate on the more alarming areas of the legislation. This legislation is an opportunity to address the failures of the current system and to bring Ireland in line with international practice and the Common European Asylum System in particular.The Government, in particular the Labour Party, should account for the blatant disregard with which it is treating the democratic structures of this State. It claims that, ""Labour has changed Ireland for the better, and has made our country a more modern, equal and progressive place for everybody"". Such hypocrisy. It is an insult to introduce this Bill on Human Rights Day. Is modernity reflected in the intrusive medical examinations on children in the absence of their consent that are facilitated in this Bill? Is equality reflected in the fact that victims of domestic violence are equally fearful of reporting violence inflicted by their partner in case it removes them from basic legal protections and opens up the appalling possibility of deportation? With regard to progressivity, this Bill reflects that persons seeking protection are seeing a progressive removal of minimum humane standards of international law. In the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016, the Government committed to treating asylum seekers with the humanity and respect they deserve. The speed with which this Bill is being subjected to scrutiny puts shame to that claim. It is a shame that these Houses will not be afforded the length of time needed to rectify these oversights or incorporate the expert opinions available to make a difference to individual asylum seekers. Sinn Féin stands in solidarity with the weakest in our society. Sinn Féin concurs with the opinions expressed by the experts and the Irish Refugee Council, Nasc, Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and Spirasi. I commend these organisations in their work and recognise their input into this debate. They are part of the wider democratic process and it is a pity the submissions they made on this Bill were not used to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of our legislative process. As I stated recently on the Garda Síochána (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, I believe that, historically, the Department of Justice and Equality has been a conservative Department that has been resistant to progressing change and that this issue of the need for the State to tackle the issue of direct provision centres for asylum seekers has been significantly curtailed. The issues those who hold right-wing views on asylum seekers and related matters would want addressed are speedy decision-making and deportation but those who are progressive in this State would want a supportive reaction for asylum seekers to reflect our history. What is the history of our State? What is the history of this island? Ireland is the only country in the world that has a population lower than it was in the early 1800s.It is due to mass emigration in the past couple of hundred years, not just during the period of the Great Famine in the mid-1800s but throughout our history up to recent times. In recent years, 500,000 residents and citizens of the State emigrated from counties such as mine and others throughout the west of Ireland to Canada, Australia and, in lesser numbers than before, Britain and America. A famous book written in the 1980s revealed that in the 65 years following the creation of the State, half of those who survived childhood emigrated. Our history is one of mass emigration, not as asylum seekers but as economic migrants. We have heard many speeches from Deputies on all sides, and rightly so, about the undocumented Irish and the need for us to give them the right to come home for occasions such as weddings and funerals if they wish, and then return to the US to work. However, our response to people in fear of their lives coming here from countries that have been devastated by wars, dictatorships and oppressive regimes, many of which were created or supported by the interventions of the West, has not been humane and respectful but shameful. In my capacity as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, I examined, along with colleagues, the direct provision system over a period of months. We visited the centres and met dozens of asylum seekers. Our report, which was endorsed by all parties, is very clear that the system is unfit for purpose and must be brought to an end. We cannot have adults and children languishing in receipt of €19 per week and €9 per week, respectively. We cannot have 4,500 applicants, of whom half are children, in the centres. Children grow up for years without being taught to cook and the basic things that happen in families are denied to them. The system is a betrayal of the otherwise decent approach of our people. A number of years ago, Ireland made the highest  The legislation is a major disappointment. The Minister should not take my word for it, given that I am far from the most important contributor on the issue. She should take the word of the NGOs that work with refugees. Those who work for the organisations in question are intelligent, thoughtful people who know our obligations under international law. They are very clear that the Bill should be withdrawn. Withdraw the Bill. The remaining Stages are scheduled to be taken next week. The Minister should take the opportunity to withdraw the Bill, take time out, return in the new year and make it a Bill worthy of the name. When she does that, she will be met with a response in kind, not just from me but from other members of the Opposition who are saying it is not good enough and that it is not the response that was demanded by the Irish people after we saw the images on the beach. I ask the Minister and her Department to reflect on what we are saying, to withdraw the Bill and bring forward a Bill worthy of the name."	spk_95
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-09	dail	31	Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011: From the Seanad	dbsect_16	"I am pleased to have another opportunity, by way of these amendments from the Seanad, to outline my perspective on the progress of this Bill since its introduction. I read with some intrigue the news reports in recent weeks, most of which entirely miss the point of what the legislation is about. Sometimes in these Houses we operate in something of a bubble and get caught up in policy and our own circular conversations. For citizens, the main issue they have with legal services is cost. People who find themselves in family law proceedings, civil law proceedings or whatever it may be often through no fault of their own are obliged to avail of legal services and then face a huge bill at the end of it. That adds to the stress they are already under. From the outset, this Bill has not done anywhere near enough to address that issue. We have been a long time waiting for progress on the proposed mediation Bill. The Oireachtas justice committee considered a proposed scheme for that Bill several years ago, before my time as justice spokesperson for Sinn Féin. That legislation is vital and I have repeatedly asked when it will be brought forward. We need to introduce a culture in this State whereby citizens, rather than going down the road of adversarial confrontations in court rooms, go into mediation. The significant majority of family law and civil law matters could be resolved through the efforts of skilled mediators who would be accountable to the Mediators Institute of Ireland or an independent regulator. Proposals drawn up by way of this mediation process would then be presented to a judge. I am sure the Judiciary would be delighted to see such a system being introduced. Unfortunately, however, the mediation Bill has gone nowhere for a long time. It would have done more than the Bill before us today to address the issues that most affect citizens as they interact with legal services. Yet there has been hardly a mention of the mediation Bill in the media.Journalists in this State need to have a look at themselves, because the narrative has been that the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, introduced this reforming legislation and then, due to the lobbying efforts of the legal representative organisations, the current Minister caved in. It might surprise those watching today that I do not accept that narrative. I have followed this process for a number of years. The previous Minister would acknowledge, as he has today, that the initial legislation was rushed, under the demand of the troika. It was considerably flawed. Having looked at the submissions made to the justice committee and from the interactions we, as Opposition spokespersons, had with the legal representative groups, their analysis, in the main, was sound and reasoned. They were not objecting to independent regulation of the legal fraternity. That is a very important point: they were not objecting to independent regulation. They felt the Law Society and the Bar Council had complaint handling procedures that were independent, but they accepted that there was an understandable perception among the public that they were not truly independent. The key benefit of this legislation is the introduction of the legal services regulatory authority, which is welcomed by everybody. I just do not understand the narrative that was presented in the media. Far be it from me to defend the current Minister for Justice and Equality, but I do not accept the narrative. She listened to reasoned arguments and addressed them, and that is what we want the Government to do. The Opposition's job is to hold Government to account. When it comes to legislation, our job is to engage with the relevant stakeholders. For example, we have serious criticisms of the International Protection Bill. My party has met with all the NGOs working on issues relating to refugees and asylum seekers, as, I am sure, Fianna Fáil and others have. We have listened to their concerns and submitted amendments. That is what parties do in a democracy if they agree with the concerns raised. They try to hold Government to account and to strengthen the legislation and change it. That is what is done in the normal run of things. What has happened here is that we in the Opposition have listened to reasoned arguments from key stakeholders, people who have been dealing with complaints from citizens around legal services for many years and who made solid recommendations for amendments, and we submitted them. I am glad to see that the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, and the current Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her Department officials, have listened to those concerns. They have agreed that many of these concerns are sensible and that there is a need for change, and they have made this Bill better. I do not have any major criticism of the change in direction from the original Bill to what it is now. I have concerns about multidisciplinary practices. They have been presented as a panacea, as a huge cost-saving intervention, and as radical reform of the way we do law in this State. The concern internationally has been that these multidisciplinary practices sucked the talents that were there, took them into the one building, where there are solicitors, barristers and accountants, all hired by the wealthiest companies and corporations and retained by them, and that we would not have a level playing pitch. I am thinking here in an Irish context of citizens in places like Donegal, Limerick and Cork, rural areas where people go to their local solicitor to hire the services of a learned counsel who is specialised in a given area. They might find the best and brightest are under one building, hired by a corporation the client might have to take on. We did not see the benefit of that. The free legal advice centres also had serious criticism of this proposal. I do not think anybody could accuse them of being a vested interest or of protecting the old ways. There were, therefore, considerable concerns about multidisciplinary practices, and we make no apologies for raising them again and again. There is need for reform within the legal fraternity that is not dealt with in this Bill. People from less privileged backgrounds will struggle to make their way through as barristers. The whole devilling system needs to change. We need to have access for people from working class and other communities in this State to work their way through. This is a really important, fundamental issue because our Judiciary is populated from those ranks. If we have a Judiciary that is from the wealthier, more privileged parts of our society, which may hold views that are more conservative than the average citizen, or may have an experience of life that does not reflect the experiences of most citizens, when these people are tasked with interpreting our Constitution in the Supreme Court at the highest level of the Judiciary, that is worrying. We need a Supreme Court that is populated not just by people learned in the law, but people who have experience, who understand the experiences of citizens, who understand the need for change, and who have a real-life approach to the people who find themselves in front of them in courtrooms across the land. These are real issues and there is much more work to be done than is addressed in this Bill. I will conclude by reaffirming the following points. The key issue for most citizens who find themselves having to engage with legal services is cost. They find themselves with huge bills that add to the distress they already face. This Bill does not go far enough to address that key issue. That should have been the key challenge of the Bill. The independent legal regulatory authority is welcomed universally. It is important to reassure citizens who have had a bad experience with somebody in the legal fraternity that they have an independent avenue to go to that is beyond reproach. It is too late for this Government, but whoever is in place in the next Government needs to take the mediation Bill down off the shelf, dust it off, engage with the stakeholders, and task the incoming Oireachtas justice committee with holding hearings, because that Bill, which will probably need more amendments and strengthening, has the potential to make a real impact for citizens and to change the culture. People instinctively go to a solicitor - it is their first port of call and they do not have the culture of mediation in mind - but imagine a situation where the solicitor is obliged to advise them that they should avail of mediation and a judge would be able to say: ""Folks, why are you before me? These issues can be resolved by mediation. Go away and try to resolve them, then come back."" If we get to that point, that will make the biggest contribution to a more thoughtful and reasoned approach to resolving disputes in this State and it would be much less costly. That would be in the best interest of citizens. I have read all of the media analysis, throughout various publications, and they have missed the point. The point is not this idea of a reforming Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, being undermined by a Minister caving in, which is not correct. The point is that this Bill has not achieved for citizens what it could have achieved. There is hardly any reference to the mediation Bill. Those journalists have an important role in our democracy, in looking at legislation, observing matters in this Oireachtas and looking at who lobbies for changes in legislation. I ask them to go back and look at what has happened with this legislation - to really look at it, not just have an almost lazy analysis. They should go back and look at the facts of what has happened throughout this process. They should look at the recommendations, at what we have ended up with, and the points of view of both sides. On multidisciplinary practices, they should listen to the point of view of the main advocate, the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, and others, and listen to the view of the free legal advice centres, of the Opposition and of critics of that proposal internationally. They should listen to all points of view before they start to write their articles. I was taken aback by the universal analysis, across the media, by journalists I respect.Talented, intelligent and capable journalists got this wrong. They missed the key point for the people they are speaking to out there, which is around costs, that this Bill missed. Hopefully, we can reflect on this matter. We are coming to the conclusion of this Bill. It is welcome that we finally got it over the line, but the next Government needs to bring in real reform."	spk_98
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-09	dail	31	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_18	Communities in various parts of the State have been devastated in the wake of Storm Desmond with extensive flooding to homes and businesses. Earlier this morning, I read yesterday's transcript, which showed that 17 Government and Opposition Deputies from across the State raised the concerns of their communities in counties Westmeath, Roscommon, Cork, Kerry, Laois, Clare, Galway, Mayo and Donegal. With respect, the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, will have to visit more than just Bandon. There are many counties and communities to be visited during the coming weeks. Despite the increased risk and frequency of flooding in recent years, the Government is not taking it seriously. In the 2016 budget, the Government cut the OPW's risk management programme by 25%, or €15.6 million. Although the Government's PR machine has been out talking about €15 million in flood relief, €10 million of it was already there. Only €5 million is new money, although the Government has cut €15.6 million from the programme for this year. We have asked the Taoiseach several times whether the Government would introduce a special State-funded package for householders and businesses in areas of high flood risk but who, through no fault of their own, cannot obtain insurance. Will he address it? The Taoiseach avoided answering Deputy Martin's question on it. Will the Taoiseach examine the issue of the OPW's risk management programme and put resources into it again? Will he ensure it has the resources and energy to fast-track the programmes? It has been there since 2011, almost five years. Will the Taoiseach send a message to the communities in the west about the Government's plan regarding insurance and addressing the cutbacks in next year's budget?	spk_143

Nobody has a monopoly on concern about this issue that affects communities across the west. The Deputies pointed out practical issues regarding the maintenance and cleaning of rivers and issues around CFRAM's flood risk management. The Taoiseach is very familiar with County Donegal. While Deputies spoke about flooding for the second time in six years, people in the Finn Valley area, south Donegal and west Donegal had flooding for the second time in weeks. Businesses, community centres and homes that had cleared out the damage from the previous flood a few weeks ago, in very traumatic circumstances, were back at it again. They thought they might have had amelioration measures in place. Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful. While all of us in the Houses are concerned, unfortunately, what we are doing is not working. Will the Taoiseach address in a real, tangible way the issue of homes that cannot get insurance? Will he ensure there are resources around flood risk assessment plans to reassure businesses and communities that the resources will be fast tracked to the OPW? Excellent issues, such as the maintenance of rivers, were raised. The Taoiseach should read through the transcripts of the contributions by all Deputies yesterday, Government and Opposition. They are at the front line speaking to the heroic people who worked in our emergency services, Defence Forces, local authorities and communities and got the proposals to put to the Taoiseach. I know the Minister of State will read the transcripts and take on board the issues that were raised.Can we send a collective message to those citizens from these Houses that such issues will be addressed as best we can within our powers?	spk_154

The Bill is due to be debated on Second Stage in the House tomorrow. Will the Government withdraw the Bill and take on board the serious concerns of the respected NGOs that work with refugees and asylum seekers? Second, the ""RTE Investigates"" programme has had a hell of a run, but let us not forget its fantastic exposé of the criminal gangs that control prostitution throughout the island.

This Government has repeatedly introduced legislation in a matter of weeks, with some Bills going through all Stages in a single day, but legislation that would empower and protect people with disabilities and give them tangible and clearly defined rights has not been enacted. I note what the Minister of State said about enthusiasm and energy. In fairness, the current Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality have been in office for just over a year and a half. However, collectively, this Government has failed to address this issue. There are only a few months left in this Government's term and I do not understand why we cannot proceed to ratify the aforementioned convention. What is objectionable within the convention? Why can we not ratify it? Is it a case of civil servants, yet again, in the ear of the Minister of State saying that there may be unknown or unforeseen consequences and urging caution instead of proceeding and doing what is right?

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-01	dail	31	Independent Review Mechanism	dbsect_3	My core criticism still stands. The five-year term of this Government is now almost complete. A range of legislation has been drafted, identified as a Government priority and pushed through ahead of recesses and, sometimes, pushed through all Stages on the one day. We are not going to resolve this by arguing here today. What needs to be agreed by all parties, on all sides of these Houses, is that in the term of the next Government, whatever its make-up, we collectively commit to ratification of this convention and to addressing the legislative issues, and that we give that commitment to people with disabilities and their families, as well as the disability NGOs. As the Minister of State can probably guess, it is the disability NGOs that are demanding the meetings with the political parties. They are saying that we in these Houses have failed to address these matters and, ultimately, this Government has failed. I am not saying the Minister of State or his senior colleague care less about people with disabilities than I do. However, we have to accept there has been a failure in this Government term and it cannot happen again in the term of the next Government. We cannot make people with disabilities a second, third or fourth priority. They need to go to the top of the priority list the next time.	spk_11

I have met some of the families and the cases are appalling. I have five or six cases here but I was struck by a new one that came to me yesterday. Other Members would have received the letter too. The family's comment says it all. They were utterly dismayed at the review. No one spoke to them, no one asked them for any information and they know from a query to a named body that the files were not requested from the panel. How can the Minister stand over a review mechanism that does not even talk to the people concerned, does not ask for more clarification or documentation and does not go to the body concerned to read the original files and make a recommendation to her?How can Members of these Houses stand over this process and call it an independent review to deal with the scale of concerns some of these families have about appalling experiences? I ask the Minister to stand over what the correspondent wrote, namely, that no one had spoken to the family and that no one had asked them for any information. Moreover, no one has approached the agency and looked for the case files, yet the panel made a recommendation to the Minister and she stands over it.	spk_28

I find it unbelievable Members of the Oireachtas are being asked to stand over an independent review mechanism that does not speak to the people who make allegations, does not seek further information and does not visit the bodies about which allegations sometimes are made to seek access to files. How can this be a review over which Members of these Houses can stand? To be clear, I have stated many times that the vast majority of the men and women of An Garda Síochána during the years have been of the highest standing, that is, they have been wonderful people who have served the State. However, a tiny minority have been a disgrace to it and when people have and abuse power, the consequences can be devastating for families. It is alleged that members of An Garda Síochána colluded in the murder of people's loved ones, covered up and did not properly investigate, with devastating consequences for the families concerned. They had hope that, at last, the wall of bureaucracy would come down and that this process could start to get answers for them and put serious pressure on those who had abused their power. Instead, there was another layer of bricks on that wall of bureaucracy. They are devastated by their experience of the review panel which has been a failure for the cohort of cases that are genuine. The process might have cleared out a pile of cases that were not genuine; that is fine and let those cases be cleared out. However, there is a cohort of serious cases in which citizens of the State were abused and failed by some in power who were a disgrace to the uniform.	spk_32

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-01	dail	31	UN Conventions Ratification	dbsect_5	Prior to the last election five years ago, the then leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, Deputies Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore were asked what their priority issue was and both said it was rights for people with disabilities, particularly the rights of families of children with special needs. This Government has repeatedly introduced legislation in a matter of weeks, with some Bills going through all Stages in a single day, but legislation that would empower and protect people with disabilities and give them tangible and clearly defined rights has not been enacted. I note what the Minister of State said about enthusiasm and energy. In fairness, the current Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality have been in office for just over a year and a half. However, collectively, this Government has failed to address this issue. There are only a few months left in this Government's term and I do not understand why we cannot proceed to ratify the aforementioned convention. What is objectionable within the convention? Why can we not ratify it? Is it a case of civil servants, yet again, in the ear of the Minister of State saying that there may be unknown or unforeseen consequences and urging caution instead of proceeding and doing what is right? This should have been done many years ago.	spk_9
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-01	dail	31	UN Conventions Ratification	dbsect_5	My core criticism still stands. The five-year term of this Government is now almost complete. A range of legislation has been drafted, identified as a Government priority and pushed through ahead of recesses and, sometimes, pushed through all Stages on the one day. We are not going to resolve this by arguing here today. What needs to be agreed by all parties, on all sides of these Houses, is that in the term of the next Government, whatever its make-up, we collectively commit to ratification of this convention and to addressing the legislative issues, and that we give that commitment to people with disabilities and their families, as well as the disability NGOs. As the Minister of State can probably guess, it is the disability NGOs that are demanding the meetings with the political parties. They are saying that we in these Houses have failed to address these matters and, ultimately, this Government has failed. I am not saying the Minister of State or his senior colleague care less about people with disabilities than I do. However, we have to accept there has been a failure in this Government term and it cannot happen again in the term of the next Government. We cannot make people with disabilities a second, third or fourth priority. They need to go to the top of the priority list the next time.	spk_11

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-01	dail	31	Independent Review Mechanism	dbsect_8	I have no doubt that many of the 320 complaints were not valid but a significant number are. I have met some of the families and the cases are appalling. I have five or six cases here but I was struck by a new one that came to me yesterday. Other Members would have received the letter too. The family's comment says it all. They were utterly dismayed at the review. No one spoke to them, no one asked them for any information and they know from a query to a named body that the files were not requested from the panel. How can the Minister stand over a review mechanism that does not even talk to the people concerned, does not ask for more clarification or documentation and does not go to the body concerned to read the original files and make a recommendation to her?How can Members of these Houses stand over this process and call it an independent review to deal with the scale of concerns some of these families have about appalling experiences? I ask the Minister to stand over what the correspondent wrote, namely, that no one had spoken to the family and that no one had asked them for any information. Moreover, no one has approached the agency and looked for the case files, yet the panel made a recommendation to the Minister and she stands over it.	spk_28
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-01	dail	31	Independent Review Mechanism	dbsect_8	When this process commenced, I had hopes for it, but I have no confidence in it now. I find it unbelievable Members of the Oireachtas are being asked to stand over an independent review mechanism that does not speak to the people who make allegations, does not seek further information and does not visit the bodies about which allegations sometimes are made to seek access to files. How can this be a review over which Members of these Houses can stand? To be clear, I have stated many times that the vast majority of the men and women of An Garda Síochána during the years have been of the highest standing, that is, they have been wonderful people who have served the State. However, a tiny minority have been a disgrace to it and when people have and abuse power, the consequences can be devastating for families. It is alleged that members of An Garda Síochána colluded in the murder of people's loved ones, covered up and did not properly investigate, with devastating consequences for the families concerned. They had hope that, at last, the wall of bureaucracy would come down and that this process could start to get answers for them and put serious pressure on those who had abused their power. Instead, there was another layer of bricks on that wall of bureaucracy. They are devastated by their experience of the review panel which has been a failure for the cohort of cases that are genuine. The process might have cleared out a pile of cases that were not genuine; that is fine and let those cases be cleared out. However, there is a cohort of serious cases in which citizens of the State were abused and failed by some in power who were a disgrace to the uniform.	spk_32

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-12-01	dail	31	Garda Operations	dbsect_9	That is a remarkable response. The Minister should think about what a sentencing council is. The majority of members on the sentencing council in England and Wales are members of the judiciary and that protects the independence of the judiciary. They consult the public and stakeholders and issue guidelines so that every judge - in this State that would be the District and Circuit Courts up to the Supreme Court but, in particular, the District and Circuit Courts - is clear that he or she is accountable for the decision he or she makes in regard to the category of offence before him or her. We can think about some of the sentences handed out to people guilty of very grievous sexual offences in this State in recent years and of the insult that was to the victims, first and foremost, and to women who were horrified by what had happened.The Government has not introduced a judicial council Bill or dealt with the issue of the appointment of members of the Judiciary, even though it has promised to do so time and again. The Minister has said that, in the context of a sentencing council model, the Judiciary is independent. It is calling for a judicial council Bill. The Chief Justice, Ms Susan Denham, has called for it, yet the Government will not introduce it. Clearly, during its five-year term the council has been de-prioritised.

Sinn Féin welcomes in particular the move to end discrimination with regard to rent supplement and the restrictions placed on interpreting of section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998. As for the amendment of section 37 of the Act of 1998, Sinn Féin welcomes the attempt to ensure the language of the Bill establishes that what happens in somebody's private life cannot be used by religious-run workplaces to exploit any exemption to discrimination law in regard to undermining the ethos of that workplace. I listened to a number of previous speakers who outlined examples of the impact of this ongoing injustice, and I welcome this legislation to bring an end to it. On foot of the passing of the marriage referendum, a number of matters are of powerful importance to the LGBT community. Hopefully, it will remove homophobia from the classroom and workplace and will prevent the chilling effect mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, in introducing this debate. In addition, as the Minister of State is aware, the work for equality continues for the LGBT community and organisations such as GLEN must be resourced. It is necessary to embolden and embed the progress made and it is necessary to be able to support in the schools young people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual. Members must ensure there is no toleration for prejudice and there is no doubt but that a significant minority of people here still hold a degree of prejudice towards the LGBT community. Consequently, the work continues and organisations that work for LGBT equality must be provided with resources. This is an issue I will raise with the Minister of State in greater detail at a separate time. However, the work of equality continues and great progress has been made. I commend the Minister of State on this Bill and commend the Government on the marriage equality referendum. I also commend the Yes Equality campaign on the campaigning on the ground but while significant progress has been made, which must be welcomed, there is more to be done. On the question of rent supplement, I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has taken the opportunity afforded by this miscellaneous Bill to deal with this important issue. One cannot tolerate what is happening across the State, whereby landlords are refusing tenants who must rely on rent supplement. That is not a republic or a state that has solidarity for all people. Members cannot tolerate it. Again, I welcome the provision in respect of discrimination in the advertising of jobs and it is right and welcome that the individual concerned should be able to make the complaint, rather than the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC. As for the retirement age issues, while Sinn Féin also welcomes the amendments, although there may be some challenges in that some employers may be reluctant to offer fixed-term contracts. Nevertheless, Sinn Féin supports it because it is the right thing to do and must be addressed. This brings me to a huge issue because when one speaks of equality, this subject goes to the core. Most parliamentarians in these Houses regard themselves as republicans and adhere to the principles of equality. This means the issue of equality for disabled citizens must be addressed. While I rightly give credit to the Government on a range of issues, particularly LGBT equality, and in respect of the Minister of State's own campaigning on the issue of Travellers' rights equality, more must be done on disability rights. At present, 600,000 people with a disability live in this State. In the Six Counties, the rights of persons with disabilities have been recognised since 2008 on foot of ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, a man in Dundalk is not treated in the same equitable fashion as his sister in Newry, as she has the full protection of the convention. While there are some difficulties with the administration of the aforementioned convention, an oversight body is working actively with Members' colleagues in the Six Counties on ways to improve its application. In the Six Counties, the convention operates, rights are clear and the task is to apply those rights and hold to task employers and State agencies for failing to uphold clear enumerated obligations. By contrast, citizens in this State with disabilities who reside in this jurisdiction live in an uncertain situation. The most they can do to clarify their particular situation is to consult the roadmap to ratification of the convention issued by the Minister of State's Department. I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is responsible for this area but as the Minister of State is aware, a number of Bills are before the House at present that seek to bring the Irish Legislature into accordance with the requirements of the convention. It is the Minister's argument that such legislative activity is necessary lest domestic legislation conflicts with the rights provided post-ratification. If one consults that roadmap, with what is a person with disability confronted? A small selection of actions illustrates the uncertainty. The roadmap declares it is intended to amend the Companies Act 2014 by the end of this year and it is expected that the mental health Bill will be published in 2016.In relation to Article 27(a), in respect of which a reservation As the Minister of State knows, the Good Friday Agreement officially acknowledged that the constitutional and other legal arrangements of the day were not sufficiently adequate to protect all human rights of the Irish people in both jurisdictions. Although the Government has said it agrees with what the convention outlines, it has not, during its almost five years in power, agreed to do what is outlined therein. Similarly, the previous Government negated to tackle the issue and honour its international obligations. I recognise that positive work has been done in regard to certain sectors of our citizenship but the rights of people with disabilities are not a priority for this Government nor were they a priority of the previous Government. In practice, the rights of people with disabilities must still be fought for given the uncertainty generated by non-ratification of the convention. Case law has outlined obligations that may arise by virtue of the EU ratification of the convention but, unfortunately, these obligations will not be clear until ratification is complete. In the meantime it may take a disabled citizen to embark on a personal action through the court system to claim those rights with which the Government has already said it agrees. This means the detail and extent of rights applicable to persons with disabilities is under judicial control, subject to judicial discretion and reliant on the advocacy of differing counsel. This may be fine for legal analysts and the lawyering profession but it is not great for the wider Irish citizenship. What is needed is a comprehensive outline of the rights available to persons with disabilities. Citizens need to know and clearly understand their rights and not have to guess, or take a chance in a court action, to find out what they are. They should not need specialised legal knowledge and expertise to interpret the basic meaning of provisions. I will condense my final points at this stage as I am conscious Deputy Clare Daly is waiting to make a contribution. We will commemorate the 100th anniversary of 1916 next year. Based on the manner in which we implement our responsibilities in this area, were Sean Mac Diarmada, a man with disabilities, alive today he would not be treated as equally on this island as were his cousins in Fermanagh. We need to do more on disability rights. This is a major issue that needs to be addressed. The provisions provided for in this legislation are positive and I support and commend them.	spk_546

I am not sure if it is the only one, but it is one of the few police services in the world that retains security and policing responsibilities. To compare it with the North is not to make an exact comparison. There are a number of intelligence agencies, including MI5 and MI6, that operate internally and externally from Whitehall and on the banks of the Thames. One of our concerns in this State has been to separate politics from policing as much as we can. We want the police to become a police service with genuinely independent oversight rather than a police force. We want an independent member of the Judiciary who can look at the definition of ""security"" in the Act, which at least is there and as such is welcome albeit we have some disagreements on it, and adjudicate as recommended by the Chief Justice. This is not a Sinn Féin proposal. It was Mr. Conor Brady who planted the seed for me. It is an eminently sensible proposal and a good and acceptable solution. Nobody would challenge the independence of a judge and, on most occasions, my guess is that the independent member of the Judiciary would agree with An Garda Síochána's assessment. That is my guess and, as such, I do not see the problem. Historically, the Department of Justice and Equality has failed, as proven in the recent report, substantially in its oversight role. Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister and the Department have failed to fulfil the responsibilities of their oversight of An Garda Síochána, they wish to retain that function. I am disappointed that the Minister was there that day in the company of Mr. Conor Brady and Dr. Vicky Conway, two people who are very respected for their analysis of the changes required, but takes this view. While the Garda Commissioner gave an impressive presentation yesterday, that presentation is undermined by the politicians and departmental officials who insist on retaining control. I do not see any viable reason for the Government to refuse to accept the amendment which is based on an idea put forward by Conor Brady. Everyone in the room thought it was a good idea, including the Law Society, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and even the Minister. Obviously, someone in the Department got in her ear and said ""You don't want to let this happen"". That is not the change we need."	spk_73

I imagine this will take considerable time. The first group of amendments I wish to speak to are amendments Nos. 9 to 13, inclusive and 15 to 21, inclusive. These amendments are in line with the need for the authority to be truly independent. The Minister should not be permitted to appoint the Garda Commissioner. The role of the authority under this Bill in recommending the appointment is not strong enough and there should be an amendment to allow for the authority to appoint the Garda Commissioner directly. If the Garda Commissioner is going to be accountable to the authority, the latter must have effective powers and mechanisms to oversee the appointment and removal of the Garda Commissioner. These amendments would correct the Bill and achieve that objective. The next set of amendments includes amendments Nos. 23 to 35, inclusive. In line with the need for the authority to be truly independent, the Minister should not be permitted to appoint the deputy Garda commissioner. The role of the authority under this Bill in recommending the appointment is not strong enough. This should be amended to allow for the authority to directly appoint a deputy Garda commissioner. A deputy Garda commissioner will be accountable to the Garda Commissioner who is accountable to the authority. The authority needs to have effective powers and mechanisms to oversee the appointment and removal of the deputy Garda commissioners. The next set of amendments includes amendments Nos. 37 to 62, inclusive. These amendments relate to the need for the authority to have the power to appoint directly and remove ranks from superintendent up. The Bill must be amended to reflect this. Our objective is that the authority would oversee every promotion and appointment in An Garda Síochána, from sergeant right through to Garda Commissioner. Right now, there is a view among members of An Garda Síochána that many promotions over the years were not down to meritocracy but rather who one knew. That is not to slight every officer promoted, as there are many fine senior officers in An Garda Síochána. That is a perception we must remove by putting in place oversight that is clearly independent and based on a meritocracy. In a football team, if a player is picked based on performance, the entire team has belief and it is better for everybody. If it is felt that somebody has not been appointed under a meritocracy, there is an impact on the morale. That applies in the police service and, more important, the service delivered to the public, so we must deal with that. I will speak to amendment No. 62 which relates to the current provision allowing the Minister to hold, initiate and oversee inquiries on policing matters. That must be amended to give this power to the authority. Amendments No. 70 to 73, inclusive, are technical amendments in line with the new provisions relating to the removal of officers. The basis of amendment No. 76 is to amend the Bill to provide that the Minister's consent is not required for appointment of civilian Garda staff and to give oversight to the authority in this regard. There is a list of all the powers retained by either the Minister or the Government over policing. The temptation might be to justify these individually but consideration of the totality of this crucial list indicates the scale of control that remains centrally vested. For example, the Garda Commissioner and deputy Garda commissioner will be appointed and removed by the Government. The Garda Commissioner is accountable to the Government and it has been stated that the Garda Commissioner will remain accountable to the Government on matters of national security, but that is not accurate. The original provision on accountability is not altered. The Garda Commissioner will remain accountable to the Minister for the performance of the Garda Commissioner's functions and those of An Garda Síochána. This concerns all aspects of policing and not just national security. Policing plans, strategies and priorities must be confirmed by the Government according to the Bill and security priorities will be set by the Government. The budget is also set by the Government. The Minister may demand any documents of An Garda Síochána and issue written directives to An Garda Síochána and the authority. Closed circuit television schemes must be approved by the Minister and ministerial consent is required for the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to investigate the Garda Commissioner. The Minister decides the number of senior rank positions and consents to the number of civilian staff, the appointment of members to the audit committee and the appointment of the chief executive officer of the authority. The Minister decides what constitutes State security. Government consent is required for gardaí to work with a police service in another state and the Minister authorises delegation of the Garda Commissioner's functions to the deputy Garda Commissioner. The Minister may appoint a person to inquire into any aspect of policing, and statistical information on crime compiled by An Garda Síochána is to go to the Minister and not the authority. Members can see that a serious set of powers is retained by the Government through the Minister. We hoped the amendments from the Opposition could be engaged with but instead, for the fourth day in a row, that will not happen. I have been justice spokesperson for three years now and I was foreign affairs spokesperson for my party before that, but I have never seen a case where there were two days of Committee Stage debate and two days of Report Stage debate with the Minister absent for all of them. I say this with all due respect to the Minister of State present. We have seen two Ministers of State, one of whom is loosely attached to the justice portfolio, but the Minister of State present has no attachment to justice. It is outrageous that this happens when Opposition justice spokespersons have engaged in good faith and rightly have put much work into this Bill because it is of immense importance. This is one of the important planks mentioned by the Government in the reform of An Garda Síochána arising from the various scandals going back to the Morris tribunal. This is big stuff but we have not had a Minister before us. Do not give us the guff that the Minister is doing important business. She has been doing so over recent days but we did not set the schedule, because the Government does that. It is-----	spk_433

That is fair enough.I have made my point. It is unprecedented and outrageous. Many Ministers receive amendments. We put a huge amount of work into our amendments and we engaged through all of it. Unfortunately we were disadvantaged by the fact that the justice committee was scheduled for a date and time at which all the Opposition made clear we could not make it. The committee still went ahead with only Government members present and the amendments we could not move that day have not been allowed on Report Stage. The way the Opposition has been treated in respect of this legislation since Second Stage is unprecedented and outrageous. That is why we are going to call a vote on every single amendment and take as long as we can to get this Bill through until the Minister comes back next week and engages with us seriously. It is an insult how we have been treated regarding this. It is also an insult to the many fine people who have been making submissions to the justice committee, who have attended various seminars and given their expert opinion. It is not just us, as Opposition spokespersons, but also those outside who have given their contributions. That is my contribution. I appreciate the Acting Chairman's intervention and his guidance is accepted.	spk_439
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-11-12	dail	31	Garda Síochána (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015: Report Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_33	I would add that gardaí themselves, through the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, have stated repeatedly that they want politics removed from policing. It is not only the public who wants this following the episodes and the failure of the Department of Justice and Equality and Ministers to oversee An Garda Síochána adequately. Gardaí themselves want this. It has not been a good period for the Attorney General. In terms of the advice given in this matter, one may interpret that the Government has an executive responsibility in terms of security matters but to stretch it to all policing matters is an interesting interpretation of the Constitution. An examination of the legal status of both individual gardaí and the Commissioner presents problems with fulfilling their functions within Article 28. Gardaí have wide and discretionary powers to interfere with constitutional rights and they cannot be directed when and how to use those powers. The function of the Commissioner is defined as directing and controlling An Garda Síochána and advising the Minister on policing and security matters. Ministers have repeatedly declined to accept responsibility for decisions of the Commissioner as policies and practices are for the Commissioner to decide. The Minister's role is to hold the Commissioner to account for performing these functions, not to have a hand in how they perform them. Given the legal status of the Commissioner, the Minister and individual gardaí, it is difficult to conclude that policing is an executive function. I would like to see the Attorney General's advice in this matter. Whatever argument one can make about security matters, and we need a separate policing and security apparatus in this State given that we have a unique situation where they are combined, it is a remarkable interpretation of the Constitution to stretch it to all policing matters as an executive function of Government. Few academic legal experts, certainly, in the policing arena, would agree with that assessment. It is remarkable. As Deputy Clare Daly stated, if the Minister was determined to separate politics and government from policing and this was her advice from the Attorney General, why did she not put this to a referendum? The Government has held referendums on much less important matters in recent years.	spk_443

The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, presided over the first sitting. The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, presided over the second sitting which was unfortunately and disappointingly scheduled at a time and date when it could not be attended by any of the Opposition justice spokespeople who take questions. The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, did not attend either meeting and she is absent again today. It is outrageous that the Minister for Justice and Equality has missed two separate Committee Stage sittings and today's Report Stage debate. It shows a complete disrespect for the Opposition. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, when I say that. I appreciate that he is doing his job. This is supposedly a major Bill for the Government. It certainly should be a major Bill for the people. We did not have the Minister for Justice and Equality for Committee Stage and now we do not have her for Report Stage. I want to put it on the record that it is outrageous that this has happened. I am very disappointed that our amendments have been ruled out of order. I do not tend to get into quarrels with the Bills Office which is very professional. I am disappointed because all the Opposition spokespeople attended the first day of the Committee Stage debate and tabled many amendments. When the Committee Stage proceedings went into a second day, the meeting was scheduled at a time and date that did not suit any of the Opposition Deputies for what I hope are very understandable reasons. Deputy Wallace and I were led to believe that because we had discussed our interlinked amendments in such detail on the day, there was an understanding that the amendments we could not discuss during the second half of the Committee Stage debate would be accepted. As Opposition Deputies, we are having to deal with the failure of the Minister for Justice and Equality to show up for two separate days of the Committee Stage debate and for today's Report Stage debate. We are now being asked to accept the decision to rule half of our amendments out of order as a result of the scheduling of one of the days of the Committee Stage debate at a time and date when we could not be present.The Opposition has been treated pretty badly here. I would like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to facilitate me by ensuring every word I have just said and every word the two other Deputies have said is taken on board by the Ceann Comhairle's office and considered as a complaint about what has taken place here.	spk_588

I am very alarmed. When the Minister was in attendance at an event organised by the Law Society and the IHREC, Mr. Conor Brady, a former member of GSOC, made the sensible proposal that whenever something was deemed to be a matter of State security by the Garda when the police authority or GSOC requested information, a way to separate politics from policing, which is what this Bill is supposedly about, and have an independent adjudication would be to have a member of the Judiciary appointed by the Chief Justice, Mrs. Susan Denham, decide on whether it really was a matter of State security. The Bill defines ""State security"", thereby providing the independent member of the Judiciary a legislative footing to decide whether the concern put forward by the Garda Commissioner was valid. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Government will not accept a sensible proposal like Mr. Brady's. I spoke to the Minister briefly as we left the Chamber and I told her that Mr. Brady's suggestion was excellent. She did not disagree but someone in the Department of Justice and Equality got a hold of the proposal and said, ""Ho ho ho"". That is what has happened with this Bill. Departmental officials have decided that they must retain their historical control over policing. The Government will put in place a new policing board, titled ""Independent Policing Authority"", to oversee policing, but the Government will still retain control over the meaty policing issues. That is disappointing. Respected experts on policing in the State, for example, Mr. Brady and Dr. Vicky Conway, were invited by the Department of Justice and Equality, the Law Society and the IHREC to attend the event to which I referred. They gave their opinions but have been ignored by the Department. It is a large, historically conservative Department that has influenced the Minister to make these decisions. That is why votes are being called. This is big stuff. The Bill is a missed opportunity. The Government is undermining the independence of the authority from the get-go. Our party voted to support the Bill on Second Stage in good faith, expecting amendments to be made on Committee and Report Stages. Over the two days that we sat on Committee Stage, the Minister was not present. On Report Stage today, she again was not present. The Government controls the sittings, not us. It is the Minister's choice not to be present. Unfortunately, as the Bill stands, and considering the Minister is not even present to hear the arguments we are making on it, we will be voting against it at the end of Report Stage. This is very much regretted."	spk_598

I point out to him that hundreds of Irish citizens felt it was acceptable to log on to the We support the amendment tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett which strengthens the motion and reflects Deputy Boyd Barrett's commitment to the Traveller community and his partnership with them. However, we will not support the Government's amendment. In reference to the Traveller community we use terms such as ""experience endemic racism and discrimination""; the Government will not use those words. We use words such as ""prejudice"", ""discrimination"" and ""social exclusion""; the Government will not use those words. We state that many Travellers live in ""intolerable substandard living conditions""; the Government will not use those words.We called for an all-Ireland Travellers forum. I wish to read the relevant part of the motion because it is an important contribution in terms of what we seek. We seek to ""establish an all-Ireland forum involving Travellers and the settled community, including representatives of all political parties, central government, local authorities, health and education sectors and representatives of media organisations, to be tasked with"", and we outline the responsibilities it would have. It is an eminently sensible proposal but it has been rejected by the Government. The motion also calls on the State to ""recognise"" Traveller ethnicity. We did not use the word ""grant"" because Travellers are an ethnic minority in the State. They are as Irish as anybody in these Houses and they are a unique part of the fabric of this nation. They have a unique history. It is a unique story that is part of our story and it needs to be recognised. To recognise Traveller ethnicity is not to recognise separateness, it is to be inclusive, to bring them into the embrace, warmth, love and promise of the Republic. That is what it means. We in this Chamber need to recognise the ethnicity of the Traveller people. What we hear in response from the Government is that it will consider it. That is not good enough. It is no longer good enough to consider the matter anymore. The leaders of the Traveller community have called for a new national Traveller accommodation consultative committee or some new agency that will take ownership of the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation throughout the State. Local authorities have failed in this regard. There is a lack of local leadership. We have seen some of that spirit evident in the Chamber tonight. In the absence of local leadership, we need to give responsibility for the issue to a new authority but that call has been rejected. I wish to quote from some of the comments made last night by the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, and Deputy Ciara Conway, both from the Labour Party. It is important to do so. The Minister of State said:I do not accept the premise that we should deal in the terms of popular opinion when advocating the rights of a minority. Outside of a referendum, I do not believe we should deal in focus group equality or that we should rely on polls in regard to how we should proceed on issues of equality. The fact that advocating for the rights of a minority might be unpopular is surely the reason we should collectively strive to ensure that equality is realised.[He continued] As alluded to earlier, since the foundation of this State we have experimented with what may be termed ""sameness"". Sameness is a lie. Since the foundation of this State people with mental health challenges have been incarcerated. Approximately 200,000 people with mental health issues were incarcerated in the 1950s. Young mothers who were unmarried were told that they were wrong and had to be placed in laundries. People who had troubled backgrounds and behavioural difficulties were also told that they were wrong and had to be sent to industrial schools ... Sameness is a lie while diversity is the truth ... The fact that this measure would not be popular, would not do so well in a poll or might be rejected by a focus group is the very reason we have to support it. Let us reject focus group equality.The Minister of State's speech was tremendous and we applaud it. We also note the comments of Deputy Ciara Conway. This is important in terms of her Government colleagues who will vote for the amended Government motion tonight. She said:I have read some of the briefing information I have received from the Department. I could hear the frustration in the voice of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin. It will be noted that he did not read from a script because I am not sure the Department [or indeed his Government colleagues] [are] completely on board with what he had to say.She referred to the briefing note she received in which three steps were outlined. That is a reference to the three simple steps the Oireachtas justice committee agreed on a unanimous, all-party basis for the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality to stand up in this historic Chamber and recognise, on behalf of the State, the ethnicity of the Traveller people. The second step is to write to the international human rights bodies who have demanded this for decades to tell them we have finally done that, and then to work with the Traveller communities on the necessary changes and new dispensation that is required. It is simple stuff. Deputy Conway also stated:Essentially, we are waiting for someone to make a speech and someone else to write a letter, while people's lives hang in the balance. That is simply not good enough. If it involved any other group in society, we would not be waiting for someone to stand up and make a speech and for somebody else to write a letter.These are powerful words. If those Deputies are present, I imagine they will vote with the Government. They will do so even though they have expressed their frustration and anger, in good faith, with their Government colleagues. I will not attack them for that but I will say to those Government colleagues who did not speak in the Chamber, or the likes of Deputy Tom Barry and others, that they need to read what the Minister of State and Deputy Conway said, what we have said and what has been said by various Deputies across the House, namely, that it is time to be on the right side of history. When we first talked about women's rights - the right of women to take seats in parliament, the right of women to go out and work and to receive equal pay - those ideas were unpopular when they were first raised. When we talked about rights for the LGBT community, lesbian and gay citizens, it was not popular. We know that talk of Traveller rights tonight is not popular. That is because for decades there has not been the necessary leadership. We are haunted by the ghost of the 1963 report from the Commission on Itinerancy, one of the most shameful reports in the history of this State, that demonised and criminalised 40,000 Irish citizens - men, women and children - some of whom are here today. That is the stain we must remove. That is the ghost we must take away. We need to have a new beginning. In the seats of the Gallery are the leaders, the men and women of the Traveller community who have spent their lives as second-class citizens in this State and who have been denied the promise of the words of the 1916 Proclamation. During the 100th anniversary next year, let us bring them all back into the Gallery to watch their Taoiseach or Minister for Justice and Equality, whoever that might be, finally, belatedly, recognise their culture, their dignity, their beauty, their humanity, their contribution and their part in our history. That is a day I long for, and we will see it."	spk_581
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-11-03	dail	31	Travellers' Rights: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_29	"During 2013 the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality held a number of hearings on the issue of the State recognising the ethnicity of the Traveller community. In compelling testimony to the committee, Brigid Quilligan, director of the Irish Traveller Movement, stated:Through generations, where we were once a strong, proud people – and for some part still are - we have been devalued within society. Never before in my lifetime have I seen such hate as I have seen in the past five years. If one opens a newspaper or turns on the television, if one is in a shop or on a train, if one looks at Facebook, Twitter, The devastating tragedy at Carrickmines and the response of a significant minority of the people can only have reinforced the deep concern of Brigid and all of the 40,000 men, women and children that make up the Traveller community across the island. The ugly racism of some towards the Traveller community reached a new low after the tragedy at Carrickmines. The fact that hundreds of citizens gave a thumbs-down to expressions of sympathy to victims on the website  How did we get to this point? The first major policy report in the State on Travellers was that of the commission on itinerancy in 1963. The commission was established in June 1960 and the publication of its report three years later established policy on Travellers for the following 20 years. It is one of the most shameful reports in the history of the State. If Members want any evidence of its agenda or views, the four terms of reference for the commission are all that they need to look at. They were: (1) to inquire into the problem arising from the presence in the country of itinerants in considerable numbers; (2) to examine the economic, educational, health and social problems inherent in their way of life; (3) to consider what steps might be taken to provide opportunities for a better way of life for itinerants and to promote their absorption into the general community and, pending such absorption, to reduce to a minimum the disadvantage to themselves and the community resulting from their itinerant habits; and (4) to make recommendations. They were dripping in racism and elitism and everything abhorrent to the 1916 Proclamation. It is ignorant, it is stupid, it is ill-informed, yet it forms the basis for the hatred we see today.I say it again that human beings, citizens of this State, went online and gave a thumbs-down to the expression of sympathy to ten human beings who were burned to death in the most appalling circumstances. The language used in the terms of reference of that report was instructive as to the State’s ideological approach to the Traveller community at that time. It is also instructive that no representatives of the Traveller community sat on the commission. In its report, the commission asserted: Itinerants (or Travellers as they prefer themselves to be called) do not constitute a single homogenous group, tribe or community within the nation although the settled population are inclined to regard them as such. Neither do they constitute a separate ethnic group.It reached this conclusion without any apparent explanation or evidence provided. In its 2013, 50th anniversary review of the Commission on Itinerancy report, the Irish Travellers Movement pointed out that in chapter 6 of the report, the commission states: ""as it was not essential to the consideration of the Commission’s terms of reference, no special study was made of the origins of the itinerant population of this country."" The commission stated that it was aware that “a period of long research” would be needed to answer this question and stated that this was a job for “trained historians”. Despite these acknowledgements, the commission resolutely rejected the ethnicity of Travellers. There was no historical, sociological or anthropological basis; it was just prejudice and racism. That was our society. That is what set the scene for the following decades. That is the virus that infects too many of our citizens in this State when the look at the Traveller community. The approach and recommendations found in the 1963 report of the Commission on Itinerancy remain deeply offensive to Travellers and are largely rejected by modern-day Ireland but the insistence by the State on not recognising the ethnicity of Travellers remains. Following our hearings the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality recommended the following:Step 1:That either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality make a statement to Dáil Éireann confirming that this State recognises the ethnicity of the Travelling community.Step 2:That the Government then writes to the relevant international bodies, confirming that this State recognises the ethnicity of the Travelling community.Step 3:That the Government build on these initiatives and commence a time-limited dialogue with the Traveller representative groups about the new legislation or amendments to existing legislation now required.Tonight's motion calls on the Taoiseach and the Government to implement these recommendations immediately. I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, has been a genuine friend to the Traveller community and a supporter. He was in attendance when we launched the report. I know he is advocating, but it needs to be delivered. I suppose I am not speaking so much to him but to his Government colleagues, to members of the Cabinet and senior departmental officials to do the right thing. I want to outline why our committee made its recommendations. I want to put on record the relevant sections of the report:This State has maintained a position for decades that amounts to ethnicity denial without having presented any evidence-based defence of this position to our international partners and indeed the Travelling community.As part of our committee's deliberations, we examined a number of the excuses or concerns that are there to block this as we could interpret it. They are that it is not in the best interests of Travellers; that granting Traveller ethnicity would be too costly to the State; Traveller ethnicity is not proven; academic reasons; and the need for full consensus amongst Travellers. We examined every one of them and dealt with them through the hearings we held and the visits to the Traveller community in different locations throughout Dublin. We found no legitimacy to any of the concerns. There was a 100% clear case for the recognition of ethnicity. In particular I acknowledge the input of Mr. Laurence Bond of the Equality Authority as it was then. He wrote a comprehensive report entitled Traveller Ethnicity back in the day. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has also written in clear terms about these matters. I leaned heavily on its findings and on the findings of members of the Traveller community who have done superb work. There is an absolutely cast-iron case that there is no justification for delaying this anymore. In response to the first issue, that ""It is not in the best interest of Travellers"", we found that the representatives of the Traveller community are best placed to know what is in their best interests and the support for the recognition of Traveller ethnicity from all four national Traveller organisations and the 99% support of Travellers in attendance at the 2012 conference organised by the National Traveller Monitoring Advisory Committee surely reflects their judgment on the question. Only one Traveller present that day expressed any concern about this matter, which is comprehensive. In response to the issue that ""Granting Traveller ethnicity would be too costly to the State"", the committee pointed out that cost should not be a barrier to the State doing what is right by all its citizens or act as a barrier to justice or equality. However, the committee accepted the analysis of Laurence Bond from the then Equality Authority who advised he could not see any significant additional cost to doing this but that there would be an immense impact of recognising the distinct culture, the contribution of Travellers, their language, their music, of teaching their history to children in schools, of going into community centres with the Traveller community to explain what Traveller culture is and what has its contribution been and why it needs to be cherished and sustained, why we need to have Traveller-specific accommodation, halting sites. It is because we are enriched as a people if we embrace all the diversity of the fabric that makes up our nation. We are only enriched by embracing that, cherishing that and reaching out to some of our most vulnerable citizens and saying, ""You are loved and valued by this Republic"", and then dealing with the issues that exist with any aspect of society. In response to the issue that ""Traveller ethnicity is not proven"", we looked at this issue in terms of the ground-breaking legal cases in Britain and the fact that in the North of Ireland the ethnicity of Travellers is recognised. The only place on these islands that does not recognise the ethnicity, the distinct culture and contribution of our Travellers, is this State. We need to throw that report from the Commission on Itinerancy into the fire or the bin. We need to bury the ghost of that report and start to heal the wounds that have been there in the decades that followed its publication. We have comprehensive evidence of the legal basis in Britain and the North of Ireland for the recognition of ethnicity. In response to the issue of ""Academic reasons"", the committee leaned heavily on the report by Mr. Laurence Bond. I cannot mention him and the Equality Authority enough. It was a superb analysis of the sociological and anthropological case. It was an immense contribution to the debate. In response to the issue of ""The need for full consensus amongst Travellers"", nowhere in the world is it necessary to find 100% consensus. It is up to a person to self-identify his or her race. In every way it was comprehensive.I conclude with the words of Brigid Quilligan. She said:We are not speaking about major changes; we are speaking about people who have been on the island of Ireland for as long as anybody can record and recognition for the valuable contribution we have made to Irish society. We are talking about having our own history recorded, rather than a history that has been written for us, imposed upon us and dictated to us. We are talking about setting the record straight and supporting our people to stand tall and feel they are a valuable part of Irish society.I know the Minister of State is on the right side of history. We just need to get his Cabinet colleagues over the line. We then need to deal with all the other issues my colleagues will mention, including the resourcing of Traveller accommodation; the need for one national body to oversee Traveller-specific accommodation because local authorities have failed."	spk_277

There are some concerns and, in fairness to her, the Minister of State continues to engage with a number of NGOs around them. I will revisit those later as we go through the amendments. I appreciate that the Minister of State has submitted a substantial number of amendments on Committee and Report Stages and is clearly engaging with the concerns people have. That said, concerns remain. The Bill will also go through the Seanad and I ask that the Minister of State consider again in the Seanad whatever emerges on Report Stage here.

In fairness to the Minister of State, I acknowledge that she very much respects that. It is notable that on Committee and Report Stages, there have been significant numbers of amendments from the Minister of State and, as such, the legislation is a work in progress. The Minister of State is right that we need to get the Bill over the line now. I would like to see that happen too. Before we go to the Seanad, I ask the Minister of State to engage to ensure that the NGOs and the centre at NUIG are satisfied that the legislation complies with the UN convention.

I had to take an urgent call and I ask the Minister of State to consider the principle of the amendment in the Seanad. I am speaking on amendments Nos. 66 and 69. Amendment No. 66 relates to what Deputy O'Dowd said. The issue of restraint of relevant persons is addressed by a reference to restrictions on decision-making representatives in previous sections of the Bill. We consider it imperative that the provisions permitting restraint of a person by a decision-making representative should be strictly construed and should explicitly require that the decision-making representative acts in a manner consistent with the principles of the Bill. The provisions should only allow restraint where this is the least restrictive measure to prevent harm. We consider that the definition of restraint as provided in previous sections should be extended and we consider it necessary that a specific provision be included in the section dealing with informal decision-making. We have dealt with this, and amendment No. 69 is similar.	spk_178

We consider that patients in approved centres should have the same rights as others to avail of assisted decision-making in respect of day-to-day decisions. We consider that the Bill should contain a clear statement that it applies in full to all patients in approved centres, save in so far as section 104 applies to any such patient. The inclusion of an express statement to this effect will ensure that the benefits of the legislation are available to people in approved centres.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-10-14	dail	31	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I trust the Taoiseach will address the investment issues I have raised and also the lack of leadership that has been shown, not only at Government level but also at local level across the State. I have one more request to make of the Taoiseach today. For too long there has been a wall of distrust between the settled and Traveller communities in this State. Yesterday, some local residents in Glenamuck formed a blockade in protest at the plans to rehouse, on an emergency basis, those who have been left homeless by this inferno. It is a depressing spectacle but it reflects the wall of distrust that has been in existence for many years. We need citizens to show compassion and I hope the residents - who are meeting the council today - can facilitate this emergency arrangement. There is a need for education and understanding between the two communities, and that is a two-way process. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality recommended quite some time ago that this State recognise the ethnicity of our Traveller people, something that has been called for by international human rights bodies to which we subscribe. It is time for the State to respect the unique contribution of Traveller communities in terms of their music, their language and their adherence to the ancient nomadic ways. We need to teach their history in our schools and break down the barriers and the walls that exist. It is time for this State to build the bridges of understanding. It is time to build on the solidarity that is there after this horrific tragedy. Will the Taoiseach stand up in this Chamber and recognise the ethnicity of the Traveller people? Will he show the necessary leadership, although it will not just be required by him but by elected representatives across the State? Can we finally address the injustice of the report on itinerancy from the 1960s that perceived this as a dirty problem that had to be swept under the carpet? Can we once and for all be honest about the huge wall of distrust and take down the barriers? Can we recognise their ethnicity and start from there?	spk_76
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-10-14	dail	31	Order of Business	dbsect_3	I have two issues that I wish to raise, the first of which concerns the Stormont House Agreement implementation Bill. As the Taoiseach knows, in the Stormont House Agreement the two Governments agreed to provide for truth recovery mechanisms for the families of victims of the conflict. Specifically, the Government has committed to legislating for an historical investigations unit and the creation of an independent commission for information retrieval. There has been consternation at the draft published by the British Government. Using the pretext of national security, it would give the British Secretary of State the power to block full disclosure. What are the Taoiseach's views on that issue and, more importantly, when will the Government publish a Stormont House Agreement implementation Bill? Why is there no date for implementation of the international treaty to underpin the independent commission for information retrieval? The second issue concerns reformed and consolidated domestic violence legislation and the Istanbul Convention. The tragic events of recent days have focused our minds on this issue. Women's domestic violence groups have been raising the issue of the signing of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, known as the Istanbul Convention. I understand the Government took a decision on it yesterday. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will sign the convention?

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-10-08	dail	31	Sentencing Council Bill 2015: First Stage	dbsect_23	I move: That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to establish a Sentencing Council and to provide for related matters. A Sentencing Council already operates in England and Wales, providing sentencing guidelines to the Judiciary. This has ensured that sentences handed out for criminal offences in their courts are consistent and accountable across the board. Concern has arisen over recent years about the perceived inconsistency of sentencing in the courts. Of particular concern and controversy have been some sentences handed out for sexual offences. I have examined the Sentencing Council model in place in England and Wales for some time now. It was the Irish Penal Reform Trust which first brought it to the attention of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. They brought over Lord Justice Colman Treacy, who is now the chairman of the Sentencing Council. I believe that this model of consistency and accountability should be introduced in this State. A key strength of the Sentencing Council is that it involves a range of key stakeholders, such as victim support groups, academics, senior police officers, senior parole officers and the wider public, in the process of establishing sentencing guidelines for the Judiciary. As members of the Judiciary are the majority members of the sentencing council and a senior member of the Judiciary chairs the council, they are still central to the process. However, the sentencing guidelines issued ensure that the Judiciary must stick to the range provided for the category of offence before it. They must also clearly indicate why they have sentenced an offender within that range taking into consideration the impact on the victim and the blameworthiness of the offender. This ensures consistency and accountability across the courts system and across the state. Similar to the Sentencing Council for England and Wales, the sentencing council I and my party are proposing for the State would develop sentencing guidelines and monitor their use; assess the impact of guidelines on sentencing practice, and possibly also consider the impact of policy and legislative proposals relating to sentencing when requested by the Government; promote awareness amongst the public regarding the realities of sentencing and publish information regarding sentencing practice in the courts system; consider the impact of sentencing decisions on victims; monitor the application of the guidelines to better predict their effect; and play a greater role in promoting understanding of and increasing public confidence in sentencing in the criminal justice system. I trust that when the Bill finally comes before these Houses the Government can support it, and we can see a much more accountable and consistent approach which still respects the independence of the Judiciary and the separation of powers but gives it a framework which its members will appreciate, considering that they will be at the heart of that process.	spk_309

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-10-08	dail	31	Choice of Court (Hague Convention) Bill 2015 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_30	"Sinn Féin welcomes the Bill. It should ensure that the Hague Convention on choice of court functions smoothly in this jurisdiction. It should increase legal certainty in commercial relationships involving EU and non-EU parties. Party autonomy in a choice of forum promotes business-to-business efficiency by providing certainty and predictability in international transactions. When each party to a private transaction has the same framework within which the agreement will be understood, jurisdictional disputes should be absent, thus providing associated time and efficiency savings. The fact that enforcement of foreign rulings should follow the adoption of this legislation should increase the confidence of parties that undertake international transactions in a commercial setting, at least with states that are party to the convention. Currently, arbitration has a monopoly in international transactions, given the worldwide enforceability of arbitral awards. The potential viability of the court system route provides competition. While large companies may prefer the arbitration route, there is some indication that small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, prefer the traditional judicial route. As such, this Bill is a welcome one for SMEs that trade with partners outside the EU and may encourage those that do not to explore the possibility of doing so. Unfortunately, our country is separated into two jurisdictions. There are a number of actions that this Government could undertake to promote transactions across borders beyond the  The convention mirrors that of the New York convention on arbitration in seeking a stable and predictable environment in which parties might have some predictability as to forum in the event of dispute. Since that convention has been ratified or acceded to by 158 countries, this convention has some way to go. It is important to note that enterprises must become aware of whether their trading partners have acceded to the treaty. The current legal framework is not as extensive as the New York convention. For example, although the US has signed the convention, there may be clashes between state and federal level that impede progress towards ratification. There remains the possibility of parallel proceedings or inconsistent judgments if a non-chosen court determines a choice of court agreement is invalid and a chosen court determines otherwise. The public policy ground for exception under Article 9 of the convention may be open to abuse if the grounds on which a court refuses to recognise a judgment are based on an uncharacteristically wide interpretation of public policy. There are two further problems that I wish to address that touch on the principles underlying the Bill, the first of which is the ongoing reputational damage caused by this and the previous Governments' inaction in implementing the recommendations made by the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics almost 15 years ago. On Monday, our Chief Justice, Ms Justice Susan Denham, observed that the failure to set up a judicial council was affecting the international reputation of the administration of justice in this State. While a judicial council Bill is expected to be published within the current Dáil session, I am worried that it will not take full account of Ms Justice Denham's concerns. The adoption of the Arbitration Act 2010 was specifically geared towards attracting arbitration business to Ireland, particularly Dublin. There is an opportunity to attract legal business to the State via this Bill, but the inaction and glacial response to setting out a judicial code of conduct hampers this. Speaking on the Bill in the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, argued that a ""company may be reluctant to do business with a particular state because it either mistrusts or is unfamiliar with its legal system"". Conversely, a company that trusts a particular court system may be ""emboldened to proceed"". Why would parties seeking legal certainty and confidence in a legal system agree that the Irish courts should be the forum in which a dispute is heard when they cannot be confident in the training that Irish judges receive? They would not. The rational actor will avoid such fora and seek one with a better reputation. Last week, I mentioned that it was the direct decisions of this Government that negatively influenced certain crime figures. Those decisions are damaging the reputation of the legal system and preventing innovative business activity around legal services from taking advantage of the certainty provided by the Hague Convention. Given the reputational damage the Government continues to cause, it is unlikely we can compete with other more advanced and trustworthy states in attracting legal business. My next point is based upon the principles that underlie party autonomy in choice of court. Fundamentally, this is based on the idea that business opportunities can arise on the ground that the players involved in a market are best placed to take advantage of it. As such, they may privately order their relations to mutual advantage while taking account of mandatory law. As long as mandatory law is respected, hurdles should be removed, especially in respect of the neglected SME sector. One of the greatest hurdles confronting Irish SMEs is the continuing operation of partition. The Government should follow the logic of the Hague Convention on choice of court and encourage commercial trade by following the advice in my party's 2014 document on encouraging SMEs. Such advice includes a Border development zone to harmonise trade and maximise returns for Border businesses and the island economy, and a trade forum to bring together SMEs to address common challenges, including finance, logistics and business support, that would make use of local and external expertise. This should include information on the credit appeals process in both jurisdictions, using InterTradeIreland as a facilitator. We must upgrade island-wide infrastructure. This means completing the A5 and the Narrow Water bridge and developing an island-wide rail network. We must ensure the Oireachtas and the Assembly agree a strategy to get credit card and mobile telephone companies to remove the Border from their roaming charge systems and cross-Border administration costs and treat the island as one entity for cost purposes. We must re-examine the regulatory barriers to doing business on the Border. InterTradeIreland has conducted studies on this suggestion and made a number of recommendations, which can be reviewed and implemented. We should remove impediments to businesses when transferring staff North and South by organising direct co-ordination between the relevant Departments, for example, the Revenue Commissioners, to make it easier for employees to work on either side of the Border. In sum, this Bill is a logical solution to the problem of unnecessary and cumbersome cross-border jurisdictional disputes centring on international transactions. It follows the success of the New York convention on arbitration and is to be welcomed. However, the continued inaction on establishing a judicial council and the historical offence of partition act in contradiction to it. Partitionist thinking continues to harm the Irish economy. While I have much respect for the Minister of State's approach to many issues, I was disappointed by his tweet, which he has since removed. As a man with a great fondness for County Monaghan, he should have a sense of the all-Ireland economy."	spk_331

However, I want to acknowledge Deputy McNamara's amendment and the previous amendment. I think the issues that have been raised are valid. In the case of this amendment, it strikes me that same-sex couples will not be able to get married outside a registry office. Therefore, as Deputy Shatter has said, they will be hampered by the current office hours, which will restrict them to getting married between Monday and Friday. Obviously, wider options will be available to couples who are able to get married in religious ceremonies.Clearly there is an issue of equality at play here when one set of couples will not have the same options in terms of the day for getting married and having their receptions on the same day. It is a valid issue and perhaps the Minister would consider it ahead of the Seanad debate. Regarding the issue raised earlier, perhaps further consideration could be given to the points made by Deputy Alan Shatter. We would be concerned about the impact on citizens residing here having the status of their relationships recognised by the State. Is there a possibility of the State having an agreement with other states to recognise the status of those relationships? We would like some feedback on the options available.	spk_162

However, I would like to make a number of comments and outline our ten-point plan, which we offer to the Minister and her senior officials for consideration as part of their deliberations, towards the end of my contribution. This crisis is not a new one. A few years ago, I visited Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, which have been there for decades. They were taking in Palestinians from Syria. In other words, refugees were housing other refugees in appalling conditions. One of the buildings we visited had been bombed out by Israeli forces but refugees were living in it. Our delegation of parliamentarians from Ireland and Britain met officials from the UNHCR and UNRWA to discuss our concerns, which we also raised with EU representatives. This crisis has been going on, therefore, for quite a while. Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey have taken in a huge number of refugees and they have taken on a massive burden in the context of this crisis. The Minister gave assurances that Ireland would ensure the international community would give those states as much support as it can to deal with the crisis. When we talk about stepping up to the plate, it is remarkable what those three states have done. However, other states in the region have not stepped up to the plate, including the wealthy gulf states. We need to confront them morally about their failure in this regard and challenge them. It cannot just be commerce and business as usual with these states. We need to say we are part of a global community and everybody has to step up and do what is right as part of their international obligations. Yesterday, INIS officials and the Refugee Applications Commissioner appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, to which the Minister made reference. They are good people doing their best but it is clear that there is not a definitive plan. They are working their way through what needs to happen, which presents an opportunity. Obviously, we would like full costings and a detailed plan but that will take time over the next number of months. Sinn Féin will submit its own suggestions, which I will address shortly. President Juncker in his state of the Union address referred to a contribution of €6,000 per refugee to states and €500 per refugee for travel and so on. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform rightly said the Government would say to the Union that whatever expenditure is undertaken in this crisis will not be factored into normal budgetary considerations, which would mean it would not have an impact on other decisions the Government makes. I note both these important points. A considerable number of our citizens are wondering about our own housing and unemployment crises and our economic recovery and asking whether they should be addressed first. I strongly believe that we can address both domestic and international obligations but we need to lay out clearly how and why the State can do both. That is absent from the debate currently. I ask the Minister and her senior officials to ensure there is a clearly communicated plan and a clearly communicated message that the Government will deal with these domestic issues but can meet our international obligations and to reassure people before this is turned into a silent resentment or, possibly even worse, racism. It is very important that we co-operate with the non-governmental organisations. There are superb people in those organisations who have tremendous expertise in terms of integration and location at various places throughout the State. We need to involve communities in advance. We need to tell them that there will be X number of refugees and their families moving to their areas and involve them in the process. There are good models. For example, Southill in Limerick was brought to my attention yesterday. I understand there was a relocation of Congolese or African citizens there that worked really well. That is a good model, which I would ask the Minister to examine. That can be done but we need to plan it out and involve non-governmental organisations and thereby have an inclusive process. This State has not opted in to two directives that would have allowed those seeking asylum to work after nine months. That is a reasonable expectation. I think we would all accept that our system has been way too cumbersome and that it has taken too much time to make decisions. I welcome the fact that legislation relating to this matter will be brought forward in the near future, and the sooner the better. We have had people stuck in these direct provision centres for far too long, in some cases for more than ten years. We need to make decisions about people who have been there for that length of time. We should allow them to stay, that is my firm view. As the Minister will be aware, the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions did a good deal of work on this - its members visited the centres and it published a report. We are not happy at all with the direct provision system. It fails our people and does not reflect their values. It needs to go. I do not want the new numbers of refugees who will come here to face similar experiences. We have a bad track record on this, which is out of kilter with the history of the State. As I have said in this Chamber on numerous occasions, ours is the only country in the world that has a smaller population than was the case in the early 1800s. That reflects our history of mass emigration, which has continued right up to recent years. I am a Donegal man. Our history in Donegal has been one of emigration. My father and grandfather emigrated. I emigrated for a short period and was lucky to be able to come home. That has been the history of people from Donegal and the west. It is the history of our country. With that history in mind, surely we can do better on the issue of taking a reasonable and fair allocation of refugees and welcoming them to our country. However, we must do it in a way that deals with the fears - sometimes these are legitimate - of citizens. We can do all of that. I want to outline some of my party's ten-point plan on this issue. Ireland should commit to taking one refugee per every 1,000 of our population. A proposal in this regard was made by the non-governmental organisations and that is one of the figures mentioned in it. In fairness, the 4,000 figure over the two years is in that ballpark. That would see us take in 4,500 to 5,000 people this year. The direction the Government has taken is a good step. We probably can do more but it is certainly very encouraging and it is a good signal. We need to continue this in the next number of years because this crisis is not going to go to away any time soon. We need to develop a national action plan. That plan should be both short-term and long-term focused. The Government should immediately set up a working group, made up of immigration experts. Some of what I am calling for may already be happening. I will set out the points, as we put them forward before these measures were taken. As stated, the Government should establish a working group, made up of immigration experts and civil society groups, to speedily identify the infrastructural requirements and other needs and the logistics necessary to make our response to the crisis as successful as possible. I understand from yesterday's meeting that a fair amount of that is happening. The Government should also engage with the Northern Executive - this is very important - and the British Government to work on a common approach across the island. We call for the immediate implementation and enhancing the Syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme from Britain into the Six Counties. We fully support the use of the Irish Naval Service in search-and-rescue missions in the Mediterranean and the Government's call to ensure that these missions continue. We do not want Ireland to be involved in a EUNAVFOR Med mission or a military-style mission. However, all of our people are immensely proud of the work of our Naval Service and we should continue that work. I have already said that we need to end direction provision system. We call for an emergency summit of member states to be convened immediately. Emergency meetings are ongoing and I ask the Minister to be at the forefront of that process. We call for others to play their part on setting up safe and legal access to Europe. This could be done through a UN Security Council resolution, as well as all European member states working together in a spirit of the Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, to make this happen. This could also include the provision of the issuing of humanitarian visas for those travelling from conflict zones. We must suspend the Dublin regulations to ensure effective access to asylum. The regulations usually mean that the responsible member state will be the state through which the asylum seeker first entered the EU. The Dublin regulations establish a hierarchy of criteria for identifying the member state responsible for the examination of an asylum claim in Europe. This is not practical under the current circumstances. We call on the European Commission and member states to activate the temporary protection directive. Temporary protection is an exceptional measure to provide displaced persons from non-EU countries and unable to return to their country of origin with immediate and temporary protection. It applies in particular when there is a risk that the standard asylum system is struggling to cope with demand stemming from a mass influx that risks having a negative impact on the processing of claims. This directive and its concrete proposals must be immediately activated in light of the current situation. We call on the Commission and member states to stop co-operation with third countries which aim to prevent asylum seekers from reaching a safe place in Europe and we also call for an end of negotiations on any such agreements with third countries, such as Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia and Egypt, that do not guarantee the protection of refugees and respect for fundamental rights. Ireland should opt back in to the common European asylum system, CEAS. As I said, we should opt in to the directives. If we set a challenge that somebody has the right to work after nine months, it will mean that we will get our act together in terms of applications process. We cannot leave people languishing, for more than ten years in some cases, without the ability to work, living on €19 a week. I have visited these direct provision centres in my role as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions. They fail the standard of decency that we set as a State. We cannot allow this to continue and we need to address it. We need to opt in to directives, which will ensure that our State meets the standards that are expected of the European Union. We need to address the root cause of the crisis. We need to strengthen long-term efforts to resolve the root causes of the refugee crisis by advancing political solutions to conflict and inclusive socioeconomic development across Africa and Middle East. Ireland has a proud track record in overseas development aid. We had the highest 	spk_74
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-10-01	dail	31	Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015: Second Stage	dbsect_28	"Sinn Féin supports this Bill. Although my party will support the passage of this legislation, this does not take away from the rise in assaults, sexual offences this year, theft, fraud and burglaries under the current Administration. As the Garda Inspectorate report on crime investigation revealed, the number of such offences may be higher but has been under-represented in Central Statistics Office statistics due to errors in the categorisation of some offences. This is compounded by the Government's closure of so many Garda stations throughout the State, thereby increasing the uncertainty, fear and isolation felt by citizens it is tasked to protect. This results from an austerity agenda that places savings to the Exchequer over the security and safety of the citizens within this State. While the targeting of serial offenders within this Bill is to be welcomed, the structural causes that give rise to the problem of burglaries are a result of the direct decisions made by the Government. Recent CSO statistics illustrate several increases in crime rates when comparing the year ending June 2014 with the year ending June 2015. Assaults increased by 10% from 14,548 to 16,054. Burglaries increased by 8% from 26,589 to 28,830. Sexual offences increased by 3% from 2,006 to 2,072. Theft increased by 2% to 78,885, while fraud offences increased by 6% to 5,337. In the past year, the number of burglaries has risen by 2,241. In Dublin alone, burglaries have risen by 15%. Although these figures are startling as they stand, the true number of crimes may be much greater. An audit in June of Garda statistics from 2011 by the CSO located 75,000 crimes the Garda had not recorded, which included 5,100 burglaries. According to Cormac O'Keeffe of the  What can be said is that under the current Government, the rates of certain criminal offences continue to rise while Garda stations continue to close. In response to my parliamentary question regarding the closure of Garda stations, the Minister has confirmed that the Government has closed 139 stations, which has resulted in a minuscule saving of €556,000 per annum, as an average of just €4,000 per annum has been saved on utilities and maintenance per station. Such a small saving has had a disproportionate negative effect within rural communities and Sinn Féin is not alone in identifying this problem. A number of interested parties have identified the effects of such poor decision making. For example, according to the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, the decisions made by the Government to close Garda stations in service to an austerity agenda has resulted in increased crime and that ""We are now witnessing the human impact of...seven years of austerity"". The AGSI further outlined that its office has been inundated with concerns regarding increased crime, particularly in rural areas. There is a palpable sense of fear in rural communities as the services of the State retreat to urban areas far from where they are needed. At the funeral of John O'Donoghue, who died after disturbing burglars in August of this year, Fr. Tony Ryan stated ""Perhaps our politicians will see to increasing a Garda presence on the ground in rural Ireland again to reassure all who feel so alone"". It is difficult to see how the continuing closure of Garda stations will alleviate Fr. Ryan's concerns. In addition, according to a Garda source reported in  Similarly, Séamus Boland of Irish Rural Link has pointed out that the Government's only policy in place is the closure of court decisions. The high visibility of a local Garda station and the visible absence of such are advantageous only to those with criminal intent. Since the criminal fraternity knows which stations have closed, it means Garda presence is less and, presumably, the opportunity for evading gardaí is greater. Closing Garda stations directly undermines the confidence the community has in policing with reliability and speed of response being directly affected. As part of Sinn Féin's reform agenda, key principles which must inform any project of change for An Garda Síochána include policing with the community to develop maximum confidence in the policing service and to maximise co-operation between citizens and An Garda Síochána. The impact of rural crime and the absence of Garda stations is particularly apparent in neglected Border regions. At present, the delivery of policing and justice is undermined by partition. Criminality and illegality do not recognise borders and cross-Border co-operation makes sense for Border communities where common working and protocols can tackle criminal behaviour and can promote community safety. The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly carried out a detailed examination of cross-Border criminality over the course of a year and published its report earlier this year. Sinn Féin supports the 16 recommendations arising from its report and calls on the Government to act on those recommendations and in particular the call for a cross-Border and inter-agency police service joint task force to tackle these criminals head on. I wish to repeat a statement I made previously in the Chamber today. Those responsible for criminality in the Border areas are criminals. I do not care if some of them may have been in the IRA or not; they are criminals. They are a threat to communities and are taking huge amounts of money that could be spent on the health services and education systems on this island. I wish to see the PSNI and An Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners and HMRC on this island fully resourced in a joint task force to tackle these gangs head on and to remove their revenue from them. I read the Minister's interview with  If the Minister's focus is on tackling the Border gangs and taking resources from them, she will have 110% support from Sinn Féin. If her objectives are to implement the 16 recommendations from the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly and the suggestions by Ronnie Flanagan, who has had meetings here in recent times, we will fully support them. The message from these Houses, therefore, has to be that there is no political party or elected representative in these Houses and there is no elected representative on councils anywhere on the island who gives succour to criminality in any way, shape or form. We need to tell the Garda and the PSNI that they have the full support of these Houses to tackle that head on and we need to resource them to do that. I have met gardaí and PSNI officers in the North in my role as justice spokesperson and I have assured them that they have full support of our party. Whatever resources we can deploy collectively across the island, we need to do that. I would say to any journalist who has an agenda to cut out the nonsense. If journalists have evidence of criminality, they should produce it and cut out the nonsense and political agendas. They should take every single word I have said today as the justice spokesperson for Sinn Féin and print it in their newspaper next week rather than their utter nonsense and slurs of criminality against Irish republicans that they publish week in, week out. They should stop their nonsense and cop themselves on. Gardaí should be given the resources they need to do their job and the Minister will have 110% backing from my party if she needs it. People should stop criminalising members of my party. Frank McCabe is an Irish republican in south Armagh. Criminals tried to kill him in recent times for the stand he has taken and they almost killed his son. They put a booby trap bomb on a poster. That is the price we pay for confronting criminality in the Border area. Martin McGuinness's home was paint bombed; the house of two Sinn Féin councillors were petrol-bombed his year; the car of another senior Sinn Féin member was petrol-bombed; while three cars were petrol-bombed in Derry city. The lives of senior Sinn Féin people are threatened on a regular basis. I have had security advice from An Garda Síochána about my movements in the past. That is the price we pay for confronting criminality along the Border and, therefore, we will not take lessons from any journalist with a political agenda about our commitment to standing by democratic principles and confronting criminality. It is time for people to put up or shut up or end the slurs of criminality against our party. I am taking the opportunity to set the record straight and to make that clear. From now on, slurs of criminality against my party will be confronted head on. This is why I wrote to the Garda Commissioner, Nóirín O'Sullivan. I read an article in the  We have a situation where a handful of journalists with a long established political agenda - thankfully, it is only a small number of journalists, as the vast majority in this State are people of integrity who hold all of us, rightly, to account - thought they could bully a Garda Commissioner into backing down on her intelligence-based view versus their nonsense. The Minister also had to take some of this. I read the headlines attacking her for giving a balanced, reasoned view on matters that were developing. A tiny minority of journalists believe they can dictate to the Minister for justice and policing services of the day regarding the situation on the ground. I am sending a clear signal as the Sinn Féin justice spokesperson, on behalf of republicans across this island, that we will no longer take their slurs of criminality. If that is their agenda, they should put up the evidence, bring it to the appropriate authorities and let us see what happens. I have not seen evidence yet and I look forward to the day when it will be produced. Until then, I will let the people make their own assessment. I welcome the opportunity to set the record straight. The president of the Garda Representative Association described the position well regarding this Bill when he stated: ""Legislation is always welcome but legislation requires enforcement and enforcement requires gardaí. The only deterrent that can be out there is more gardaí"". Sinn Féin has repeatedly challenged the Government parties over their severe cuts to Garda numbers. While we welcome the renewed recruitment of recent times, the reality is that the additional numbers will merely counter-balance the loss of Garda personnel due to retirement. We need to get numbers back over the safe threshold of 14,000 and maintain that number through ongoing recruitment. Sinn Féin will continue to campaign on this. The Government's austerity agenda has unfortunately enabled the environment in which crime has increased. It is not the only contributory factor but it is not doing anything to help. A lack of resources is well known to increase cases of theft and burglary. Similarly, misguided decisions to close Garda stations to make small savings for the Exchequer have increased the opportunity for criminal activity and added to the uncertainty and fear citizens are experiencing following seven years of an austerity agenda. As always, the poor, isolated and vulnerable have suffered most because of austerity and the legislation, while welcome, does not address the root causes of the increase in criminal activity and the negative social consequences of austerity. Our citizens want a criminal justice system in which they can have confidence and which addresses serial offenders, in particular, who are clearly a threat to our communities. However, a more holistic approach is needed. We need to examine the resourcing of our policing services on the island and, as Deputy Collins said, we also need to examine enlightened approaches such as a sentencing council, similar to that in place in England and Wales, restorative measures in our communities, community courts, and community service orders rather than incarceration strategies. We need to identify when young people move towards criminality and devote resources to assist them. We, therefore, have to undertake a range of measures. While the Bill is welcome, I had to take the opportunity to reassert our criticism of austerity measures and I hope the Garda can be given the numbers it needs to do its job over the coming years."	spk_248

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-09-30	dail	31	Social Housing Policy: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_55	"What makes me angry is being told by people who have lived in this city all of their lives that when they walk around the city centre and see all the shop fronts full of people sleeping, in the pouring rain and freezing cold, that it is the worst they have ever seen - the worst in their lives. What makes me angry is that we paid huge amounts of money to developers for turn-key housing at the top of the market, and although the Minister's Government inherited an opportunity to get a very good deal for the taxpayer by purchasing blocks of housing at the bottom of the market, it sat on its hands and let the opportunity pass.What makes me angry is the fact that there are people working in this city earning a decent wage who cannot afford to pay their rent because rents are going through the roof. It makes me angry that the Minister, who is deputy leader of the Labour Party and sitting in a Chamber with a statue of James Connolly, cannot find it in his heart to take on the vested interests who put up rents in the city and all across the State. I am angry that he cannot confront greed and defend young people and young families who need to put a roof over their heads. I cannot understand how this crisis continues year after year. I have come to the view that it is now a policy, a decision of the Government to leave the market to itself while talking about capital plans and five-year investments. In reality, there is very little more on the table than would have been on it in the first place. What is the Minister going to do about it? What is his strategy? What is the Government to do for my county, where almost 200 council houses and a very significant number of private sector houses are empty? There are almost 3,000 on the housing list. They are ordinary people. Sometimes the best wisdom is derived from speaking to everyday people. They ask me how there can be so many empty houses across County Donegal. They ask why the Government does not pull the banks and NAMA together and why there is no strategy to ensure the houses are accessed and that people will have a chance to have a roof over their heads. Why can the Government not ensure that people pay a reasonable rent reflecting what they earn in this city and across the State? How come the Government allocates the housing assistance payment or rent supplement at a level that means people have to find hundreds of extra euro to pay their rent? One will never get a house for the amount of money the Government allocates to people. It tells people it has given them housing assistance and rent supplement and is doing all of that but the reality, which the Minister knows, is that in any town or city across the State, the amount of money allocated does not reflect the rental values. If one goes to the local estate agent to find a property, one will need to pay hundreds of euro more than one is receiving if one is to rent it. I say to ""Angry Alan"" that it is time to really find the right people to get angry with. It is time to have a strategy. It is time to go back to what his party is supposed to be about. He has only got a few months to save his bacon. I wish him all the best."	spk_795

The Bill was a central part of the “urgent reform” promised by the Government following the Garda crisis over a year ago. The whole area of administration and application of justice in the State has had a disturbing recent past. As a result, public confidence has been undermined and is slow to recover. The recovery has been hampered by unnecessary delays and a lack of urgency by this Government. That is, until the Taoiseach published the findings of the Fennelly report. I am glad to see the Bill before the House in the wake of the findings of the Fennelly commission. The Taoiseach tried to fight the Fennelly fire by selectively reading the findings and trying to convince himself that he was, somehow, vindicated. We all know that this is far from the truth. No amount of spin can cover up the fact that the report found that the sending of Mr. Brian Purcell to the home of the Garda Commissioner was the ""immediate catalyst"" for his decision to retire, and furthermore that this was a decision which the Commissioner was right to think was what he was being asked to do. The actions of the Attorney General, which left Mr. Justice Fennelly puzzled and perplexed, only added to the debacle and were testament to what Sinn Féin was saying all along, namely, that the Government did not have a handle on affairs and was at a loss to know what to do. The actions of those involved in the entire debacle were terrifying for those of us looking on. The people who were meant to be in charge of justice were not up to the job. It was a remarkable display of incompetence and definitely did not inspire confidence among the Members of these Houses or, more importantly, the citizens. This is exactly why we need an independent policing board with proper powers to oversee the administration of justice. I repeat: this is exactly why we need an independent policing board with proper powers to oversee the administration of justice. Sinn Féin has been consistently calling for an independent policing authority. We believe such an authority is central to the reform of policing in this State. An independent policing authority was an integral part of our reform document that we published last year, following our experiences of all submissions made in this State and the experiences of our team who negotiated the changes to policing in the North. The establishment of a policing authority is, therefore, welcome and a number of provisions in the Bill are commendable. The consultations and co-ordination with joint policing committees, in particular, is welcome. The creation of Garda performance targets is also a commendable action, as is the establishment of a Garda code of ethics. The overall objective in relation to the holding of the Garda Síochána to account and providing effective oversight is what is needed. Unfortunately, however, the Bill has a number of missed opportunities which should have ensured that the policing authority was truly independent in its functions. Contrary to what the Government is advocating, the authority, as proposed in the Bill, is not independent, nor does it have the necessary powers and functions we need. The authority, as the Government proposes, would not, if it had been established, have had any impact on the shambles of events as they unfolded during the period the Fennelly commission investigated. Under the Bill, the Garda Commissioner will still be accountable to the Minister, as was the case when the former Commissioner was effectively sacked. This is not in any way independent and Sinn Féin will seek to amend this so that the Garda Commissioner is accountable to the authority. Continuing with the theme of independence, I am concerned regarding the limited independence of the authority in the appointment of the Garda Commissioner and the deputy Garda commissioners. We support the recommendation from Transparency International that the authority should have the unrestricted ability to appoint and remove senior officers of the Garda Síochána, irrespective of their rank. An independent member of the Judiciary appointed by the Chief Justice, not by the Minister, should be responsible for the final determination of disputes as to whether a particular matter relates to policing services or security services. We will also seek to amend this aspect of the Bill. In general, the Bill should be amended in a number of areas to remove the requirement that the authority seek the consent of the Minister before exercising a particular function. The requirement that the authority seek the consent of the Minister before approving the annual report, as well as the Minister's, as opposed to the Garda Commissioner's, involvement in setting the Garda priorities limits the independence of the authority and undermines its very purpose. I note the flaws relating to membership of the authority. Sinn Féin has called for a 21 member authority to allow for a diverse membership that is representative of society.This authority would comprise 12 ordinary members, who would come through the public appointments process and would be representative of society, and nine political members, who would be elected using the d'Hondt method. The chairperson should also be elected by the 12 ordinary members, as opposed to being appointed by the Minister. I believe the absence of political representation on the authority is a mistake. Political representation, as in the North, would ensure public accountability and help to develop confidence in the policing authority. The composition of this political representation that has been proposed by Sinn Féin would not compromise the independence of the authority, as it would ensure an in-built majority of 12 independent ordinary members at all times. I note that the authority’s functions relating to the monitoring of human rights have been tampered with since the original general scheme of the Bill was first published. The human rights monitoring function is now entirely absent. Sinn Féin believes the authority has a central part to play in the monitoring of Garda compliance on human rights standards. The proposal to remove this function from the authority is unacceptable. Sinn Féin will seek to amend the Bill to re-insert this function. While we welcome the establishment of the policing authority, the remaining challenge is to ensure the authority is truly independent in the exercise of its functions. Sinn Féin believes in a new beginning for policing, similar to that in the Six Counties. We want an open and transparent policing service that is representative of everyone residing in this State. Such a service should be strengthened, sustainable and capable of delivering on the needs of a modern force. It should help to rebuild public confidence in our justice system. This Bill goes some way towards creating such a service. As I have outlined, there are a number of ways in which the authority could be strengthened, particularly with regard to its independence and oversight responsibilities. Sinn Féin will seek to do this on Committee and Report Stages. It is important to assert that despite the travails of recent years, the overwhelming majority of the men and women of An Garda Síochána who are serving today and have served over the decades are honourable, decent and patriotic. They deserve the full support of this State. We merely want to have a police service that does them justice. Such a service should be a genuine meritocracy in its appointment of sergeants, inspectors and superintendents. This applies right up to the Garda Commissioner, who should be appointed through an independent meritocratic process that is fully accountable to the new independent policing authority. That is where we want to get to. It is important for those of us who have known members of An Garda Síochána during our lives - we may have played football with them or served on community committees with them - and have spoken to them about the roles they play to reassert that the overwhelming majority of them deserve the loyalty and respect of these Houses. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of officers have been failed by the Garda Síochána's structures and systems and by a minority of their colleagues. That is the important message today. We are not seeking to sap the morale of gardaí or undermine the work they do. We want to make things better, stronger and more accountable. We want to boost and lift the morale of gardaí by giving them a professional policing service with some of the best standards in the world. It is important for gardaí to be able to get up in the morning and feel proud to be part of the force. That is the key challenge for us in these Houses."	spk_60

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-09-23	dail	31	Marriage Bill 2015: Second Stage	dbsect_16	"The events of 22 May 2015 changed lives forever. The result of a referendum in favour of marriage equality was hard-fought by equality champions along a journey that stretched back many years. They changed lives that day when they campaigned and marched for rights. Those people faced discrimination and intimidation and were labelled second-class citizens. Those people stood tall when others tried to bring them down on their knees. They knocked on doors, wore badges, spoke to their friends and built the movement for change and the movement for equality. These are the people I am so deeply honoured to call family, friends, comrades and fellow Irish men and women. They were ordinary people who carried out an extraordinary task. They saw injustice and set about to change it, and that is deeply commendable. Sinn Féin welcomes this Bill to the floor of the House with open arms. It is a momentous occasion, where we as a people come together to end a two-tier system of marriage inequality. Sometimes in reading from a speech it is much better to speak from the heart. Today I will stick to the strict script and we can enjoy the peculiarities of parliamentary practice. Marriage is about one thing: love, and a lasting commitment to honour love. Nobody should ever be denied that opportunity. It is quite difficult to sum up the magnitude of this decision. It is hard to put into words the effects that this will have, the happiness for thousands of citizens and their families and the foundation it has laid to build on this equality and expand it in terms of socio-economic rights to others at the margins of society. This great occasion called for something different. It needed to hear a voice representing those who it affects the most. The following is an extract from a letter that was sent to me from a gay man who became a civil partner in May and now plans on becoming a husband. Chris put his journey into words and they carry much more weight than mine. He states:As a gay man who in his formative years was terrified by my own identity, it is impossible to accurately communicate the meaning of what the result truly means to me. When I was a teenager I hated myself because I did not fit in, I did not belong, I was an outcast. I thought that being gay was a feeling that would just go away and that someday I’d marry and have my own family. The feeling of being attracted to another man never went away. In reality, the law told me I was a criminal. The church told me I was an abomination and the mere mention of being gay in the schoolyard was enough to set off alarm bells that stopped me from being the person I wanted to be. Although the decriminalisation of homosexuality took away the criminalisation aspect, it did not change how I felt inside. Inside, I had a shadow over me, a scar, and I was wounded. My true identity was not just hidden from my friends and family – it was hidden from me. I was oppressed by my own conditioning and the loneliness nearly killed me, for nobody knew the isolation in my head.He continues:Coming out was one of the most terrifying moments of my life. I had to ask those around me for their approval. I was terrified they'd reject me and I'd become further isolated in my own loneliness. In the end, nobody rejected me. Those around me only wanted me to be happy and to encounter the true feeling of love. You see - the isolation and marginalization was embedded in my subconscious since my early teens. It took years for me to see it and to deal with it. From working with groups like Gay Switchboard I knew I wasn't alone and I know there's many more like me. Four years ago I found that love. I found the most beautiful kind hearted [soul] and I cherish every day I have with him. It took me 40 years to find him and I'd wait another 40 years to spend just one day in his company, to experience just one moment of the serenity of love. We're planning on getting married in August. We don't know if it will be a civil partnership or marriage as the legislation may not be through in time. But we don't care because May 23rd represented our freedom, our emancipation! For me, The Marriage Equality Referendum represents the abolition of the shadow I held inside. The emphatic nature of the result was Irish society saying it's OK to be gay - it's OK to be different and we want you. It was normal Irish people sending a message to say we are equal and they want to shake off the shackles of the past and demanding a new, equal Ireland. On the day of the count, when we were inside the central count centre waiting for the final declaration in Dublin Castle, it was an honour to be there but my heart was not in the courtyard. I wanted to be outside. I wanted to be with my soul mate. That's my only regret but I'm sure there'll be plenty of time to make up for it. I'd go so far as saying that in a hundred years' time the 23rd of May will been seen as, not Ireland's, but one of humanity's proudest moments because it was a day when equality conquered fear. Perhaps May 23rd should become a bank holiday and called Equality Day to remind future generations of the significance of, not just our emancipation, but the equality of every citizen.I wanted to read Chris's words into the record today because they say much more than the typical contribution from a political party to a Bill on a day like this. Just reading them now has the hair standing on the back of my neck. Chris's journey, and the journey of thousands like him, is admirable. It makes me proud that I put an X next to the Tá box on the day of the referendum. This Bill is, therefore, welcome. I commend the speed with which the Government has brought it before the House following the court challenges and it goes without saying that Sinn Féin will not be submitting any amendments, but will facilitate the speediest passage possible through both Houses in order that Chris, and other couples throughout the State, can marry the person they love as soon as possible. There is a Gaeilge saying: ""Níl aon leigheas ar an ngrá ach pósadh"", meaning ""There is no cure for love, but marriage"". To stand in this House to legislate for that love, for marriage equality, is an honour."	spk_100

However, it appears that the will of the people may be subject to indefinite delay as the courts deal with a petition challenging the outcome of the referendum. While it is the right of a citizen to initiate such a petition, this is not the first time a petition challenging the outcome of a referendum has resulted in a lengthy delay for citizens in being afforded the protection of their newly recognised rights. The children's rights referendum was passed on 10 November 2012, but the High Court only reached a decision on 24 April this year on the petition lodged, a delay of two and a half years. A further example is the delay experienced following the divorce referendum when a petition challenging the result caused a delay of six months. Delays in implementing the democratic will of the people, as expressed in a referendum, are not acceptable. The current legislation only stipulates that the courts must deal with petitions as a matter of priority. This is not adequate, as the courts are not adhering to this provision. We all know that the system is clogged, but when constitutional rights and newly decided referenda decisions are impacted on, extraordinary measures must be available and priority status accorded. The Bill seeks to amend the Referendum Act 1994 to provide that the High Court would ordinarily make a finding on such a petition within 90 days of it being heard. It further seeks to provides that where such a finding is challenged by way of appeal, the Supreme Court would endeavour to make a finding on a petition no later than 90 days from the date on which the appeal was lodged. This would give the courts a clear timeframe within which to deal with any petition, while retaining the necessary flexibility required by the administration of justice.  The intention of the Bill is to send a clear message to citizens, including our friends in the LGBT community, that we have not forgotten about them. When the people speak, the State must listen. There is nothing that can trump the democratic will of the people. The arms of the State must, at all times, protect it above all else. We cannot allow a situation where legal delays impact on a citizen's hard fought for rights. That is why we are asking the Government to support the Bill to bring such delays to an end.	spk_484

On 20 March 2013, shortly after being prescribed the antidepressant, Prozac, 14 year old Jake McGill Lynch ended his own life using a firearm. Jake, who was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, was given the antidepressant drug despite research stating the drug has no benefit for children with Asperger's syndrome and despite the emerging evidence of harm. In the midst of their grief, Jake's parents have come to understand that their personal tragedy is one that has been shared by thousands of families whose loved ones have died as a result of antidepressant-induced suicide. I welcome Jake's parents, John and Stefani, to the Visitors Gallery today. They have worked tirelessly to bring attention to this issue and to campaign for a change to the law. Their request is simple. They want the Coroners Act to be amended in order that a coroner can return a verdict of iatrogenic - medically induced - suicide where such is the case. It is an issue that must be highlighted. A verdict of suicide, returned in accordance with the provisions of the 1962 Act, must be differentiated from a verdict of iatrogenic suicide. Iatrogenic suicide is the ending of one's own life where the effect of medical treatment undertaken by the deceased, including any prescribed medication, is the primary cause of such an action. We understand that the publishing of this Bill is symbolic. It is obvious that the Coroners Act 1962 is no longer fit for purpose and should be repealed and replaced with an amended version of the Coroners Bill 2007 as a matter of priority. The amended version of the 2007 Bill should contain a comprehensive list of verdicts open for a coroner or a jury, as the case may be, to return. When it is finally amended, this list should provide for a verdict of iatrogenic suicide to be made. I hope the Government will support this Bill."	spk_494

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-07-16	dail	31	Appointment of Chairperson of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission: Motion	dbsect_49	The Minister will be aware that the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality was tasked with examining the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and considering ways of strengthening GSOC, having a policing authority, ensuring the accountability of the Garda and setting up new structures. One of our recommendations was to replace the current three-person commission with one ombudsman, as is the case in the North and other jurisdictions. We need to move to such a structure where the buck would stop with one person. In a number of controversies in recent years, there was speculation about how the system of three people making a collective decision worked. Consider the various ombudsmen we have, from the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, to the sectoral ombudsmen. Each comprises just one person and the buck stops with him or her, although each has senior advisers. I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted this model. I have no issue with the ability of Ms Justice Ring. I am sure she will make an excellent chairperson. My issue is that I would like one person to be the ombudsman and to speak on behalf of that organisation. The other issue I wish to raise is the powers given to the ombudsman. The House saw some amendments to the legislation earlier this year that strengthened the ombudsman's powers, but I would like to see them strengthened further. Something about which I am concerned and which I will revisit when we deal with the Garda authority legislation is the matter of the independent adjudicator.The Minister will recall that Conor Brady, formerly GSOC member, at a conference organised by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Law Society of Ireland, suggested that where An Garda Síochána could not give information to the Ombudsman - soon to be the Garda authority - for security reasons, there be an independent adjudicator, a member of the Judiciary rather than the Minister, to decide if the grounds for withholding information are legitimate. Perhaps we might revisit this through the Garda authority legislation as it makes its way through the Houses. Resources for GSOC will be critical. It has been tasked with looking at the area of penalty points and will have more and more responsibilities. There are over 300 cases alleging Garda malpractice and I imagine more work will fall on GSOC. One of the concerns the public has is the length of time GSOC can take to carry out investigations, which impacts on its credibility and the confidence of the public. It needs the requisite resources and the Minister should engage with the commissioners around this issue to make sure they have the resources required to deliver investigations within a reasonable period of time.  I ask the Minister to look again at the need for just one Garda ombudsman, similar to the ombudsman for every other sector on these islands. In line with the all-party recommendation of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I also ask her to look at the issue of resourcing GSOC adequately and to look at the issue of security. She should put in place an independent adjudicator to make it clear to the public that full accountability and oversight exist as required across the whole spectrum.	spk_546
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-07-14	dail	31	Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2015: First Stage	dbsect_24	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the provisions of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to exempt charity events and local community based festivals and events from policing service charges and to provide for related matters.The Bill is a response to allegations that members of the Garda Síochána have been charging local community groups for the policing of local festivals and events. It is unacceptable that local community, voluntary and charity groups are expected to foot the bill for policing services and events and festivals. These groups are made up of committed and hard-working volunteers who plan and organise events and festivals to benefit local communities and businesses. Such groups often have to fund-raise to make such events happen and it is unfair to require them to pay for the work of the Garda Síochána on top of this. Charity events, community fairs and annual parish festivals are the lifeblood of rural communities. Such events encourage tourism and contribute to community spirit. It makes no sense to demand that organising committees pay for policing. In my county, Donegal, the thousands of euro demanded of one festival organising committee far exceeds the grants given to the festival by Donegal County Counsel and Fáilte Ireland. One arm of the State is paying for the services of another while local communities are burdened with the cost. Organisations that organise large-scale, commercial concerts and events that generate large revenues and profits should cover the cost of policing such events. However, section 30 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which allows for requesting such payments, must be amended in respect of local community events, festivals and charity events, in order to protect our local groups and encourage local tourism. The Bill does that. It amends section 30 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to exempt local cultural and heritage festivals, fundraising events for registered charities, local events organised on a voluntary basis and events that reinvest all profits for the benefit of the local community from the obligation to pay for policing services. Last week, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, said a policy review would suffice to address the problem.

He would have seen for himself the impact of mica in terms of defective blocks in homes in Donegal. The scale of this, in terms of the amount of homes affected, is not fully known at this stage but the impact is clear. There are families this evening in my county who are literally living in terror that their ceiling or gable wall would collapse on top of them such is the seriousness of this issue. There are also families in Donegal this evening who cannot insure their homes because of this problem. My colleague, Councillor Albert Doherty, has relentlessly pushed Donegal County Council to carry out testing on some of the housing stock in the county and a preliminary engineer's report has unfortunately found that mica is impacting on the homes that were tested. There is a lot more work to be done, but it is a serious development and confirms the worst fears of many within the county. I understand that preliminary engineer's report has been sent on to the Department and I welcome the news that the Minister has established an independent panel of experts, but here is my concern. Earlier I looked through the 200-page report and 20 recommendations of the panel of experts which dealt with the pyrite issue. Is the Minister reinventing the wheel? Have they not set a strong template? How long will this independent panel of experts take to report back? I have met the families of which I speak in their homes. I attended a public meeting where they told their story. They are literally living in terror that the ceiling above them or the gable wall beside them will collapse on top of them. Their homes are not insured. The banks are not taking responsibility. Such is the seriousness of this issue. They cannot wait, perhaps for years, for an independent panel to report. We need urgent action. I repeat the call of my party on the Minister to introduce a mica muscovite redress Bill as soon as possible over the summer recess, to bring that Bill before the Houses in the autumn and to implement a mica redress scheme, as this Government has done rightly for those families affected by the issue of pyrite. The impact is similar. Of course, these are separate deficiencies that affect the structure of the home but, if one looks at the 20 recommendations of the panel established on pyrite, I imagine they would almost all apply to this issue of mica. The Department had submitted blocks for testing. What was the outcome of those tests? Did they confirm the presence of mica in the blocks that were tested? In terms of this panel of experts that the Minister will establish, is it reinventing the wheel? Is there a danger that it would drag on for far too long?

We are concerned that the new wording, taken in conjunction with the proposal in section 13, will mean that those in restructured arrangements may not be eligible for a court review. The purpose of the amendments seems at first glance only to strengthen the hand of the banks in putting up another obstacle for the debtor to surmount. The unamended section does not mention restructured debt. By explicitly mentioning it, I fear its purpose could be to exclude rather than include. Additionally, given what the Central Bank's review has shown up in terms of the scandalous failure of banks to implement the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, I wonder whether that particular obstacle for a debtor is inherently unfair. It is said that we have to play by the rules but we know the banks have not been playing by them. We will listen to the Minister's explanation and we will discuss with our Seanad colleagues whether we may seek to amend this Bill in the Seanad.	spk_267

After the Opposition repeatedly raised its concerns, we finally got a promise that the banks' veto would be scrapped. Is the veto gone? In some cases, it is subject to the courts, while in other cases it is not clear at all, from our interpretation. If someone falls into arrears after 2 January this year, the banks still have their veto. What is really being proposed is a temporary empowering of the courts in some circumstances to overrule a bank's veto if certain conditions are met. That is not what was promised as far as I am concerned. We believe the veto will remain in the majority of cases. We know how adept the banks are at getting their way. I have major doubts as to whether the solution will work for the vast majority of mortgage holders or others in debt. The Government has taken quite a while to come to this Stage and we are concerned that only those eligible for a personal insolvency arrangement, and not just a debt settlement arrangement, have any chance of appealing. We would like to get the Minister's response to those concerns, and we reserve the right to propose amendments in the Seanad if we cannot get assurance in respect of our concerns.	spk_275

I am aware of a festival in Donegal which struggles to raise funds every year. They got some funding from local government or arts bodies for their festival.

The gardaí in Donegal are very upset about this. They feel it is bad enough that their resources in the county have been cut back, the numbers of gardaí have come down and their relationship with local communities is struggling as a result, but then they have to charge the organisers €4,000 for policing of a festival that is invested back into the local community. That is merely one example and I could give the Minister many more. I believe the Minister needs to amend the section 30 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-07-07	dail	31	Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill 2015: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_31	Through their contributions last Friday and today, Government Deputies have tried their hardest to steer the debate away from the real reason for this Bill. It is obvious that this is a desperate attempt to follow on from the undemocratic process with which the Government rammed through the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill last week, all in the hope that outstanding issues relating to the water charges disaster would be tied up before the summer recess and would not need to be debated in the autumn before a possible election. People can see right through this. They see what the Government is trying to do and will remember this come election time. The fight against the Government's unjust water taxes is far from over. Those in the Government will not sweep the matter under the carpet, because the people, and those of us in the House who stand up for them, will not let them. Claims to the effect that the Bill has come from the Law Reform Commission, that it does not apply to debts to moneylenders, that it is a necessary step to solve a civil debt problem, that the courts have safeguards in place to afford protection, and the great line that it differentiates between those who cannot pay and those who will not, are spin to avoid admitting the Bill's real purpose. I have yet to see how the Bill differentiates in any meaningful way between those who cannot pay and those who will not. The Government's spin does not address any of the real concerns. I draw the Minister of State's attention to quotes from the speech of the Minister for Justice and Equality at the launch of the report of the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, yesterday. She stated:Many, many people obviously want to pay their debts, and those who can pay them will pay them. No reasonable person will resent seeing someone who has fallen on hard times benefit from proportionate debt forgiveness.The hypocrisy is unbelievable. The Government is in favour of debt forgiveness by legislating for a mechanism to take unpaid debt directly from a person's wages or social welfare. How does this work? The Bill is an obvious attempt to target those on low pay or social welfare. We are discussing sums that are relatively small for those in the higher echelons of society. For ordinary people, though, debts of this level have a serious impact on their lives. These are the people who will be targeted disproportionately. The Government is afraid that its Irish Water plans are coming apart at the seams. The truth is that they are. The Bill is intimidation on the Government's part. It is an underhanded attempt to transform the Government's fear about Irish Water into the people's fear that they may be dragged before the courts for their accumulated debts. People are not naive; they can see through this. What the Bill deals with is legislatively unnecessary and avoidable, or at least, it was until the Government needed such a mechanism in order to prop up the power of its own creditor, Irish Water. Let me be clear: Irish Water must be abolished, and there should be no need for recovery of unpaid charges at all. Regarding other creditors, Sinn Féin opposes the Bill because it does not require creditors to consider whether there is a more appropriate way to deal with disputes before rushing to the courts, further clogging the system, to get legal orders against persons in debt. Civil debt is a serious strain on anyone. The Bill seeks to punish those who fall into this trap, mostly those on low wages or social welfare who are already living on the poverty line, by giving creditors the option to drag them before a judge without any need to try to solve the dispute through a less adversarial method. Sinn Féin has submitted amendments to the Bill for consideration on Committee Stage. They are simple. Of the 27 sections, only one is of merit. Section 26 repeals Parts I and IV of the Debtors Act (Ireland) 1872. It is the only section that we support. I wish to address some of the bizarre comments made by Deputy Catherine Byrne on Friday. She must have seen some of the media coverage over the weekend and realised the stupidity of her comments and just how far removed she is from the majority of citizens in the State. It must be difficult for her stretching her budget in such a way. After all, one could hardly fill a shopping basket on a basic salary of €87,000 per year. Deputy Catherine Byrne, in referencing this Bill, stated that people had a civic responsibility to pay debts, including debts relating to water charges. I am happy that she acknowledged this, but how does an increase in the pensions of former Taoisigh and Ministers contribute to their civic responsibility? How does a ministerial pay increase contribute? I am sure the Deputy will be delighted that she, too, can now afford a little luxury by way of a bottle of wine at the weekend, with a salary increase on the cards for Deputies as well. It is insulting to suggest that the low-paid and those on welfare, whom this Bill targets, have not paid their way. Do Government Deputies even bother to read their e-mails or talk to people in their constituencies? In case Deputy Catherine Byrne is oblivious to how her voting record in this Dáil has forced those on low pay or welfare to contribute to their civic responsibility more than any other sector of society, here are some statistics to help her understand. They were compiled by Dr. Rory Hearne and published at the weekend. The eight austerity budgets between 2008 and 2014 involved €18.5 billion in cuts to public spending. Public service staff numbers have been reduced by 37,500, or 10%. The health budget has seen a 27% cut, with an 81% increase in the number of patients on trolleys in hospital waiting rooms. Funding for local authority housing was cut from €1.3 billion in 2007 to just €83 million in 2013. There were cuts to lone parent payments, which happened last week, as well as to child benefit and fuel allowance, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, rent supplement, and disability and carer's allowances. There have been extra charges for households, including water, property, school transport, prescription and third level fees, on top of an increase in living costs.There has been a 50% cut to community, youth and rural development schemes. The obvious result has been hundreds of thousands of families pushed into poverty. Food poverty in Ireland affects 600,000 people. Are these the people that Deputy Byrne believes are filling their trolleys with drink? I hope the Deputy realises how much hurt her comments have caused to hundreds of thousands of struggling people who have more than paid off their civic responsibility. This Bill aims to bleed such people dry for the benefit of Irish Water in cases where there may be some unpaid debt. The points raised by Deputy Byrne raise serious questions about the mindset of this Government. I suggest that her insulting remarks expose a deeper problem, which is the Government's belief that it has the power to dictate to people in this State how they should live their lives and what they can and cannot afford. This is indicative of the Government's mindset on the very purpose of this Bill. The Government appears to believe it is acceptable to draft legislation to dictate to people how much money should be deducted from their hard-earned wages and how that money should be spent. This is not how democracy works. It is certainly not the right way for the Government to deal with its water charge failures. Sinn Féin will submit amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage. We will not support the Bill as it is. It must be amended to delete all sections which advocate a flawed approach to the recovery of debt. An adversarial approach is not the way forward. The only section of merit in the entire Bill is that providing for the abolition of the imprisonment of debtors, which is a sensible proposal. The rest of the Bill misses the bigger picture. It is unnecessary and ruthless to allow companies, including Irish Water, to use bully tactics to recover debt in this way. It is not the direction that legal resolutions are heading in. For the most part, the courts are heading down a path of mediation and dispute resolution. To allow creditors to use the courts as a first option, as this Bill does, undermines the direction the courts are taking. It is not an acceptable way for the Government to deal with the problem it will face in trying to enforce the unjust and unfair water tax that has been imposed on our people.	spk_246

In fact, it gets harder because as the reality of what the Government decides on paper in here comes knocking on the doors of ordinary families across the State, the increasing effects of successive cuts are unavoidable. These cutbacks affect all walks of lives, all generations and all communities across our society. The real-life consequences are life changing, heart breaking and often that one cut too far that turns basic living for families into a daily struggle to survive. The Sinn Féin motion is another attempt to make this Government act on its sheer lack of basic compassion. It is another attempt to try to alert the Government to the impact of its actions. This cut to lone parents is going to be another cut that plunges families further into inescapable poverty. It will cripple single mothers and single fathers with unbearable child care costs and it will mean that, for many, life as they know it will change for the worse. However, this is not the first time the Government has picked on vulnerable lone parents. Some 11,000 lone parents have already been affected by gradual reductions in their payments. These cuts have caused unimaginable hardship for lone-parent families, 63% of whom are struggling to afford the basic necessities. However, the Government has once again managed to outdo itself and the next round of cuts to lone parents will impact on 30,000 families. Where does the Government expect these lone parents to get the money to pay the extortionate child care costs? The Tánaiste promised that these cuts would not be implemented until child care was affordable and afterschool care was made available. That has not happened. It is sad to see just how much the Tánaiste's promises are worth. I wonder whether the Government has any idea just how crippling child care costs actually are. Given the cost of child care, it often becomes the case that two-parent families are in full-time work with one wage being solely to cover the cost of someone to look after the children. It can be the case that the child care burden is left to an aging grandparent or an older sibling and it is often the case that it is not economical for families to have both parents at work, so the second parent has to stay at home. In my constituency of Donegal North-East, to give one example although I could give many, I know of a hardworking young couple, a construction worker and a nurse with two young children who could only afford for one parent to work because of crippling child care costs. It did not make sense for both of them to work and they were not lucky enough to have a relative living close by to give them a helping hand. What happens in those cases where there is no second parent? What happens to single mothers and fathers who cannot afford to pay someone to look after the children? The cut to their allowance will mean that staying at home will be the only viable option. Does the Government expect lone parents to leave their livelihood behind and stay at home to live off welfare? I would hope that this is not something the Government is advocating because apart from the fact that such support is inadequate for families to live off, the mental health and economic implications are far from ideal. The Tánaiste must see that is the reality of these cutbacks. She has tied the hands of lone parents and is guiding them into a bleak and unsustainable future. Lone-parent households were a priority for Sinn Féin in our alternative budget last year. Cutbacks are not the way to go in helping these families. What is needed is an increase to the earnings disregard on the one-parent family payment scheme, increases to fuel allowance, FIS, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the restoration of some dignity to lone parents. The Tánaiste should consider what she is doing here. The cuts to the lone parents allowance must be reversed. If she was to abandon her plans, she would receive nothing but support. Stop bullying some of our most vulnerable citizens and give them a chance. Lone parent families have been through enough without enduring the further hardship these cuts will cause. I urge the Tánaiste to remember that what she decides here on paper has real-life consequences for vulnerable families in this State.	spk_309
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-06-30	dail	31	White Paper on Defence: Statements	dbsect_39	I take this opportunity to welcome the news tonight of the appointment of Rear Admiral Mark Mellett as chief of staff of the Defence Forces. It was my pleasure to join the Oireachtas justice committee when we were hosted at Haulbowline. We viewed the facilities and learned about the exciting plans for the Naval Service. We also had the opportunity to look at the Irish maritime energy resource cluster which is the partnership between Cork Institute of Technology, UCC and the Naval Service. The presentation given by Rear Admiral Mellett that day was one of the most inspirational I have ever listened to, whether public or private. He is an inspirational public servant and I am personally delighted at his appointment. He will be a superb, a visionary and ambitious chief of staff. It is a great appointment. I broadly welcome a review of Ireland's defence policy and a White Paper on the issue. It is an opportunity to outline exactly how we would like a modern, efficient and professional Defence Force to stand by the long-held Irish desire for neutrality and independence, as expressed by Sinn Féin in our submission. However, I fear that this Government will use it to do the opposite, having seen successive governments repeatedly undermine Ireland's neutrality and attack the pay and entitlements of Defence Forces personnel. The last White Paper on Defence was released in 2000. Since their founding in 1922, the Irish Defence Forces are and have been a great source of pride to the Irish people, particularly for their role in overseas peacekeeping missions. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the members of the Irish Defence Forces for their commitment to the State. We also owe it to Defence Forces to ensure that they are equipped with everything they need to ensure that they carry out their responsibilities to the highest possible standard. The change from a three-brigade to a two-brigade structure and the closure of barracks across the State, has sapped the morale of the Defence Forces. Not only the closures but the entire process has put stress and strain on personnel who often had to uproot from their communities and homes with their families to be placed somewhere else. As always, those who serve in our Defence Forces have now adapted to the new reality in their service tradition but the Government should not take this as an indication that all is well. It is incumbent on the Minister for Defence and the Minister of State to meet on a regular basis with PDFORRA to monitor the impact of these changes from the perspective of those serving at the coal face. I hope the White Paper will contain a commitment to this.The White Paper must also focus on issues concerning the Reserve Defence Force. Sinn Féin has asked members of the RDF about their impression over recent years. They are very saddened by the huge cutbacks they have faced because the RDF is a link of patriotism between the Defence Forces and the local communities. This is particularly the case for young people. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the White Paper includes a commitment from the Government to engage on a regular basis with the RDF's representative association in order to hear its concerns and to ensure that we do not lose that which has been best about the service its members have given down the years. I emphasise the point about regular meetings between the Minister and the representative organisations. It was one of the profound criticisms I had of the previous Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter. As with much of the work he did it was quite arrogant and dismissive. At the end of the day if a Minister cannot listen to those representing the people at the coalface even if he or she disagrees with their assessment, how is it possible to have a partnership and truly develop? I hope the Minister is taking a very different approach. My sense from any engagements I have had with him in the time I have been here is that he is respectful and listens and engages. I wish him well in what I hope will be a very different approach from that of the previous Minister. In emergencies the work of the Defence Forces via the Civil Defence is immeasurable. I take this opportunity to commend the work of the Civil Defence, the ordinary people across Ireland who do extraordinary things acting in a voluntary capacity as members of communities. In this White Paper the Government must give an assurance that funding will be maintained for Civil Defence training programmes and activities. We must continue to resource the Civil Defence and give its members the necessary training. We must continue to facilitate active citizenship. Our party is opposed to the use of the anti-malarial drug, Lariam. Many serving and former soldiers, who have been prescribed Lariam, have experienced adverse psychological effects and experienced a serious negative impact on their health and wellbeing. I urge the Minister to use the White Paper or whatever means at his disposal to ensure that no member of the Defence Forces is put at risk as a result of being given Lariam during future deployments The core of this White Paper must be a commitment to enhance neutrality. One of the biggest developments since the first White Paper on defence in 2000 is the increased militarisation of the EU and the State's deeper integration in this military system. Sinn Féin's support for neutrality is the product of a developed and coherent republican position stretching back over 200 years of Irish history. From the beginning, Irish republicans have identified an independent foreign policy as one of the essential characteristics of the independent Irish State to which we aspire. It has always been a fundamental demand of those struggling for Irish freedom. Sinn Féin continues this republican tradition and therefore is committed to promoting positive Irish neutrality and independent foreign policy. We believe Ireland should actively work to promote conflict resolution, peaceful democratic settlements and self-determination throughout the world. Consecutive Governments have repeatedly assured the people that they support neutrality. However, since 1997 when a previous Government signed Ireland up to NATO's ironically called Partnership for Peace, despite pre-election promises to the contrary, we have seen a repeated attack on Irish neutrality, including the US military's unfettered use of Shannon Airport, and peaking with the actions and rhetoric of the current Government. An estimated 2.25 million US troops have passed through Shannon Airport since 2002, making it a virtual forward airbase of the US military, a pit-stop on their way to the theatre of war. I remind the Minister that in the case of Iraq, it was a war that was not sanctioned by the United Nations. The Government has refused to use its legal powers to stop and search these aeroplanes and they continue to peddle the distortion that all the foreign military aircraft that land at Shannon Airport are unarmed, carrying no arms, ammunition or explosives, and are not engaged in intelligence gathering, and that the flights do not form any part of military exercises or operations. This is despite the huge amount of evidence to the contrary that came out during the recent court cases involving Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly. In addition the Government shamefully voted down Sinn Féin's neutrality Bill in March. The Bill sought to reaffirm Ireland's neutrality by seeking a referendum to insert neutrality into the Constitution. Even though a Peace and Neutrality Alliance-commissioned RED-C poll, published in September 2013, showed that approximately eight out of ten Irish people are in favour of neutrality - a massive and maybe unprecedented number - and despite the fact that the Labour Party supported this same Bill in opposition, it and its Fine Gael partner voted it down. Hence my pessimism that this White Paper will help enforce and safeguard Irish neutrality. Even at this late hour I urge the Minister to ensure that this White Paper notes that in a world where half of the population lives in poverty, with one person in every eight suffering from malnutrition, where poverty kills approximately 19 people around the world every minute, in 2011 US$1.738 trillion was spent globally on military expenditure. To ensure that we live in a safer and more equal world greater military expenditure is definitely not the solution. Instead we need to challenge the very structures that cause poverty, food insecurity and conflict. I urge the White Paper to establish Ireland's commitment to positive neutrality, instead of veiled support for NATO and EU militarism. Positive neutrality is not about sitting on the fence. It is not about taking no action. It is not about pacifism. Sinn Féin is not a pacifist political party; I think that is pretty obvious. Consistent with the principles of international law, we believe that the use of force can sometimes be necessary as a last resort to prevent the deaths of others or the oppression of peoples. Sinn Féin makes no apologies for having recognised the right of the Irish people over the ages to use force against the British occupation of our country. Instead positive neutrality is about actively promoting and participating in conflict resolution, demilitarisation and making politics work to redress legitimate grievances and achieve needed social changes, at both state and international levels. If we redoubled our efforts to focus on working with countries to implement global targets on issues such as land rights, climate change, citizen participation, economic equality and government accountability, the world would inevitably become a better and safer place. Furthermore Sinn Féin fully supports the role of Irish troops in peacekeeping missions around the world under the auspices of the UN. We believe that the State's history of serving in UN blue-helmet peacekeeping missions is a matter of pride and can enhance our standing as a neutral state, and the White Paper should reflect that. Neutrality therefore is not a policy of opting out of international affairs; rather it is a commitment to a different type of international politics focused on justice, development and human rights. The first of three pillars of a positive neutrality policy is the Defence Forces participating in UN blue-helmet peacekeeping operations. The second pillar is an enhanced involvement in overseas development aid. I was previously the Sinn Féin foreign affairs spokesperson. Obviously as part of any portfolio one educates oneself on the issues. I was so proud to learn from the Irish NGOs working on overseas development aid that Ireland for a period had the highest  The third pillar is human rights advocacy.In the history of the State there have been great champions of human rights and of conflict resolution. We have significant skills and a track record in conflict resolution that come from our most recent conflict. For all its limitations and continuing challenges, what we achieved collectively in the North is a beacon of hope for people in conflict around the world. Those are the three pillars of positive neutrality I would love to see our State and Government embrace. In these volatile times a strong commitment to positive neutrality in this White Paper is needed more than ever. It should not act as another Fine Gael 'beyond neutrality' document. Whatever a political party’s perspective on a matter, it is clear that the overwhelming desire of the Irish people is to actively participate in international affairs in an independent fashion and in a way that makes a real constructive impact and plays to our strengths but that fundamentally we are genuinely neutral and not associated in any way, shape or form with military alliances. 	spk_365

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-06-24	dail	31	Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) (Amendment) Bill 2014 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_36	"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. First, like Deputies on all sides of the House, I understand the growing international aspect of crime. It is obvious that crime does not confine itself behind borders. As legislators, it is our job to be aware of such dynamics and play our part in making sure that such crime is combatted so that our communities are safe. Sinn Féin will support this Bill's passage to Committee Stage. International mutual assistance is an important part of tackling the growth in cross-border crime. We must be able to rely on other states to help us ensure that criminals are brought to justice. The same is true in reverse. Other member states must be able to seek our help, where possible, to achieve justice. However, we must be mindful of how such information is passed on and how the practical application of mutual assistance in such matters is balanced with the human rights of citizens. This Bill seeks to amend the Act of 2008 to provide for the enactment of outstanding instruments that the Oireachtas has previously ratified. This amending Bill, as the Minister has already pointed out, has many technical aspects. There is no need for a debate on these technical aspects; rather, it is important to focus on the broader principles of law that the Bill seeks to amend and the implications of such amendments for citizens. In this regard, it is appropriate to outline Sinn Féin's view on international justice co-operation. Sinn Féin supports, in principle, inter-jurisdictional police co-operation on investigation of serious crimes with a cross-border dimension. We want to see a scenario in which such co-operation is authorised on a case-by-case basis, limited to the necessary, and with appropriate safeguards and accountability mechanisms in place. Sinn Féin strongly supports effective action against cross-border organised criminal activity, such as the trafficking of human beings and drugs, evasion of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of fuel and tobacco, and offences involving the trafficking of children. However, we believe it is equally essential to safeguard against the creation of further victims through human rights violations. Judicial and legal harmonisation, such as the mutual assistance aspects of this Bill, must only be to the extent that it advances human rights standards. It is important to point out that Sinn Féin believes that the people of Ireland should have full sovereignty over justice matters. The Irish people alone have the right to determine policy questions and set the law regarding the administration of justice in Ireland. Although we recognise the merit of this particular Bill, Sinn Féin does not support the development of an EU super-state architecture in respect of justice matters. We do not support the creation of a so-called European legal area with a European criminal code and a European public prosecutor. Sovereignty over justice matters must remain firmly in the hands of the people of the EU member states. Sinn Féin rejects the federalist trend towards incremental integration and the centralisation of policing and judicial powers, ending in the eventual establishment of an EU border guard, EU police and an EU public prosecutor. We believe these are matters for sovereign states. We also reject the accelerating impetus to harmonise criminal law between EU member states, because it is being done without first ensuring the harmonisation of rights protections, which currently vary widely from state to state. These are issues that must be debated seriously on Committee Stage. Although the implications of this Bill may be small in the grand scheme of things, it is the grand scheme of things that we need to focus on. We cannot lose sight of where instruments such as those contained in this Bill are leading us. In turning to the specific provisions contained in this Bill, I note the Minister's comments during the debate in the Seanad. In explaining the term ""mutual assistance"", the Minister stated that this enabled ""a state to provide, within its own jurisdiction, a service to another state related to the administration of justice in the latter"". There is no doubt that co-operation of this kind is necessary, but there are a few observations that I would appreciate clarification on. Perhaps this could be done on Committee Stage. First, the new procedures relating to confiscation orders under section 7 to section 23 would mean the creation of a third way by which confiscation orders could be dealt with. We already have a system whereby a domestic confiscation can be granted or an international confiscation order can be transposed and a domestic co-operation order issued. Under this new Bill, the way in which an international confiscation order is dealt with will now be split in two. Provision will be made to deal with EU member state confiscation orders, and there will be a separate way of dealing with non-member-state confiscation orders. It does not appear that this Bill makes the system any more efficient or any clearer. In fact, it appears to create more bureaucracy. Why is this third method of dealing with confiscation orders necessary? What does this measure achieve that cannot be achieved through the processes currently in place? I also have a number of queries on the recovery of fines from other member states on which I would like the Minister to comment. I understand the need for fines to be collected on a cross-border basis, and indeed I support this. However, this is one of the areas of the Bill that may have human rights implications. How does the Minister envisage the appeal process working for an Irish citizen who has been fined abroad and wishes to challenge the fine? I will briefly mention another concern regarding data protection issues. Any data collected under the legislation should have to comply with our standards in this State and not those of any other member state. It goes back to the principle that sovereignty on justice issues must lie with the Irish people themselves. We do not want to see a situation whereby data shared in good faith, when it leaves the hands of another member state, is no longer under the standard under which it left Ireland. We simply cannot afford to see an abuse of power by governments in this area. As a party, we call not only for international co-operation on matters such as this, but also for a strong all-Ireland and all-island policing policy for these matters. The amendments being put forward in this Bill raise the same issues that were raised in 2008, particularly regarding human rights. The Irish Commission on Human Rights raised the issue of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in its submissions on the scheme of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Bill, and I believe the same issues apply to this Bill. In respect of the passing of data between member states relating to a person's alleged involvement in crime, we must always be mindful of how a balance is struck with a person's human rights under Article 8. We know from European case law that the storing of data relating to the private life of an individual in a register and the release of such information falls within the application of Article 8(1) of the ECHR. Therefore, in order for disclosure through mutual assistance to be considered necessary in a democratic society, the disclosure of such data must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In most criminal cases, I accept that this will be the case. However, there have been a number of cases in the past in which this was not the case, and a person's good name has been tarnished where that person was not guilty in the first instance. This is something of which we must be mindful. Sinn Féin supports the need to tackle cross-border crime, and for that reason we will support this Bill on Second Stage. I have outlined the concerns we have. We must always ensure that the provisions we adopt are fully compliant with human rights, and for that reason I look forward to the Minister's response to the issues I have raised."	spk_402
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-06-18	dail	31	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_16	The remarkable RTE documentary aired last Monday night exposed the full extent of collusion between British state forces and Unionist paramilitaries in the decades of the conflict. It was not just a case of a few bad apples; it was systemic. Agents of the British state controlled and armed Unionists and loyalist paramilitaries for all of those years. All parties in the House have called on the British Government to open the files on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. The Tánaiste tells us that the Taoiseach has raised this issue with the British Government but that it is not for turning. The British Government has also failed to honour its commitments in the Weston Park agreement and to have a proper and full independent investigation into the murder of Pat Finucane. The Tánaiste tells us that the Taoiseach has raised the matter with the British Government but that it is not for turning. For how long will the Government tolerate this? If the British Government presided over the murders of human rights lawyers and elected representatives in Scotland, can the Tánaiste imagine this being tolerated?  I raise the case of Councillor Eddie Fullerton. He was a much loved and respected member of Buncrana Urban District Council and Donegal County Council and assassinated in his home on 25 May 1991. His family has since been failed by the sheer apathy of those in power in this state. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of his family, we now know that an RUC special branch car took his killers across the Border that night. We also know that two of the guns used in the massacres at Castlerock and Greysteel were used in the murder of Eddie Fullerton.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-06-18	dail	31	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_16	The Tánaiste is right that all families deserve the truth. The difficulty is that the British Government and the British state have never accepted full responsibility for their full role in controlling, arming and directing Unionist paramilitaries throughout the decades of the conflict. That is the responsibility of the Government which is co-guarantor of all of the Agreements, from the Good Friday Agreement through to the Stormont House Agreement. Therefore, it is its responsibility. Can the Tánaiste imagine any other European jurisdiction where if a much loved elected representative was murdered by agents of another state, the government would pretty much sit on its hands for 24 years and accept it, despite the overwhelming evidence? Again, will the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach meet the family of Councillor Eddie Fullerton, listen to the latest update on their investigations and serious concerns and act on them? Furthermore, will they look at the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the case of Pat Finucane? Will they tell the British Government it must take full responsibility for its part in the conflict? Other groups have accepted responsibility and apologised for the hurt and pain they inflicted during those terrible years. The one party that is missing from the equation is the British Government. It is the responsibility of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to make it live up to its responsibilities and get to the truth for the families who are asking for it.	spk_118

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-06-17	dail	31	Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998: Motion	dbsect_39	At the same time every year, these motions come before the House and are opposed by Sinn Féin. Every year, we request that proper time be allocated to a debate on the motions but our requests are always denied and the motions are passed. This happens even though the legislation fundamentally undermines human rights, civil liberties and democratic life in this State. There is absolutely no basis for the continued use of draconian provisions such as these.The provisions up for renewal and, indeed, the Offences Against the State Acts in their entirety, have no place in the present or future of this island. We are living in a new political reality and there remains a duty on the Minister and the Government to live up to their obligations under the Good Friday Agreement to deliver security normalisation, something which the renewal of this Act does not help to deliver. The Government has certain obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. The Agreement places an onus on both governments to work towards the normalisation of the security apparatus here in the Twenty-six Counties and in the Six Counties. As every Member of this House will be aware, the Agreement was endorsed overwhelmingly by the majority of the people on this island. It needs to be protected and implemented in full. It is clear there is too much apathy among too many in the Opposition on this issue. Such apathy, coupled with the misguided and misplaced enthusiasm of others in the Oireachtas, has obvious negative implications for society. As Members of this Oireachtas, we all have an onus to uphold and implement the Good Friday Agreement in full. That is why Sinn Féin is calling on every Member to vote against this motion and to campaign for the repeal of the Offences Against the State Acts in their entirety. In the past, many Members have argued in favour of the provisions of the Acts because they have played a role. Today, I do not think anyone can truthfully argue that these provisions have a place in the present or future of this State. Sinn Féin believes the legislation is counter-productive in the long run. We live in a normal, law and order society, and normal policing is more than adequate to convict those who seek to undermine that law and order. There is no place in our society for the emergency legislation that was passed in 1998. The retention of this Act is an admission of the failure of this and previous Governments. Draconian legislation can never be a substitute for robust law and strong and accountable policing. Sinn Féin has always been in a minority in this House in recent years when we have rightly opposed the 1998 Act. I am sure we will be in a minority again today, but we are not in a minority internationally as we analyse this measure. The United Nations Human Rights Committee shares our stance on it. An Garda Síochána and the courts can convict and ensure those who carry out acts of violence in this day and age serve a proper sentence for those actions. It is our duty to make every attempt to convince so-called dissident groups to move away from violence, embrace peace and accept the will of the people as expressed in the Good Friday Agreement. We must also clearly explain and convince them of the opportunities the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process give republicans to further the republican and all-island agenda. That is where our focus for the next 12 months should be rather than seeking to mismanage the issue through outdated measures such as this Act. This is another reason I ask Members to oppose this motion. It is important to look at the issue of so-called dissident activities. In recent years, there has been virtually zero support for them. Unfortunately, considerable elements have resorted to criminality. In essence, they are criminals. They are involved in criminal activities to line their own pockets and enrich themselves. They are not republicans. This is not going to help bring about a new, united republic. They could not be further from being republicans. There may well be some among them who hold a republican view. In terms of those who are not involved in activities that enrich themselves, our challenge in these Houses is to engage with them and demonstrate the benefits of the peace process. The lack of leadership from this Government and the British Government in demonstrating the benefits of the peace process is the real issue here. Where are the economic benefits of the peace process for people living in working class areas, including Border counties like my own Donegal? What economic benefits have accrued? That is the message to defeat those who would engage in so-called dissident activities. These types of laws are self-defeating because they almost make martyrs of some people by avoiding due process. The real challenge for these Houses is to demonstrate to communities that are suffering economically or politically that there are real and tangible benefits from the peace process. Can we have a re-engagement by both Governments to deal with the outstanding issues from the past and give victims on all sides answers about what happened to their loved ones? I am mindful of the powerful documentary on Monday night, which for the first time on our State broadcaster demonstrated the role of the British state in co-ordinating the activities of loyalist paramilitaries from the 1970s. They reformed, controlled and armed those paramilitary organisations as well as directing them to the homes of republicans with intelligence and other forms of assistance. That occurred from the 1970s right through to the 2000s. Throughout all those years we never had a Government in this State that told the British Government it needed to take ownership of the full responsibility it had for directing those paramilitaries against the Nationalist community for all those decades. The British Government was a direct player in the conflict and arguably the most serious player, certainly in terms of the resources at its disposal throughout those decades. If that type of issue was dealt with robustly, it would send a message that the peace process is equal for all. Such action by our Government would do more to dissuade young people from joining these so-called dissident groups than the legislation which is before us again today. As an Irish republican, I stand ready to play my part and my party will play its part in helping that process at any stage. That is the challenge for us all. If one looks at the role of the British and Irish Governments in recent years, they seem to have been more interested in their own particular agendas than in driving through the peace process. There was a lack of engagement and support from the Government leading up to the current budgetary crisis in Stormont. The lack of leadership on the part of this Government is just not good enough. I reiterate the call made by my party's President, Deputy Adams, for the Taoiseach to engage directly with the British Prime Minister. As Members in this Chamber will be aware, Sinn Féin has consistently opposed the retention of this amendment. We have argued each year that it should be repealed in its entirety. At this time, there is neither a need for this legislation nor an argument in favour of it. I therefore call on people to vote accordingly and reject the motion. I now turn to the motion regarding the Criminal Justice (Amendment) 2009. Admitting that the ordinary courts are not adequate to deal individuals who are involved in organised criminal activity is a sad reflection on any government or state. In such circumstances, the state in question has failed to deal with issues like jury intimidation and witness protection. If we are serious about dealing with organised criminal gangs, we need to put resources in place, and especially resources for An Garda Síochána. I am sure those involved in organised criminal activity see the introduction of legislation to ensure they are tried before the Special Criminal Court as an admission of the State's failure to provide protections and safeguards to those who serve on juries. It is the wrong way to go and we will oppose this proposal for that reason. That is not flippantly to disregard the activities of these criminal gangs. We understand they cause misery and hardship and have no regard for law and order. If we examine best international practice, we will see that other countries have found more effective ways of dealing with organised criminal gangs that do not involve institutions like the Special Criminal Court. That court has been criticised by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Amnesty International and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for its procedures and for being a special court which ordinarily should not be used against civilians. Among the criticisms are the lack of a jury and the increasing use of the court to try organised ordinary crimes rather than the terrorist cases it was set up to handle. On the contrary, the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court is not restricted to offences related to the extraordinary circumstances which led to its establishment.There is information available which shows that an increasing number of cases that are not obviously related to offences against the State are being tried in the Special Criminal Court, largely as a result of the exercise by the Director of Public Prosecutions of the power to certify cases involving other than scheduled offences for trial in the Special Criminal Court. This is simply unacceptable. The Minister cannot argue for the retention of outdated legislation while at the same time implementing considerable cutbacks to An Garda Síochána and taking away its resources to combat criminality in communities throughout the State. There is a contradiction in the argument and for that reason we will oppose this motion.	spk_237
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-06-16	dail	31	Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill 2015: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_40	"I thank Deputies Coppinger, Higgins and Paul Murphy for introducing this important legislation. I welcome that the Government has indicated support for it. Like previous speakers, I appeal that it should not languish, awaiting Committee Stage. The Government has supported many Bills to proceed to Committee Stage, but they go to Room 101 and make no progress. This Bill is too important to go to Room 101. I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which sets out to amend the Employment Equality Act to ensure it cannot be used to discriminate against lesbian, gay and bisexual teachers on the grounds of a school's religious ethos. This has been an issue which has been widely debated, not least among those in our education sector and activists in the LGBT community. At the end of 2013, I remember reading the thorough submission made by GLEN to the Equality Authority on this issue. In preparing for this debate I revisited that submission. It is striking that there is need for such a submission in 2015. This section should have been amended years ago. At a time when Ireland has attracted global attention as a champion of LGBT equality, the Bill is another important stepping-stone in ensuring that Irish society is truly rid of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. We have, as a nation, voted with an overwhelming 62% to 38% majority, with just one constituency voting ""No"". It was a tremendous moment in our history, making us the first country in the world to vote for marriage equality. Collectively it was a great achievement for our people. Yet, in the classroom and workplace, outdated provisions such as section 37 mean that our LGBT teachers are still afraid that their sexual orientation will result in them being treated like second-class citizens. My party firmly believes that discrimination and intolerance should be challenged and stamped out wherever it exists. The old days of loopholes and shelters for any type of ignorance should be put behind us. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teachers have the right to have their private lives respected and we must repeal archaic loopholes that allow discrimination in the name of ethos as quickly as possible. We all believe teachers should be judged, employed and treated on the basis of their teaching ability alone. The ending of this legalised discrimination is about more than teachers, as was alluded to by a number of speakers. The weight of laws such as section 37 impresses upon gay, lesbian and transgender people the type of self-censorship which enables and propagates homophobia in general. Schools are where children form their identities, and learn and develop as individuals. It is paramount that our legislation and legal protections have tolerance, diversity and equality within them. The treatment of lesbian, gay and bisexual teachers can have a major bearing on how young gay people see themselves. Teachers are role models for schoolchildren and this is no less true of gay teachers. Young people coming to terms with their sexuality should feel comfortable in having gay role models as teachers. When young gay people see that their role models are being discriminated against, or even verbally bullied, they will be less confident and less comfortable in asserting their individual rights. Clearly it is incumbent on the Government to address section 37, a clause that has reinforced fears of discrimination against LGBT workers in religious-run institutions, particularly those employed in schools and hospitals.Its retention on the Statute Book makes it even more difficult for employees to be open about their sexuality. This is reflected in research published jointly in 2007 by the Equality Authority and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, which found the fear associated with section 37(1) has a significant, negative impact on lesbian, gay and bisexual teachers. The inclusion of this provision effectively forces teachers to avoid seeking employment in given sectors or to take up employment in conditions where they are compelled to conceal their sexuality. Removal of this provision will help to create a culture in schools in which homophobic bullying of teachers and students is no longer tolerated. If we are serious about combating homophobic bullying then we need to address section 37 and ensure no loophole remains in existing legislation that will allow discrimination in any shape or form. This is the society for which Ireland voted on 22 May. It is the Ireland that all of us in this House have a duty to reflect in the legislation we enact.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-06-12	dail	31	Water Services (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2014: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_2	I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for introducing this Bill. The issue of Irish Water and the unjust water tax has not gone away, nor will it. As much as the Government would like to sweep its failures and those of Irish Water under the carpet, the people are not going to let that happen, and there are failures. The Government has come under significant public pressure on the issue of water charges. It has been forced to introduce the proposed lower rates, which is not something that it wanted to do but about which it had no choice. The protests keep on coming. This is all because the situation reverts back to one basic right, namely, the human right of free access to the provision of clean, fresh water and an adequate sewerage system. Thankfully, the Bill allows us to debate this issue yet again and to give a voice to the hundreds of thousands of families that the Government so desperately tries to ignore. Election time will come, though, and ignoring the people will no longer be possible. We have heard a great deal of talk about democratic revolution, but there has been no such revolution in the Dáil. The democratic revolution is on the streets and at the ballot box by ordinary people who say that enough is enough. The continuing trends in the polls show this. Sinn Féin supports the need for the issues in this Bill to be debated. Therefore, we believe that it should be allowed to proceed to Committee Stage. The Bill has a number of points of merit although, obviously, some of them are now outdated, given the fact that it has been on the Order Paper for a while. First, there is no question but that the board of Irish Water, as a body that attracts so much public attention, should be subject to freedom of information requests. If the Government is stubborn enough to continue supporting the existence of Irish Water, the least it can do is afford the citizens of this State the courtesy of ensuring that the activities of the board are carried out in an open and transparent manner. I am glad that such requests can now be lodged.In regard to the establishment of a fully independent water services ombudsman to deal with the performance and operations of Irish Water, it goes without saying that he or she would be a busy ombudsman. Sinn Féin has called for Irish Water to come within the remit of the public service Ombudsman. We believe that this office is best placed to deal with such complaints and issues that arise.  Although Sinn Féin supports the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage, I support the comments made earlier by my colleague, Deputy Brian Stanley. Our party position is clear. In government, we would abolish Irish Water and scrap the water charges. The Bill before the House today provides that Irish Water be held in public ownership and be only transferred to private ownership or public-private partnership via a referendum. Sinn Féin believes this commitment needs to be stronger. There must be a referendum to enshrine public ownership of water into the Constitution. The right to water and for that service to be protected deserves constitutional protection. I note the proposed provision in this Bill relating to an insurance policy. Citizens have been turned into consumers by this Government. Therefore, the Government and Irish Water should have the courtesy of affording them the rights afforded to consumers. If this were the case, Irish Water should be responsible for the repair of leaks and the replacement of damaged infrastructure. I do not believe there is a need for an insurance-type system. What this farce has already cost the taxpayer to date is truly shocking. The spend on fixing leaks and replacing old pipes was measly compared to the amount wasted on the Irish Water call centre, consultants and other costs. An additional €539 million was also wasted on meters that are now redundant. The total amount wasted to date is approximately €800 million. Only €40 million was spent in each of the past four years on leaks and replacing pipes. Proper use of that €800 million would ensure double the mains replacement programme for 16 years. Imagine the difference that would make to water conservation. The Government needs to lead, to stop offering snivelling excuses and drop the line that it is all the fault of Fianna Fáil. It can start by allowing this Bill to pass Second Stage and, thus, allow proper, in-depth debate on Committee Stage. As I said earlier, although Sinn Féin will be supporting the passage of this legislation to Committee Stage, this does not take away from the fact that the whole concept of the imposition of household water charges is wrong and that the privatisation of public utilities, such as water, is even more so.	spk_52
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-06-12	dail	31	Direct Provision Report: Motion	dbsect_3	"I move:That Dáil Éireann shall consider the Report of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions entitled 'Report on the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman to cover all aspects and bodies associated with the Direct Provision System (DPS) and the extension of the remit of Freedom of Information to cover all aspects and bodies associated with the DPS including all the suppliers of goods and services, whether from the Private or Public Sectors', copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 7th May, 2015.I wish to express my appreciation on behalf of the committee for the opportunity to discuss the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions on the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman to cover all aspects and bodies associated with the direct provision system, DPS, and the extension of the remit of freedom of information to cover all aspects and bodies associated with the direct provision system, including all the suppliers of goods and whether from the private or public sectors. Ireland is the only EU member state without a single refugee or asylum seekers application process, a key reason the direct provision system is not fit for purpose. In terms of European directives, Ireland did not opt in to Directive 2003/9 which laid down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers. If Ireland had agreed to opt in to that directive, then Oireachtas approval would have been required. However, the Government decision not to opt in did not require any Oireachtas approval. When Directive 2003/8 was recast under a new directive, namely, 2013/33, and the Government again took the decision not to opt in, once again no Oireachtas approval was required. That is a gap, a lacuna, that needs to be addressed for the very simple reason that the policy environment in 2003 was vastly different to the policy environment today. Earlier this year, I met with counterparts from the Welsh Assembly, who said that petitions for a parliament or an elected assembly are often the canary in the coal mine, a metaphor for an early warning of serious danger ahead. It is a phrase that has remained with me over the course of detailed work on Ireland's direct provision system by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, which I have the privilege of chairing. In recent months, the committee has visited four direct provision centres nationwide and hosted a series of meetings in Leinster House on the topic. The resulting report on the direct provision system, which was published recently and is being debated today, is a canary in the coal mine moment. The report pulls no punches in criticising the application system for being unnecessarily complicated and lengthy. The current fractured process, which is responsible for the delays in issuing decisions, has been criticised by the European Union Court of Justice. It was a system that was designed and resourced to be a short-term solution, but given that one in five residents are in the direct provision system for seven or more years the direct provision system is no longer a short-term solution. That, and that alone, is more than sufficient to justify the statement that the system is utterly unfit for purpose. The heightened media coverage in recent months and resulting increase in public awareness of the inadequacies of the current system are to be welcomed. Our cross-party committee report adds weight to the emerging consensus on the grave deficiencies in the current system. The report finds the delay in processing the applications of residents is inexcusable, perpetrates inequality and ill treatment at a State level and leads to a systemic problem with the provision of public services. Another key finding is that the weekly allowances of €19.10 per adult and €9.60 per child, which have not changed since they were introduced 15 years ago, are insufficient, derisory and have been eroded to the point of being insulting to residents. We are calling for the allowance to be raised. Ordinary Irish citizens have access to the Ombudsman to advance concerns on public service delivery, while those in the direct provision system do not. We, therefore, have a section of Irish society being neglected and quite possibly being discriminated against because at a very basic human level they are being treated differently to other citizens in not having the system of which they are a part open to oversight. While the current system is in place, the respective jurisdictions of the Ombudsman for the public service and the Ombudsman for Children must be extended to include the direct provision system.We also call for the Freedom of Information Acts to be extended to include the direct provision system and the Reception and Integration Agency. Given that robust independent oversight is required, the Reception and Integration Agency should also establish a pre-Ombudsman independent complaints system for residents. Our cross-party committee also has particular concerns in relation to Ireland opting out of EU rules laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers. Only two countries in Europe have opted out - Ireland and Denmark. The reason Denmark opted out is that its legislation was stronger than the directive. It wanted stronger supports than were provided for in the directive. As I said, our committee is deeply concerned that the Oireachtas never had the opportunity to express its view on Ireland's approach to opting out of both Directive 2003/9 and Directive 2013/33. The directives compel member states to ensure that applicants have access to the labour market not later than nine months, and we are calling for the restriction on applicants' right to work to be lifted as soon as possible. Having visited four centres in Galway, Foynes, Mosney and Clondalkin, and heard first-hand the complaints of residents, the committee calls for greater access to health services and child care. Resident after resident pointed to access to appropriate health services, including mental health services, as a major issue. Therefore, we are calling on the Joint Committee on Health and Children to follow up on these concerns. We were particularly moved by the meetings with residents in the various centres. I am mindful that many of these residents have come from dreadful situations in their own countries. They have been traumatised and experienced God knows what. To have that trauma exacerbated by being stuck in what is essentially a prison, except that one can go for a walk outside every day and avail of services, for many years is unacceptable.  Ireland  I discovered earlier this year by reading a book that Ireland is the only country which today has a population that is less than in the early 1800s. All of us in these Houses know the reason for that. We have seen millions of our sons and daughters emigrate throughout the decades from the early 1800s through to today. In recent years, our sons and daughters and brothers and sisters travelled to Australia, Canada, Britain and the US. They were not asylum seekers but economic migrants. For our migrants in the US, the undocumented Irish, we seek to have their residency and status regularised. Of all the countries in Europe, I would have thought Ireland would be to the forefront not at providing an open door, because we cannot do that in the context of a European Union that does not and, therefore, we would invite to much of a demand, but at least have a system that reflects the decency of the Irish people and reflects our history of emigration.  One other statistic is from a book by Mr. Raymond Crotty in 1987. At that time, he revealed that of all the children born here since the foundation of the State through to 1987, about 65 years, half of those who survived childhood had emigrated. That is a shocking statistic. In rural communities, we are particularly aware of the devastating impact of the loss of our generations. I put that on the record as a reminder to all of us of why this failure is absolutely unacceptable and unsustainable moving forward and how it does not reflect the true character and the true values of the Irish people.  The sad reality for me is that the centres are out of sight and out of mind. I believe that if our people could meet these residents and look into the eyes of the men and women I met, which showed the despair they have about their situation, this would not be tolerated for one more day. This is a shame on our people. It does not reflect the true values of our people and it needs to stop as soon as possible.  As a parent, I am deeply disturbed when I think that one third of the 4,360 residents in the direct provision system are children. In the future, how will they regard our failure to stand up and say a wrong is being committed in the name of the people who elected us and we never said ""stop"". I express my appreciation to the members of the joint committee, to the clerk, Mr. Ronan Lenihan, who put a huge amount of work into the report and attended all the visits to the centres and deserves particular mention, and to the excellent committee secretariat staff who worked so hard. I ask that this report be regarded as the canary in the mine. Action is needed. There is a big difficulty with the direct provision system but the root cause is the need to have a single asylum or refugee application process."	spk_64

In respect of the initial speech, I appreciate that the Department would want to respond to a number of the recommendations in the report and give its perspective. This is, of course, its right. The responses show disputes between the interpretation of current legislation between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Ombudsman. The reason the committee undertook this report is the fact that one of our key responsibilities is to work with the Ombudsman to look at areas of concern. The previous Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, who is now the European Ombudsman, repeatedly raised concerns about the failure to extend her jurisdiction to include the direct provision centres. The current Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, outlined those concerns and raised them with the committee at a number of hearings. As part of its work, the committee also met with the Ombudsman for Children who also raised concerns about oversight. This was why we undertook the report. I note that following our recommendations, press statements were issued by both offices. The Ombudsman referred to the unambiguous independent oversight of that system, which is the key point. He used the word ""clarification"". I will read into the record the comments of the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, because they are even more important. In response to our report, he said:Every child in Ireland, regardless of their status, deserves the same protection with the same access to an independent complaints mechanism. One third of the 4,360 people currently residing in the Direct Provision System in Ireland are children (i.e. 1,453) and these children are being clearly discriminated against by failure to have any access to such a complaints process.He went on to say:The long-standing position of my Office is that the current exclusion to the investigatory remit of the Office in relation to the administration of the law regarding asylum and immigration relates only to decisions on status; my Office believes everything else - including issues regarding accommodation, administration processes and internal complaint handling - are in remit. However, the Department of Justice and Equality does not share this understanding. We have continually recommended that the Oireachtas put the matter beyond doubt and provide clear, unambiguous access for protection applicants to my Office.He concluded with the following:My Office aims to achieve systemic change through its investigatory work by tackling the root causes of the complaints we receive. Following this morning's recommendations by the Dáil PSOP Committee and the upcoming publication of the Report from the Working Group on Direct Provision there is now an opportunity to clarify the remit of the OCO so that my Office can fully investigate complaints related to the Direct Provision System in Ireland and by doing so, ensure that Ireland is on par with international best practice.I do not think the working group will adjudicate but it is important to engage with Department officials, possibly meet the two ombudsmen to see where they believe there is ambiguity and a lack of clarity and recommend that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform legislates for that. I know both offices are respected by these Houses, are independent and have the respect and trust of the citizenry.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's recommendations are as good a contribution, if not better, than what we have done. The commission, which is a body that is independent and respected by these Houses, pointed that the ombudsmen do not have appropriate oversight of the system. I welcome the fact that there will be change to the pre-Ombudsman complaints system within the House rules. There is a dispute concerning whether a complaint should go to that independent body before it goes to the Ombudsman. This is generally the case. The committee always says that the citizen should go through the complaints system available to them, regardless of whether it is the HSE or the council, to demonstrate that he or she utilised that system to try to get the concern addressed. It then goes to the Ombudsman when he or she has exhausted this route. This is known to be the case. The issue is whether an appropriate, respected system that is understood to be independent exists. Is information provided to residents in these centres? Is the Ombudsman advertised in all of these centres as a recourse if people have exhausted other avenues? Will there be posters with contact details for the independent complaints procedure? Can we make it completely accessible in all of these centres? They all have a central desk with information posters and residents' representative groups so it would be important that they are informed of their rights once the Ombudsman's role is clarified and strengthened in this regard.  The next point relates to HIQA. I note that the Reception and Integration Agency talks about an independent private body called QTS. That is not really good enough. It notes environmental matters and fire safety as well but there should really be a range of statutory agencies that can exercise oversight and inspect the centres. It has put in place an arrangement relating to an independent private company. I do not think the public would accept that for public services. This is why we have independent ombudsmen or inspection agencies. HIQA is a robust organisation. The matter needs to be looked at again. I will be challenging the Reception and Integration Agency and the Department about whether it is really appropriate for a private company to operate an inspection system rather than for it to be dealt with clearly through legislation and a robust statutory agency with a clear set of established standards. This depends on whether the system continues.  The response from Department officials that was incorporated in the Minister of State's speech is that freedom of information is pretty much covered already. The usual exclusionary provisions apply in respect of commercially sensitive matters. The Ombudsman, who is the freedom of information commissioner, clearly interprets that there is a need for him to cover all aspects of the system. For example, are the private companies which run these centres subject to freedom of information? They are being given public money to run these centres.Those who run the centres have been subjected to robust criticism but the committee found those who own and manage the centres we visited to be open, frank and concerned about the welfare of residents. We all agree that the system is not fit for purpose. The people who live in these centres are aggrieved and distressed, and that naturally leads to conflict. Anybody who deals with this cohort of people must manage conflict. It would be unfair if I did not acknowledge that the owners and managers of the centres we visited fully co-operated with the committee, answered all of our questions and provided us with full and open access. They also outlined their perspectives on these matters, which reflected their concern for the welfare of residents. The problem is the system rather the people who manage the centres, and that is what we need to reform. I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, has a genuine passion for equality and addressing the challenges that remain across the equality sector. I urge him to engage with the two ombudsmans' offices to clarify their remaining concerns so that they can be resolved through either legislation or changes to departmental rules. It is clear that the Department and the ombudsmans' offices disagree on these matters, but we need to resolve this as our next step. I am grateful for the opportunity to debate our report and thank those who contributed to the discussion. I look forward to studying the report of the working group and to the development of an application system that does not leave people to languish for years in these centres."	spk_71

Back in February of this year, it took Donegal's county registrar two hours and 29 minutes just to do a call-over of the motions list at Letterkenny courthouse - two hours and 29 minutes. That day, there were some 271 people facing repossession in just one court sitting in a Donegal court. The people affected by this crisis are ordinary people. They are constituents whom the Minister and I deal with every week. As my colleagues have alluded to already, a total of 351 homes have been repossessed or surrendered in this State during the first quarter of 2015 alone. These are ordinary people, kicked from their homes directly into hostels or other emergency accommodation and a homeless system that is not fit for purpose. What is happening to the mortgage holders of this State is scandalous.We have a situation in which banks, which came crawling with outstretched hands when they needed bailing out, are now failing the very people who were forced to do that bailing. The lack of gratitude is sickening. What is even more sickening is the Government's lack of initiative and its reluctance to embrace the change that is needed to solve this crisis for fear of upsetting the  In March of this year, the Minister for Finance had the gall to say that figures published by  Sinn Féin is providing a real, credible solution. It is a solution that provides the control that is needed to stop the continuous downward spiral. This is a solution that can have an immediate effect on lives filled with worry and fear - those people who face sleepless nights wondering whether a letter taking the roof from over their heads will be slipped through the letter box in the morning. For the first time, here is a Bill to provide for a legal process whereby the regulator can set a cap on the standard variable rate that the covered institutions can charge. The Minister for Finance would be able to prod the regulator to undertake a review, which could lead to a rate being set. He could ask for reports on the use of these powers and make regulations on how they can be used. It is a solution that gives the Minister and the Central Bank the real power to deal with this crisis. It is also a Bill designed for where we are today. Any cap to rates will lapse after 12 months unless the regulator renews it. After six months, a bank can make an appeal, which the regulator must consider. The legislation as a whole is designed to lapse at the end of 2017. This Bill is an extraordinary measure for extraordinary times. As my colleagues have all said, we cannot go on pretending we live in a normal banking environment. The banking sector is still a major drain on the economy. The banks must start playing their part in creating a fair recovery and the Government must, if needs be, have the power to make sure they do this. We cannot wait, as has been suggested by the Government, until the budget to deal with this crisis. The banks are ripping off mortgage holders, and inaction is not an option. I urge the Minister to reconsider his position and to have the decency to help those mortgage holders who are in trouble by making the banks fulfil their moral obligation to give something back. I am mindful that all those ordinary people, the hundreds who have gone before the courts in deep distress, are observing the situation with IBRC and Siteserv and the deals that are done for the wealthiest people in this State. They must be asking themselves, ""What in God's name is happening? Have we learned the lessons of the crisis that brought this State to its knees?""."	spk_512

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-06-09	dail	31	Draft Commission of Investigation (Certain matters concerning transactions entered into by IBRC) Order 2015: Motion	dbsect_29	It has been a remarkable number of weeks and it has been even more remarkable to hear Ministers, the Taoiseach and Government backbenchers downplaying the seriousness of the attempt by Denis O'Brien to silence our media in this State and prevent them from reporting a speech by Deputy Catherine Murphy in this Chamber. I took a look at the profile Denis O'Brien likes to give to the world. It is a profile from his Digicel Group and it states that he founded Digicel in 2001 and that it operates in the Caribbean and in Haiti, which I will go into in more detail; that he founded the Esat Telecom Group and built it throughout the 1990s until its sale to British Telecom for €2.4 billion; that he chaired the Special Olympics World Summer Games; and that he is a special ambassador for Haiti. That is the image he wishes to project to the world. In terms of Haiti, Digicel represents the biggest external investment of any company he owns. Jean-Bertrand Aristide was the first democratically elected president of the people of Haiti in 1990. Within a year, he was driven out of office in a coup, backed by the Bush Administration in the United States. He later came back into his country but was forced out again. Throughout that period, the will of the IMF and of western corporate interests was enforced upon the people of Haiti. They were forced to privatise their resources and to resist policies such as the introduction of a minimum wage and so on, of which Aristide was strongly in support. Then in came the bould Denis O'Brien and he invested in that type of opportunity, created by profoundly anti-democratic practices, following two separate coups which removed a democratically elected president. Yet he was able to present himself as the champion of the people of Haiti when they were impacted by the earthquake.  In Ireland, when he sold Esat to BT and made a fortune out of the sale, he was able to walk away from having to pay capital gains tax by taking up Portuguese residence, and now he is in Malta, but what did we do in Ireland? We made him chairman of the Special Olympics. We had him in front of the world as our moral leader. That is what we have done again and again with Denis O'Brien.  We have a culture of fear in our media, mostly in this city, where people are afraid to utter a word for fear they will have a lawyer's writ on their desk the next morning. It is that culture of fear that made Denis O'Brien believe, having seen the back of people such as Sam Smith and having attempted to silence people such as Elaine Byrne, that he could silence this House. It is no wonder he believed that, because every time he did what he did we promoted him as a goodwill ambassador, a human rights ambassador, a moral leader for our people. I hope that thanks to the decision in the High Court, which was predictable, this is a turning point. How any solicitor could have advised a media company not to report or how the Constitution could be interpreted in any way other than that Dáil privilege is absolute and can be reported upon is remarkable. I hope that we will start to send a clear message to our people. Hundreds and hundreds of families are before the courts in cases involving the repossession of their homes, yet they are reading about Denis O'Brien getting favourable interest rates and being able to purchase Siteserv in the way that it happened while being the wealthiest person in Ireland.He is wealthier than major international figures, with an estimated €6.8 billion, but he was getting favourable deals as if he was about to go bankrupt. This is what the people at home are sickened about. I hope that all the bullying and intimidation our journalists in this city have been put under can come to an end once and for all and that we can have a true narrative about Mr. Denis O'Brien that his powerful friends would seek not to have. He wishes to portray a profile of his company but, in the fullness of time, his will not be a memory among our people that he would like to it to be. I hope his reign will soon come to an end in this State and that we can have a properly functioning democracy as well as a properly functioning media that feel they can report accurately what happens, hold big business to account and deal with white collar crime in order that we can cleanse ourselves of the culture that has bankrupted and crippled our State and our people.	spk_360

Garda Síochána officers, to whom I have spoken over recent years, have told me there is an issue in terms of a meritocracy over recruitment.

We need better oversight not just of the appointment of assistant commissioners up to the Commissioner but also to include promotions to the level of sergeant, inspector, superintendent and chief superintendent - from the very bottom to the very top.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-05-26	dail	31	Human Rights Issues	dbsect_3	The difficulty is that the legislation does not address the appointment of sergeants to the position of superintendent and, possibly, chief superintendent. That is where there is a big issue. I submitted ten questions to the Minister six months ago. Her response at the time was that she would refer them to the Garda Commissioner, but I have yet to receive responses to them. My concerns are around the level of oversight by the Department and, soon I hope, the police authority of the entire promotions process in An Garda Síochána. In the context of the debate on reform, this needs to happen from the bottom up, including how people are promoted, with independent oversight. I have concerns about this issue, as reflected in my questions. I ask that they be responded to as soon as possible. My second concern relates to the independent adjudicator, an issue we dealt with in the context of the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill. If the police authority asks questions of An Garda Síochána and it responds that it cannot provide information for security reasons, an independent adjudicator, namely, a judge, rather than the Minister, should oversee the process so as to remove any accusation of a Minister being too close to the Garda and so on.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-05-26	dail	31	Human Rights Issues	dbsect_3	If one reads Article 2 with Article 1, there is a broader challenge for the State. I will use as an example the case of Mr. Seamus Doherty who was murdered in Donegal in 2012. I have raised this case previously with the Minister at Question Time. In recent days Mr. Doherty's daughter, Caitriona, was in contact with me. She is on the verge of taking legal action against a range of bodies. She cannot have the coroner's hearing dealt with or apply to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal because the investigation is still live. She made a complaint to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission about the conduct of the investigation and the serious questions that arose in respect of it. However, the ombudsman can only refer cases to the Garda Commissioner with an opinion on whether disciplinary action is required. She cannot get answers two years after the murder because of the way the system has been designed. Many coroners are critical about the need to update the Coroners Act 1962. The bereaved next of kin of victims are suffering indignities for several years as they try to get answers and, in some cases, challenging the State agencies tasked with carrying out investigations. Radical reform is required. I ask the Minister and her departmental officials to pay heed to the hearings of the Oireachtas committees and examine the issues brought to our attention.	spk_41
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-05-26	dail	31	Human Rights Issues	dbsect_3	The other case that has led me to pursue this matter is that of Jake McGill-Lynch who in 2013 tragically took his life with a weapon in his own home. His family have been pursuing the issue of whether medication could have had an impact on his mental health that led to that scenario. It is devastating for this family, too, who are locked in a process through the coroner's system. The coroner's oversight is very limited when people question how the HSE or doctors dealt with their deceased family members. This poses a big challenge and, in fairness, it will take some time to address. I ask the Minister to be aware of the fact that many families have suffered a double bereavement of loss and then feel they are not getting justice for their loved ones. The system chugs along, yet never quite gives them the answers they need.	spk_43

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-05-26	dail	31	Human Rights Issues	dbsect_8	If one reads Article 2 with Article 1, there is a broader challenge for the State. I will use as an example the case of Mr. Seamus Doherty who was murdered in Donegal in 2012. I have raised this case previously with the Minister at Question Time. In recent days Mr. Doherty's daughter, Caitriona, was in contact with me. She is on the verge of taking legal action against a range of bodies. She cannot have the coroner's hearing dealt with or apply to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal because the investigation is still live. She made a complaint to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission about the conduct of the investigation and the serious questions that arose in respect of it. However, the ombudsman can only refer cases to the Garda Commissioner with an opinion on whether disciplinary action is required. She cannot get answers two years after the murder because of the way the system has been designed. Many coroners are critical about the need to update the Coroners Act 1962. The bereaved next of kin of victims are suffering indignities for several years as they try to get answers and, in some cases, challenging the State agencies tasked with carrying out investigations. Radical reform is required. I ask the Minister and her departmental officials to pay heed to the hearings of the Oireachtas committees and examine the issues brought to our attention.	spk_41
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-05-26	dail	31	Human Rights Issues	dbsect_8	The other case that has led me to pursue this matter is that of Jake McGill-Lynch who in 2013 tragically took his life with a weapon in his own home. His family have been pursuing the issue of whether medication could have had an impact on his mental health that led to that scenario. It is devastating for this family, too, who are locked in a process through the coroner's system. The coroner's oversight is very limited when people question how the HSE or doctors dealt with their deceased family members. This poses a big challenge and, in fairness, it will take some time to address. I ask the Minister to be aware of the fact that many families have suffered a double bereavement of loss and then feel they are not getting justice for their loved ones. The system chugs along, yet never quite gives them the answers they need.	spk_43

Sinn Féin supports the proposed amendment to the Constitution. A total of 85% of the members of the Constitutional Convention voted in favour of amending the Constitution to strengthen the protection of economic, social and cultural rights, and a majority of the convention voted for a constitutional provision along the lines put forward in this Private Members' Bill. Sinn Féin proposed a bill of rights amendment in its submission to the Constitutional Convention, having appropriate regard to the Good Friday Agreement - Strand Three, Part 6, paragraph 9. The Constitutional Convention was required by its Oireachtas mandate to have ""appropriate regard"" to the Good Friday Agreement in its deliberations. Strand Three, Part 6 - Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity, paragraph 9 of the Good Friday Agreement describes the obligation on the Irish Government to take ""comparable steps"" to the establishment of a bill of rights for the North. The British-Irish Agreement of 1998 to which the Multi-Party Agreement is annexed, together forming the Good Friday Agreement, is an inter-state treaty with binding effect on the Irish Government under international law, as recognised by the Irish courts. The Irish Government has a clear obligation under the terms of Strand Three of the Good Friday Agreement, at Part 6 also known as ""Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity"", to introduce additional constitutional protections and human rights guarantees. Under the heading, ""Comparable Steps by the Irish Government"", it states:The Government will, taking account of the work of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and the Report of the Constitution Review Group, bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights. These proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, and other international legal instruments in the field of human rights ... The measures brought forward would ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland.While some of the additional human rights related comparable steps described later in paragraph 9, such as the establishment of a human rights commission, the adoption of enhanced equality legislation and so forth, were met relatively soon afterwards, as was the obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights in some way into domestic law, the primary constitutional reform aspect of its terms remains to be fulfilled 15 years later. Constitutional change to improve the situation is required, involving comparable steps in both jurisdictions. In current terms, applying the logic of the Part 6 assessment, neither the Human Rights Act 1998, incorporating the ECHR, in the North nor Articles 40 to 44 of the 1937 Constitution plus the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 in the South provides the complete protections indicated in paragraphs 4 and 9, nor can the other international human rights treaties ratified by the two governments do so, as most of these still have neither constitutional status nor even status in domestic law, North or South. When read in light of the equivalence obligation set out at paragraph 9, what Part 6 indicates is that what is therefore needed, but remains outstanding in both jurisdictions, is a comprehensive bill of rights that incorporates but also goes beyond the ECHR rights. Sinn Féin believes that the Oireachtas should authorise a fresh mandate for the Constitutional Convention specific to this purpose. The 1937 Constitution is now more than 75 years old. At the time of its adoption, it was undoubtedly one of a handful of constitutions that helped set the world standard for protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. However, over successive decades its provisions, and the conservative interpretation of them by the Irish courts, have often fallen short of the mark in this regard. Today, the Constitution struggles to keep pace with our evolving sense of rights and wrongs. Indeed, there will be a vote on Friday on one of those matters that will hopefully strengthen our Constitution in terms of equality. Almost 20 years ago, the leading experts of the Government appointed Constitution Review Group made a thorough assessment of Articles 40 to 45 that set out the fundamental rights of Irish people. Its final report recommended approximately 50 amendments that were required to bring these constitutional provisions up to contemporary standards. Unfortunately, with only a few exceptions, these were never acted upon by the Government of the day or by any government since then. While the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution stated its intent to proceed with this overhaul of the fundamental rights provisions, that work had barely begun before the committee was dissolved. There is consequently no question that these constitutional provisions are still in need of amendment to ensure that all citizens can be fully guaranteed treatment with respect and dignity, can be better protected from abuse of power, can hold the State to account for its actions or inaction and get redress for wrongdoing on the part of the State. We maintain that consideration of a bill of rights amendment which could treat this matter systematically and comprehensively is both an implied obligation and a logical approach. In addition to the obligations under the Good Friday Agreement that I have outlined, there are five main reasons that a bill of rights amendment would benefit Irish citizens and, therefore, deserves consideration. First, Articles 40 to 44 on fundamental personal rights are not enough. It is true that Articles 40 to 44 protect an important subset of fundamental rights, but their provisions are far from complete. For example, while they contain many civil and political rights, they do not contain most economic, social and cultural rights.The question is not whether Articles 40 to 44 provide any protection; it is whether they provide sufficient protection of all the fundamental rights recognised in the 21st century as well as the equivalent protection required under the Good Friday Agreement. The answer to that question is ""No"". According to the Constitution Review Group, ""experience ... has demonstrated that Articles 40-44 contain flaws and are in need of revision"" not least because ""the list of rights expressly protected by the Constitution is, by contemporary standards, incomplete"" and ""it is scarcely satisfactory that [certain important rights do] not receive general constitutional protection"". That is why the review group recommended almost 50 amendments to these articles, some of which are extensive. In addition, Article 45 on directive social principles has been rightly criticised for describing another subset of fundamental rights but at the same time stipulating that these rights cannot be the subject of constitutional litigation. In other words, they cannot be enforced by citizens. This is not satisfactory. A comprehensive bill of rights amendment can remedy these identified deficiencies and bring Ireland's constitutional protections back into line with international best practice. Second, the unenumerated rights model disadvantages citizens. It is true that the courts have interpreted the Constitution and Article 40 in particular to include some additional unenumerated rights. This is welcome. There is certainly room under its current provisions for a more progressive Judiciary to go even further, as the Indian judiciary has done in interpreting very similar clauses. This means the extent of our rights under the Constitution remains largely under judicial control and subject to judicial discretion, as pointed out by the Constitution Review Group. The unenumerated rights model is fine for lawyers and judges, but it is not great for citizens. The Constitution is not just for legal professionals; it is the citizens' contract with the State. It sets out what the State is permitted to do, is required to do and is prohibited from doing. It is an important tool that citizens can use to hold the State to account, to get justice when the State acts wrongly or fails to act when it should and to vindicate their fundamental rights. Average citizens should know and clearly understand their constitutional rights, rather than having to guess what they are or needing specialised legal knowledge and expertise to interpret the basic meaning of provisions. Understanding the content of the Constitution, especially the provisions it makes on fundamental and other constitutional rights, should not be the preserve of judges and lawyers alone. A bill of rights amendment could help provide clarity and certainty in a way that is accessible and meaningful to the average person. This is, in effect, what the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights did. It gathered together all the EU-recognised rights, including the unenumerated rights that had been confirmed through judicial decisions of the European Court of Justice with a view to making these rights more transparent for citizens for the ultimate purpose of enhancing their enforcement, in a single accessible document. Third, ordinary equality and human rights legislation is not enough. While the enhanced corpus of equality and human rights legislation, such as the Equal Status Acts and the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, is very welcome - indeed, it was one of the benefits of the Good Friday Agreement we gained here in the South - ordinary legislation is not enough to provide sufficiently robust and durable guarantees of these equality and other human rights. Without constitutional protection, a future Government could simply repeal this legislation if it so decides. In contrast, constitutional provisions such as those contained in a bill of rights provide a more permanent guarantee and can only be repealed by the Irish people. The fact is we need both the Constitution and a future comprehensive bill of rights within or attached to it to provide the core guarantees and the avenue for judicial remedies for violations of these rights. The much more detailed legislation provides a necessary framework for implementation of these rights and can provide for both non-judicial and quasi-judicial remedies short of the courts. The two structures play different but complementary roles. Fourth, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights does not provide sufficient extra protection. The charter applies in relation to domestic incorporation and implementation of EU law only. Even so, many of its provisions are made subject to domestic law. While it is welcome - indeed, it was the only part of the Lisbon treaty supported by Sinn Féin - it is not enough. Fifth, the piecemeal approach of individual additional or amending clauses is not enough. The Constitutional Convention has considered to some extent amendments to protect the equal rights of women, LGBT people and children. It is welcome that it has recommended some important changes that are long overdue, but the two referendums that are taking place this week represent no more than piecemeal reform. It will be fantastic if the Irish people vote in favour of marriage equality on Friday, as I hope they will. I would like to see the other referendum passing as well to ensure people under the age of 35 can attempt to become President of Ireland. I am mindful of the famous painting of Michael Collins that hangs in the foyer of this building. Michael Collins would not have been able to run for President of Ireland under the constitutional provisions that are in place today. This week's referendums do not amount to more than a piecemeal approach. We need the more comprehensive and complete overhaul that would be represented by a bill of rights. Unquestionably, these groups of citizens need and deserve unambiguous constitutional protections. Other groups in Irish society need these protections too because they remain potentially vulnerable to certain abuses. Piecemeal reform is not good enough. A comprehensive bill of rights amendment could ensure everyone gets the constitutional guarantees and protections they need. The adoption of a comprehensive bill of rights amendment would give our fundamental human rights, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, a more central place in the Constitution. This would better reflect the ethos and aspirations of Ireland in the 21st century. I would like to conclude by commending the two Deputies who have proposed this Private Members' Bill and facilitated this evening's debate. We support the amendment to the Constitution they have proposed. My party would argue that we need to go much further than a simple amendment to the Constitution. We need a comprehensive bill of rights. It can be argued that it should be attached to the Constitution, as is the case internationally. We believe the Oireachtas should reconvene the Constitutional Convention to examine that matter. It should work with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and all the other stakeholders. Until we reach that point, regardless of who is in government we will continue to have debates in here about injustice and the failure to defend citizens' rights. That is our call. We will engage with Governments and with our colleagues in this House until we get to that point."	spk_345
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-05-07	dail	31	Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_21	The Bill before us amends the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 by creating three new offences in order to give effect to two Council Framework Decisions from 2008 and 2002. These offences, as we all know, are public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. I and my party broadly support this Bill but we have some concerns about it. I am conscious that the Government is implementing a European directive but there several points contained within the Bill that we are concerned about and are seeking clarification or reassurance from the Minister on. Why has it taken the Government so long to transpose this? It seems highly unusual that the transposition of something like this would take such a long time. Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Murphy, can explain this to the House or ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to respond on Committee Stage or later. Our main concern regarding this Bill is the definition of terrorism as it is formulated in the Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA. It is a very broad definition which could include virtually every act that has some element of organisation or planning. This seems unworkable and something we would be quite concerned about. By reiterating the framework decision definition, the Bill legitimately raises the question whether this instrument has a built-in function creep in order not only to combat terrorism, but to extend the definition in such a manner as to cover most public order situations and more common criminal acts as they apply under national law. While there is a definite need for cross-border co-operation in this area, even international co-operation, criminal sanctions and definitions should be solely the realm of the member state. We do not want to hand over this type of power to Europe. Such issues are for member states alone to deal with. We do not want to see the EU become involved in this area of our citizens’ lives. We would like to see greater checks and balances contained within the Bill to ensure there is no such function creep in this area. To deal with the threat from the dark net, it is not all bad. There are human rights activists and journalists in some countries who need to protect themselves from very dangerous regimes and need something that could not be monitored in order for them to communicate and tell the stories of their communities. It can be a benign force. However, it has also been used by very dangerous criminals and issues such as child abuse are a real concern. I have raised with the Minister the poor resourcing of the Garda computer crime investigation unit's information technology equipment and its capacity to conduct forensic examination. We need to ensure that An Garda Síochána is resourced and has the most up to date equipment possible to combat this threat. We need to make sure that people engaged in serious criminality, organised criminal gangs and paedophile rings, who pose a threat to our communities, have nowhere to hide and there is nothing in the Internet they can use as some kind of haven for their heinous activities. To combat that we need to resource An Garda Síochána properly.The milestone Garda Inspectorate reports into the investigation of crime, which were carried out over three years, contained very serious criticism of the IT equipment within An Garda Síochána so I wanted to avail of this opportunity to draw attention to that as a real challenge. I want to briefly mention another concern, namely, data protection issues. Any data collected under this legislation should have to comply with standards in this State and not those of any other member state. We do not want to see a situation where data shared in good faith leaves the hands of another member state and is no longer under the standard at which it left Ireland. We simply cannot afford to see an abuse of power by governments in this area. The clearest example of this in recent years was the case of Frank McBrearty from my county of Donegal. He tried to enter the US with his family and was refused entry by the US authorities because according to US immigration records, he had a conviction for assault despite the fact that the conviction had been overturned and he was found to be innocent of the charges levelled against him. This case raises very serious concerns and questions about how data on individuals is retained in this State and exchanged with agencies from other jurisdictions. This is something we will seek to strengthen on Committee Stage of this Bill. The challenge with all these measures in the area of justice and protecting our citizens from real threats is that we must strike a balance between a state's responsibility for security with civil liberties. We want to ensure that any of the powers being introduced do not impinge on civil liberties and are not used to spy on law-abiding citizens who challenge the Government and foreign policies. We know in this House that there is grave concern about the use of Shannon Airport by the US military in the theatre of war in Iraq, a war that was not sanctioned by the UN. We have concerns about the tolerance of the Israeli regime and how it essentially imprisoned millions of Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank and keeps stealing land. An appalling government has been formed there and its approach to settlements is very worrying. There are many regimes we tolerate or co-operate with under the guise of the EU which are a concern for the Irish people. We need to ensure that we have a balanced approach and that we protect our citizens from real threats. All of us are appalled by the development of Islamic State and reject utterly that creed which is an insult to the honourable people who follow the Muslim faith in Ireland and across the world. It is an honourable faith and I have huge respect for many people who adhere to the Islamic faith. We need to get that balance right in terms of the civil rights and liberties of our citizens and those across the EU versus a state's need for security mechanisms.  I will wrap up by mentioning the need for consistency. If we tolerate the Israeli regime and what it has done in Palestine and what is happening in Egypt, we send out a signal to young Muslims in the Middle East. In Egypt, the former government has been locked up and sentenced to death and an Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa, is locked up there. When we tolerate these regimes and co-operate with them, we send a message to young people that radicalises them and allows them to fall into the hands of the very organisations we seek to protect our citizens from. We need consistency in foreign policy and courage from our Government. One step we can take very soon is to recognise the state of Palestine. The two Houses of the Oireachtas have asked for this to happen and our Government needs to ensure it happens. If we are consistent in our approach to human rights internationally and if we live up to some of the great names who have come before us - Irish leaders who have advocated for human rights across the globe - we are in a strong position to confront the terrorist threat and extremists out there. That is my plea.	spk_298

As the Minister of State will be aware, there are staff in the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council who are already dealing with complaints mechanisms and are skilled in this area. As a result of the establishment of the new regulatory authority, their positions will become redundant. There is precedence in terms of ensuring that the establishment of a new body does not result in job losses. That is the objective of these three amendments. During discussions on earlier Stages of the Bill I received reassurance first from the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, and then from the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, the Government would be sympathetic to these issues and would try to ensure current skilled staff who are relevant, who could help to get the new authority up and running smoothly and who would have a lot to offer to the authority are retained. I accept there will be some degree of training required and new corporate management structures to be put in place and so on but the hope is that as few people as possible will be made redundant and that there will be no re-inventing of the wheel when there are people available who have worked in this field and can bring an awful lot to a new authority. I hope the Minister of State will be able to accept these amendments."	spk_112

What the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, stated about amendment No. 40 is encouraging. Of course, there will be human resources challenges, pensions issues and such changes, but undoubtedly there would be a desire on the part of the Law Society and the Bar Council that the professional staff who work for them would continue to be in employment. If the same will was on the side of the Government and the relevant Departments, I believe that this can be facilitated. It is common sense and it is also just and fair. There is no question regarding the professionalism or integrity of those who have worked in this sphere and it would be great to have that pool of skills available to a new authority.  If the Government is indicating that it will bring forward amendments in the Seanad that would facilitate this, I will withdraw the amendment in good faith. I do so only on the basis that when this comes before the Seanad, there will be a firm proposition on the table rather than a sense that it is being worked on. With respect, they have had a long time to work on this matter. I am disappointed that there is not a firm proposal today, stating clearly that this issue is being addressed.

I will set out a relevant example for amendment No. 44. Not long ago, the former Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Brian Purcell, came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. He restrained himself from giving evidence because of matters now subject to investigation by the Fennelly commission. I am concerned that the Bill as currently worded could allow a broad opportunity for someone not to appear before an Oireachtas committee to give account. It could limit the ability of a committee to work. Obviously, if someone came before an Oireachtas committee and explained that because of legal privilege and matters subject to decision by a court he cannot give evidence, the committee would have to accept that, as we did, reluctantly, in the case of Brian Purcell. However, I am concerned that the wording is a little too broad and too open to interpretation. It may limit the ability of the Oireachtas justice committee or any committee to hold a body to account. That body may be independent but it is funded by the taxpayer and plays an important role on behalf of the public. That is my concern.	spk_121

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-04-22	dail	31	Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011: Report Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_16	There has been a fair degree of change in the area of multidisciplinary practices since Deputy Alan Shatter was Minister. He was gung-ho about them, even though it was pointed out to him that they could create an elitist approach to accessing law. Some of the more talented barristers would be sucked up into one building, and there would be issues of oversight, with accountants, solicitors and barristers operating from one building. It could be argued that ethical issues might arise.  The Minister of State is from Cork and I am from Donegal. My major concern is about somebody in one of those counties, which are far removed from the large legal firms in cities, who is facing a difficult case involving corporate, environmental or family law. Under the current regime, such a person would go to his or her local solicitor, who would consider the pool of barristers available and try to find a specialist to argue the case. In a sense, that created a level playing field. Multidisciplinary practices are on the way out in many countries. One thinks of Hollywood movies in which the best and brightest graduate from university and are head-hunted by large legal firms and paid large amounts of money, and the balance is swayed in favour of big business. Those who can afford to pay the most can attract the best and brightest, whereas an ordinary citizen cannot access such services.  Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, is an advocate for affordable, fair and balanced access to justice. The Bar Council and the Law Society have views, but those organisations which are advocates for citizens as much as for the legal fraternity are particularly important. We have a new Minister. I am concerned that this idea was Deputy Shatter's brainchild. He was on a crusade in terms of his views on the legal fraternity, particularly barristers. The Minister has introduced a six-month period of research followed by a six-month period of consultation, and perhaps after all that she will make changes. She could instead have got rid of the thing. Why is what I hope will be the inevitable being delayed by a year? I would like an explanation of the approaches taken. International evidence, with the exception of one example given by the previous Minister, Deputy Shatter, shows clearly that this is not the way to go, and it is not something that people in Ireland are demanding.

Earlier when the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, was in the Chamber, I stated I was disappointed that the idea of multidisciplinary practices, which emerging international best practice tells us is not the way to go, was not being scrapped. It was the previous Minister's brainchild and there is no demand for multidisciplinary practices coming from the Irish people. I do not know of any Deputy who has been lobbied that what we need in the area of justice is multidisciplinary practices, where we have the best and brightest accountants, solicitors and barristers in the one building and where those with the most money can access them. The current system works with regard to access. Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, has pointed out its concerns that citizens will not be able to access through their solicitors the array of barrister expertise that they now can. The Minister has put before us six months of research and consultation and she will have the latitude to make a call. I ask her to scrap this and give up Deputy Alan Shatter's brainchild. She is a new Minister with a fresh set of ideas and I ask her to abandon these multidisciplinary practices and maintain the system we have. People are demanding many other reforms, such as a real reduction in the cost of accessing justice and legal practitioners, and the mediation Bill, which is long overdue. This idea of multidisciplinary practices should be scrapped. There is no need or demand for them. They have proven not to be in the best interests of citizens internationally. Very few good case studies argue for them. I ask the Minister to please scrap these multidisciplinary practices and let us not have a year of wasted time.	spk_393

This Bill has dragged on for a number of years and there has been extensive input from various stakeholders around the make-up of the new authority. The amendment reflects the perspective I have heard from key stakeholders. There is a range of experience, and there should be a balance of people from the legal fraternity and people from the lay fraternity who have relevant expertise and who could make a real contribution. In terms of a new dispensation and giving the new authority a clear, strong, independent footing from the beginning, but also having representation from the legal fraternity, this is a better proposition than that offered initially by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter.	spk_361

If she is arguing that ICTU and IBEC do not need to be there because it is not a social partnership model, why would she exclude organisations such as the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and the Northside Community Law Centre, which are not-for-profit organisations that are advocates? Why not widen the participation of those organisations? While I welcome the inclusion of IHREC, there is a deficit. Given that the Bill will also go before the Seanad, the Minister could consider widening the board to 13 and making provision for a number of those advocacy groups. If the Minister cannot accept the amendment here and how, I ask her to reflect on it. Although the Legal Aid Board is included, the omission of FLAC and ICCL is serious. I ask the Minister to reconsider it.	spk_363

One of the challenges for the legal fraternity in terms of its reputation is to look increasingly at its role as an advocate for citizens in terms of their rights and to ensure there is affordable access to the legal system and a change in how we conduct law in this country from the archaic, very expensive and, arguably, elitist judicial system, as some people perceive it. I have much admiration for people in the legal fraternity, but there are perceptions, which are sometimes the reality, about how the system has worked. It is a serious omission. The Minister could easily increase the number on the board to 13, an argument I made to the Minister's predecessor, and provide a place at the table for organisations such as the Free Legal Advice Centres, which are strongly respected, the ICCL and other groups that are champions or advocates for the citizen and that challenge all of us in terms of how the administration of justice works. Having people of that calibre on the authority could only strengthen it. They would be alternative voices. I ask the Minister to consider seriously the error of not including them on this board for the sake of two extra places. The Minister argues that ICTU and IBEC need not be on the authority because it is not a social partnership model, and I reluctantly accept that point. However, I do not understand why she cannot include the advocacy organisations that are so respected in the community and that could bring a dynamic to the authority that does not exist based on the current membership.	spk_365

It appears that most Members in these Houses advocate for these matters, but they are not popular issues. We are doing something wrong, and the best way to deal with that is to put in place concrete actions and measures to combat the views out there.	spk_57

There is a concern that this may reflect resource limitations. Are there grounds for bringing together the Garda Commissioner and the head of the Prison Service to address these issues? I accept some of these rejections may well be legitimate. Are they purely made on a security basis or do they reflect resources use?	spk_75

We discussed this at length on Committee Stage and I appreciate that the Minister has put in an amendment to strengthen the area of statutory declarations. This is a serious debate and organisations such as Treoir have been to the forefront in highlighting the issue. There is inequality as between a father and a mother as things stand. There must be thousands of fathers out there who did not realise when they registered their name on the child's birth certificate that it did not automatically entitle them to guardianship. One third of children are born to mothers who are not married, many of whom are very young and even teenagers. We always tell young men to step up to the plate, to be a father, be a man and pay their maintenance. We tell them to be there for their child and to support their child, even if they are not going to continue in a relationship with the mother. Without this legislation being enacted, we will not have equality as a father's right to guardianship is subject to the consent of the mother. This makes it an unequal relationship. When a man proudly registers his name, he will be advised that it confers no entitlement to guardianship and that he should seek the agreement of the mother to a statutory declaration. If the mother disagrees, however, it will end up in court. I appreciate that this provides a measure of safety but we should devise a system where people do not go down the road of going to court on these matters. The registrar should be able to give the necessary information from the get-go. The fact that a father is there means he wants to be there and wants to fulfil his responsibilities. It is unfortunate that, with so many men walking away from their responsibilities, when a man actually turns up to accept his responsibility and wants his name on the register he cannot have equality. The point is sometimes made that in many cases men are not really equal parents because they do not share the parenting responsibilities. Then there are the cases of domestic abuse and where a man who is not really a fit father likes the idea of calling himself a father without what comes with it and it is for these cases that there is an option to go to court.  This Bill is very welcome and long overdue. The difficulty is that until we have reform of family law, a mediation Bill and investment in the court system we will have the spectacle of separated parents in packed courtrooms across the State, with all the stress that goes with that. We will not have equality between a father and a mother, particularly in cases where a father steps up to the plate. I do not think conditionality in the form of residency - what I have called ""the co-habitance clause"" - is fair because sometimes a father cannot live with a mother. The mother may live with her parents if she is very young, or maybe the father has to work away from home so cannot comply with the need to live with her for three months after the child is born and nine other months. It is unfortunate we have that requirement and I cannot agree to it so I will press my amendment today. I do not assume I will get support from the Minister today but as we develop these debates through future legislation we can revisit the issue and ensure the overall system gives as many guarantees and protections as possible for the father, the mother and, most important, the child."	spk_151

However, I accept there are resource implications. When one registers the birth of a child, the birth certificate is filled out. It is already the case that a copy of the record is maintained and held locally and State-wide. Having the parents' names on the birth certificate does not guarantee guardianship, but a record is kept of the birth certificate, which is very important documentation for many reasons as one moves on in life. We cannot stand over the fact that the statutory declaration which gives one guardianship is not maintained centrally. While I accept that the amendment and the proposition from Treoir has resource implications, it is necessary. One cannot have a situation where there are serious implications if somebody loses a document. I accept it is unlikely that someone would lose a statutory declaration, but documents do get lost and sometimes there can be mischief involved. In the event of such happening, a person would not have a backup. It is necessary to have a centrally held backup of proof of evidence that one has made a statutory declaration. If both parents register their names on the birth certificate, based on the Minister’s amendment, they are notified that such registration does not guarantee them automatic guardianship and they are given an information leaflet. They could be advised they have 14 days in which to apply for guardianship. If at that stage the couple is happy and they come back and fill out the declaration but the relationship later breaks down the mother of the child would automatically have guardianship but the father would be in a difficult position because there is no central register with evidence of the statutory declaration, which is more important for the child in terms of parentage and guardianship than the birth certificate. It is not enough to introduce a pilot scheme. A central register must be set up. Given that my party will resubmit the amendment in the Seanad in two weeks’ time, if the Minister cannot accept the amendment now, I urge her to think about the resource implications in the intervening period. Such a measure must be introduced as part of the legislation.	spk_429

If a central register were introduced, it would be necessary to invite people to register declarations retrospectively. This would facilitate people who have made a declaration prior to the establishment of the register. I am sure a solution can be found. As Deputies will agree, the statutory declaration, which is signed with the consent of the mother and constitutes the mechanism by which guardianship is granted to the father, is a precious document. Surely, therefore, a central or back-up system should be in place to record the making of all such declarations. While I appreciate this presents a conundrum and the introduction of a register would have resource and logistical implications for the Minister, I will press the amendment because a major element is missing from the legislation.

It has been a long road and it is much overdue, but it is great to finally have it here before us. The starting point for Sinn Féin on all issues of human and civil rights and equality is the Proclamation of 1916. It may be almost 100 years old but it is the mission statement for every generation of Irish citizens. As an Irish republican party, equality is at the core of all that Sinn Féin represents. All citizens must enjoy full equality of rights and opportunities under law, regardless of their background, including sexual orientation or gender. Nothing less can be tolerated in a modern, progressive and inclusive society. Sinn Féin recognises that societal attitudes, the ban on the donation of blood, gender recognition, adoption, transphobic and homophobic bullying, the reporting of domestic and sexual violence, as well as marriage and employment equality, are a few of the areas of life where LGBT people suffer inequality and isolation. LGBT people suffer higher rates of depression, self-harm and suicide, directly attributable to social conditioning, the stigma and isolation of the historical and, unfortunately, State-led criminalisation, discrimination and harassment. Of course, that is not unique to Ireland and has, sadly, been the history of states throughout the world. I hope that, some day, Ireland will stand as a beacon of LGBT equality and that we will cherish, protect and celebrate the diversity of all of our citizens. The Bill before us today takes us a step closer to that vision. I am heartened to see Ireland edge closer to ensuring all of its citizens are equal. In 2015, it is simply unacceptable that the law does not treat each person equally. However, I am hopeful that we are on our way there. As a proud republican, I strive for equality every day.Republicanism is not unique to Sinn Féin. It exists across our people and in every political party. We believe in a real republic where all citizens are equal, regardless of the colour of their skin, religious belief, sexual orientation, where they live and what they do. To only offer same-sex couples civil partnership is to only offer them a second-class right. This is absolutely and entirely unacceptable in Ireland in 2015.  The time has come for full marriage equality for all. Put very simply, this is a human rights and equality issue. Loving, committed relationships between two consenting adults should be treated equally, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. All couples, same-sex or otherwise, should be allowed to share the same responsibilities, obligations and respect that marriage provides. This should be enshrined in the Constitution. Same-sex couples and their children are families just like any other, but these families currently do not have the same legal rights and protection that are available to other families in the State. This is wrong. We now have the chance to ensure that same-sex couples are no longer treated as second class citizens in our State. It is an exciting opportunity for us to have a chance to change all of this. What better way to celebrate 1916 than by enshrining rights of equality within the Constitution, which is our primary law and the people's law? Approaching the centenary of the 1916 Rising, Sinn Féin aims not only to commemorate the revolution but to achieve one of its most noble aspirations, that of cherishing all the children of the nation equally. We are serious about this. Sinn Féin has always campaigned on issues that can bring about positive change for all the people living on this island, and for that precise reason we will be actively campaigning for a ""Yes"" vote in the upcoming referendum. This May the Irish people have an exciting opportunity to say that we value all of our relationships equally. My party is proud to support this referendum and we ask the Irish people to vote ""Yes"" to civil marriage equality. A ""Yes"" vote would send a powerful message to couples who have waited their entire lives to legally mark their love for one another. We also need to make it clear to all young people who are having difficulty coming to terms with their sexuality and struggling to deal with it that we support them and that their choices are as legitimate as the ones that every single person around them, straight or gay, is making. This referendum was called for by the citizens at a Constitutional Convention. This is the people's referendum. Civil marriage equality is about protecting our families, neighbours and friends. It is about two people making a commitment to share in the ups and the downs of life. Lesbian and gay people are not alone in their demand for full equality of rights and opportunities, regardless of sexual orientation, gender, ethnicity or background. My party wants everyone on this island to have the same opportunity no matter who we are, what we look like, where we are from or whom we love.  On 22 May we, the Irish people, should take pride in entering the ballot box to extend equality to our neighbours, friends, colleagues or family members. Irish people are being given a chance to create an Ireland where our citizens are valued equally. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for first-time voters and the established electorate to end the discrimination that many lesbian and gay people living in Ireland continue to experience. Marriage is important to Irish society. It is a secure foundation for committed and loving couples. Everyone should be free to marry on those terms. A ""Yes"" in this referendum is a yes to lesbian and gay people being full participants in Irish society and fully equal in the eyes of their fellow citizens."	spk_399
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-02-24	dail	31	Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015: Second Stage	dbsect_29	"I am very happy to see the much anticipated and long-awaited Children and Family Relationships Bill reach the floor of the House today. I am only sorry it has taken so long to get here. As we all know, this Bill is the biggest change to family law in the State's history, finally taking account of the diversity of modern Irish families, and this can only be celebrated. The reality of an Irish family in 2015 is very different to what we traditionally viewed as a family, and it is time that we overhauled our family law to reflect this. Children should never be punished because of the circumstances of their birth or the marital status of their parents. Unfortunately, until the publication of this Bill, they have been. All children deserve to be fully valued and to have equal rights. Sinn Féin will be supporting this Bill and we commend the Minister on getting it here today. We will have some amendments on Committee Stage that we hope will strengthen what we see as some of the weaker areas of the Bill. From the outset, I challenge the attempts by some to label this Bill as the ""gay adoption Bill"". This is a mischievous disservice to what is a pretty comprehensive overhaul of family law. Single persons who are gay or lesbian have been able to adopt children for many years now, and the Children and Family Relationship Bill just ensures that in the case of same-sex relationships, both parents of the child have guardianship rights and that the child has the same rights as any other. The failure to recognise the diversity of family life in Ireland has had a serious impact on the lives of children. In the Ireland of 2015, children are being increasingly cared for by unmarried parents, step-parents, civil partners and others acting  I am pleased to see that the Bill recognises the reality of diverse family types and forms in this State today. The impact that this will then have on the lives of thousands of children and their families is incredibly positive. With this Bill, we need to ensure that a child's right to family life is protected. Bunreacht Na hÉireann places a great importance on the family, defining it in Article 41 as ""the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society"". However, the Courts have interpreted the ""constitutional family"" as only referring to marital families. Irish law currently does not provide anywhere near adequate legal structures for protecting the right to family life for the significant number of children in non-marital families. This is simply not acceptable and it is not fair. Where is the equality in that? We are thankful that this Bill will mean that children living in non-marital and non-traditional families will be in a position to enjoy a legal relationship with the person who provides them with day-to-day parental care, whoever that may be. We are also pleased to see contained within the Bill a comprehensive definition of the ""best interests"" principle in line with Article 3 of the United Nations Charter on the Rights of the Child. This is most welcome in terms of providing guidance for the Judiciary, and it promotes consistency in application. We are also welcoming of the fact that the Bill will ensure that a child's voice is heard and considered when important or life-changing decisions are made with regard to guardianship, custody and access. Section 32 of Part V of the Bill empowers the court to appoint an expert to ascertain the child's views in proceedings on guardianship, custody and access where the child is not able to express his or her views directly. We believe in the importance of the participation of children in judicial decision-making and are very much in favour of the appointment of an expert to ensure this. We are disappointed that a number of issues do not feature in the Bill. Sinn Féin would like to see the establishment of a central register for statutory declarations for joint guardianship to provide protection for the statutory declaration documents which grant guardianship rights to unmarried fathers in respect of their children. We also would support the establishment of a comprehensive court welfare service to support the roll-out of this legislation. This service would provide an appropriate mechanism to carry out assessments of the child's welfare and best interests and ascertain his or her views while also carrying out family risk assessments. It would also ensure, where appropriate, that supports and services would be available to the child and family, such as mediation services and child contact centres. I have already expressed concern about some aspects of the Bill, and I would like to raise these again today. I have a worry regarding the cohabitation section, whereby a father living with the child's mother for 12 consecutive months, including at least three months with the mother and the child following the child's birth, will automatically become a guardian. As the Minister knows, in some cases this is simply not possible.Sometimes mothers are still living with their parents, and it is not always appropriate or indeed possible for the father to live there also. This is often the case with teenage or unplanned pregnancies. It does not always mean that the father is shirking his responsibilities or not stepping up to the plate; the circumstances are just not in his favour. What about all the fathers who are working away from home, perhaps abroad, and who must do so simply to be in a financial position to support the child? There is nothing substantial in the Bill for unmarried fathers aside from cohabiting for the requisite amount of time. Everybody else will continue to be obliged to resort to the courts if the mother does not agree to sign a statutory declaration for joint guardianship witnessed by a peace commissioner or a commissioner for oaths. I have read a number of articles on this in recent days, and there was an excellent article by the columnist Colette Browne in the  Sadly, there are men who do not step up to the plate. Of course, they will not seek a declaration of parenthood and guardianship, and hopefully they will be pursued for maintenance to meet their responsibilities. However, if a father steps up to the plate from the start, he is entitled to equality of parenthood from the start. If it transpires that he is not meeting his responsibilities - for example, if there is domestic abuse or he is not a fit father - that would matter. I firmly believe that the father and the mother should be given equal status in law as parents and equal guardianship from the beginning, and I will table amendments to achieve that. What is provided for in the Bill in terms of conditionality is not equality of parenthood. Perhaps the Minister would take the time to read the article I mentioned, although she might have already done so. It is a very good contribution to the debate and I hope she will consider it. In line with other jurisdictions such as Northern Ireland, Britain, many European countries and Australia, unmarried fathers should have automatic rights to their children when registering the birth. I will certainly seek to strengthen this area of the legislation. There are questions about how the new laws will work in practice. Will the courts be sufficiently equipped and supported to hear very complex family law cases? How will low-income families who do not qualify for legal aid be able to use the courts? I have some concerns about how aspects of the Bill can be implemented given the serious resource restrictions that exist, the lack of consistency and specialist knowledge that can characterise some family law proceedings and the requirement to hear children's voices. I am generally concerned about the way family law is dealt with by the current court system, a system that is in serious need of overhaul. The days when children and parents are huddled into packed court waiting rooms along with other citizens who are there for civil cases must end. A dedicated and fully resourced family law court system, backed up by a comprehensive court welfare service, is required. Of course, the long-awaited publication of the Mediation Bill and its progression through these Houses would be of immense value to families enduring separation and divorce, and not just in terms of legal costs. The ability to resolve the issues in dispute in a non-adversarial environment rather than using the blunt instrument of an adversarial courtroom must be encouraged and facilitated more than is the case at present. While mediation is currently available, too few families are availing of this option. The two persons separating should be required to attend an information session on the mediation process before their case can be accepted by a registrar or heard by a court. I also have concerns about the public's perceptions of rights in this area. In the experience of my office, many parents mistakenly believe that having a father's name on a birth certificate gives him guardianship rights. This misinformation has major adverse consequences for children. Will the Minister consider rolling out a public information programme about guardianship? This is an area where there appears to be widespread confusion among many of our citizens. There is regularly communication with our office from people, particularly fathers, who are unsure as to what rights they have or where they should go to find information. I appeal to the Minister to allocate resources to ensure that more people are made aware of the rights they have in terms of guardianship, particularly as family life in Ireland is so different from how it once was. We must make this information as accessible and widely available as possible. Information should be provided to all unmarried fathers mandatorily at the time of birth registration. If this included the legal position of unmarried fathers and the lack of rights for non-cohabiting unmarried fathers, it would remove much of the confusion. I commend the Minister and all those who worked with her on this Bill. These proposals, if enacted, will improve the lives of many people and, most importantly, the lives of many children. The Children and Family Relationships Bill is long overdue, but it will move us closer than ever towards protecting all children in Irish society as they should be protected. It is imperative that we get this legislation right. I and my party are happy to work with the Minister to ensure this. There are too many vulnerable children and families depending on this legislation to get it wrong."	spk_321

However, when Bob Olson and his colleagues from the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, as part of their substantial report on the crime investigation carried out over three years, they spoke about the inadequacies of PULSE. They said that ideally they would like to see the replacement of PULSE, which, obviously, is a view that would be supported. We want to see the IT systems of An Garda Síochána being improved as we move forward. That would fit with an upgrade of how it did its business in crime investigation. The difficulty is that the Minister has not made any provision for this in the Estimates which we discussed yesterday.It could be quite some time before that system is replaced.  While I take on board the Minister's comment that GSOC states it now has access based on protocols, there is concern. It goes back to the debate last night. The ombudsman in the North of Ireland signs the Official Secrets Act in respect of security issues, has the same powers as the police force, is regarded as the same and has the same access as the police. I would like GSOC to have real teeth, the same powers, the same obligations and sign the same statutory declarations as An Garda Síochána. This amounts to full access all the way for it. The best way to do this would be to enshrine it in legislation, rather than providing for it in protocols. Protocols mean An Garda Síochána is still in control, even though there are agreements and understandings in place. If it was enshrined in legislation that GSOC and An Garda Síochána were on a level playing pitch, with the same powers and responsibilities to the State, it would be better for everyone.	spk_279

I was chairing the public oversight committee when the Garda Ombudsman Commissioners came before us to speak to their seven- or eight-page summary of the report into the Kieran Boylan affair. I appreciate that protocols are in place and that levels of co-operation have improved, but what they revealed then was disturbing. Also disturbing was their decision to publish a seven- or eight-page summary of their findings in the media. They appeared on RTE's ""Prime Time"" and they appeared before our committee. According to whatever understandings were in place at that time, documents were to be given within 30 days. That was the understanding. In one case, after over four years, one document was never given to them. I believe that senior members of An Garda Síochána stymied their investigation. I know it went to the DPP and that there were no charges, but no member of the public can look at the evidence. The allegations could not have been more serious to the effect that somebody who was charged with possession of €1.3 million worth of drugs and was visiting grief and misery on communities in this State had charges dropped. It was alleged that he was an informer on behalf of some within An Garda Síochána and was being handled off the books, and that other people were being set up. Some of the senior gardaí who were blocking that information and documentation being given to GSOC were under scrutiny. That was an example of why the requirement to hand over documentation within 30 days must be on a legislative, statutory footing, rather than some friendly protocol or something that was agreed. I am aware that much has changed and I welcome many of the reforms that are on the way, and that more power is given to the independent policing authority here. My fear is that the system, even though it uses nice language, always tries to resist real change, real accountability and real equality in relationships. I would like to have one Garda Ombudsman, but we need a situation where the three Garda Ombudsman Commissioners are absolutely equal in the eyes of the law with the Garda Commissioner and are given the same powers and ability to hold the Garda to account. The Kieran Boylan affair was scandalous. Saying it was scandalous does not even do justice to the appalling lack of co-operation and procrastination, stalling and blockage by senior members of An Garda Síochána into a matter the Garda Ombudsman Commissioners themselves felt they needed to investigate.These actions held back justice. While I accept that protocols have been introduced in the meantime, we need more than protocols. We must send a clear message in legislation that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Commissioner have equal status and must have the powers needed to do their jobs. I hope the Minister, having declined to accept previous amendments, will accept this amendment and the timeframe of 30 days. Anyone following this debate, particularly those who have reflected on the Kieran Boylan affair, will agree that we need something more than protocols and language such as the phrase ""as soon as is practicable"". A clearly defined deadline is required and there must be serious repercussions when it is not met."	spk_322

Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality travelled to the North of Ireland and to Scotland to review their policing board models, Ombudsman models and criminal justice inspectorate models as part of our work leading to recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality.

We should think about the rationale the Minister of State has just provided. There are ombudsmen in different sectors. Ms Emily O'Reilly was very successful as Ombudsman and is now the European Ombudsman, based on the success of that model and her strong performance in the role. It was also a tribute to the Irish people and the success of our Ombudsman model and how well that worked. The Minister of State made a point about what happens at weekends. There are senior staff who can deal with these matters, but in general the buck needs to stop with one Ombudsman. Let us consider other sectors. We have the Financial Services Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, and an Coimisinéir Teanga. It is one person every time and the buck stops with that person. I have not heard any argument justifying the need for three people to make a decision that should be made essentially by one person. The model internationally with police ombudsmen, sectoral ombudsmen or public service ombudsmen is for one person with senior advisers making the call. The chairman of GSOC has recently resigned to take up a new position in Britain in order to be closer to his family and so on, and good luck to him. That vacancy gives us an opportunity to address the difficulties with the current structure. I feel very strongly on this. The Government has not offered any justification for this not happening.	spk_259

The episode demonstrated the need for clarity that, in order to be effective, the Garda Ombudsman needs full authority to fully investigate every member of the Garda Síochána, up to and including the Garda Commissioner.

Perception alone creates a problem in this context. The point we want to get to is having as many complaints as possible investigated by independent people with the requisite skills. We are willing to work with the Minister on the wording of this amendment if there is a problem with it."	spk_280

Of course, the Garda Inspectorate is not relevant to this debate. I will not be pressing the amendments because they are not worded properly. However, the objective of the amendments is to ensure that the issues Deputy Wallace and Deputy Daly have outlined do not continue. People are having to wait crazy periods for an outcome. A large percentage of cases are being referred back to An Garda Síochána or are being dealt with by gardaí seconded to GSOC. We need to get to a stage where only minor matters can be addressed within the office, for example, a case in which a garda did not get back to a person or some other minor complaints that could be dealt with easily. This was the view of the justice committee. However, anything of substance should not be investigated by a serving, seconded or former member of An Garda Síochána. There must be complete independence. There should be a pool of independent investigators or options available. Clearly GSOC has not developed this enough because we can see backlogs in cases, even those which should be straightforward. Some are taking far too long. What is the outcome? Public confidence in GSOC simply does not exist. If a constituent comes to any Member, he or she would advise that constituent of the option to make a complaint to GSOC. However, the perception is there is no point because either it would be investigated by the garda involved or it would take too long. Unfortunately, that has become the reality. That is why this Bill is so important. We need a fresh start. We need to demonstrate to the public that the commission has teeth and resources, that it can get things done sharply and that it is genuinely independent in its role. I am not going to press the amendments because they are not worded properly or as they should have been. However, I call on the Minister to take on board the intention of the amendments and to work with us. I figure we will have to come back again sometime soon to put in place another Garda Síochána (amendment) Bill and to arrange for further powers to be given to the Garda ombudsman. There will be several votes in the House tonight if we cannot get agreement. This is part of an ongoing discussion with the Minister. She may not agree with us tonight but I hope that over time and as we prove that things are not working properly we can revisit them. I will not press it but I call on the Minister to take on board and listen clearly to my intention. Then perhaps we could address it through further amendments. If this does not happen tonight or tomorrow then perhaps it will happen in the near future.	spk_285

It is important because there will be grey areas. There will be matters of importance where the Garda Síochána may believe on security grounds that something should not be submitted, information should not be given or an investigation should not take place, but when the situation is examined, that is not the case. It is important that it is not just the Minister who makes that call. I like to think she would welcome that responsibility being taken off her. This goes back to the point Deputy Wallace made earlier, which I totally agree with, namely, that one of the big problems we had in recent times was that the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, had a sort of umbilical relationship with a former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, which was very unhealthy and led to a lack of independence from the Minister and a lack of due diligence around the issues that were coming to him one by one. That kind of relationship must end. If we allow a situation where these security matters are deliberated only by the Minister, we go back to that type of scenario. If there is an independent adjudicator who has a role designated by the State - I am suggesting here that this would be a member of the Judiciary, a High Court or Supreme Court judge, whatever the Government would deem appropriate - that body decides what is sensitive for security reasons and cannot be given, and what is not. That is the purpose of these amendments. It is vital. I was trying to figure this out myself, but when Conor Brady said it - obviously he is a respected person, a former Garda Ombudsman Commissioner - I took it down and thought it was a solution to the conundrum we may have.	spk_297
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-02-04	dail	31	Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014: Report Stage	dbsect_32	Whenever we met the ombudsman in the North as part of the Oireachtas justice committee's preparation for putting recommendations and proposals to the Minister, one of the things that became apparent is that the ombudsman in the North has the same powers as the police in terms of the Official Secrets Act and so on. In other words, it has unrestricted access. It smacks as being very arrogant that the only people who can protect the security of State are the Government of the day or the senior members of An Garda Síochána. Where we want to get to is to give the oversight body the capacity to do its job, unless there is some sensitive issue involved. My concern is that not too many people in Ireland had confidence in the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, in terms of his independence, when he left office. They saw that he was joined at the hip to the Garda. He has been found again and again, be it by the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Garda Inspectorate, not to have been on top of his job in terms of looking at failings within the Garda. Indeed, the review by the independent panel of the Department of Justice and Equality also found that the Department was failing in its responsibility to hold the Garda to account. The problem historically, be it with the Minister or the Department of Justice and Equality, is that they have been too close to An Garda Síochána and their independence in these matters - the Minister talked earlier about perception - is perceived as not being too strong. I am sure there are examples in other jurisdictions. I cannot see the difficulty in allowing a very senior judge, perhaps up to Supreme Court level - an esteemed person, learned in the law - to adjudicate on these matters. This would assure the public that they have looked at the matter and they believe An Garda Síochána is entitled to withhold on security grounds. This would also serve to define clearly what are security grounds. We need to be clear what is national security because it could be an extremely loose term or be understood very loosely. I believe the Minister is giving herself far too much power, with all due respect, considering the track record of what came before her and the history of the Department in recent times. She should not take my word for it, given the range of independent analysis. I believe it is a foolish decision. If the Minister persists in not accepting the amendment, I will call a vote.	spk_301

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-02-03	dail	31	Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill 2014: Second Stage	dbsect_28	"It is good the debate on the Personal Insolvency Act has been reopened. In 2012 when this legislation was first debated, mistakes were made by an arrogant Government which decided it was better off trusting the banks rather than listening to those who work at the coalface with people in debt. We cannot let another opportunity slip past us. This time the Government must listen to those in debt and those who work with them. On the face of it, the Government is simply tidying up a range of issues that require clarity. We will listen closely to the Minister and examine in detail these proposals to ensure they do the job as intended. There is a much wider issue at play and the cat is now out of the bag. The comments from the Taoiseach and senior Ministers last week that the system was not working showed what this Bill should really be about. It should be about correcting mistakes made, the same mistakes about which the Opposition parties warned the Government.In 2012, we were promised a review of this legislation. Where is that review now? Can we just skip to the part where we do what should have been done in the first place? The reality of debt is with us as much as ever. The reality of debt for many is that it is the last thing on their minds before they sleep - if they can sleep - and the first thing on their minds when they wake up. It has led to suicide and addiction. That is why we have to get this right. The economic realities of debt are stark too. Thousands of households see every cent soaked up by interest and repayments. Paying a mortgage has meant not spending a cent in the real economy above and beyond the bare essentials. Like our national debt, personal debt is a huge burden preventing economic growth. My party is prepared once again to engage constructively to tidy up the Government's mess and build a personal insolvency service that actually works for people and families who are over-indebted. When this Bill was first proposed by the then Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, he told my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, that he expected 15,000 people to avail of the various new arrangements in the first year of the service. Less than 10% of that number have actually availed of it. As a systemic solution to personal debt, it has failed. The reason it has failed is that the game was rigged from the beginning. The banks had a veto and they have used it. What the experts who work with people in debt said would happen has happened. The Act has not delivered. The proof lies in the numbers who still choose bankruptcy. Years later to hear the Taoiseach and Tánaiste suddenly realise there is a problem just shows once again how out of touch they are. While we will examine the Bill in detail on Committee Stage I am stating clearly here that my party's primary objective is to remove the veto. If the penny has finally dropped on the Government side then we will work with it to achieve that goal. It is apt that we are discussing this Bill in the same week as my party and the Technical Group have tabled a motion in Private Members' motion calling for an EU-wide debt conference. We must never forget that the personal debt crisis in this State did not come out of the blue. While some people clearly made poor decisions, most were simply hit by a tide beyond their control. The Banking Inquiry has begun to look at the ties between politics, property and finance in the State, which lie behind much of the crash. For my party, this debate is not about forgiveness or doing people favours, it is about repairing society after it was attacked. Personal debt, like business debt and our sovereign debt, must be made affordable and sustainable. This Government saying no to a debt conference is like a highly-indebted family refusing to meet with an insolvency practitioner out of pride. It makes no sense and can only hurt the country. From 2011 it was the mantra of this Government when asked about the mortgage arrears crisis that the Personal Insolvency Act was on the way and thousands of struggling homeowners would be liberated from unsustainable debt and would be free to remain in their homes. That was bluster and deceit which has now been exposed. What the Government actually did for struggling homeowners was remove the legal protection given by the Dunne judgement. When Sinn Féin proposed a Bill replacing Dunne with a more sustainable model, Labour and Fine Gael marched the troops in to vote it down. Anybody looking at that debate would have found no coherent reason for voting it down other than that the Troika told them to do it. In connivance with the Central Bank, they then allowed the banks to meet their targets for mortgage arrangements through legal actions. The Government sat back and let the banks off the leash. Now that fruit is ripening as we see hundreds of repossession cases taking place across the State. Labour and Fine Gael might be happy to consider repossessing a family home as a ""sustainable solution"" but Sinn Féin is not. The number in long-term arrears is continuing to rise over three years after this Government came to power. The personal debt crisis is still with us and nothing substantial has been done to tackle it. The mortgage to rent scheme, for example, has failed utterly. My party has consistently called for an independent resolution system to be put in place to force banks into arrangements where the family home is concerned. The core issue remains that we have a Government that trusts the banks and supports the banks over the people, a Government that owns two-and-a-bit banks but will not use that leverage to benefit the people in whose name they own those banks. We have seen this time and again. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan paid top dollar to Mercer to publish a report on bankers' pay but then let the banks ignore it, force the cuts on the lower paid workers or just get rid of those workers altogether while protecting the bankers at the top. The Government owns 99% of AIB but will not lift a finger as it outsources its core staff. Banks were hiking up interest rates on variable mortgages at a time when the ECB was lending to them at record lows without a peep from the Government who owned those banks. There is a pattern of capitulation to the banks time after time. It is that fear of the banks that means the Personal Insolvency Act has failed in its intended aim. It is not the fault of the insolvency service staff who are doing the best they can. People in debt are not going to play a game they know is rigged to their disadvantage. We have before us an opportunity not just to tidy up but properly to sort out once and for all a functioning insolvency system which will make a difference. I will be tabling amendments to remove the veto and to empower people in debt to break free and start rebuilding their lives without the bank having to agree. I am calling on all sides to bang our heads together and to work together to rectify the mistakes made in 2012 and to put in place an avenue of hope for the tens of thousands of struggling households worried about losing their homes, and for all others burdened everyday by fears of debt taking over completely."	spk_286

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	42	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2015-01-21	dail	31	Junior Cycle Reform: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_34	We have been waiting on this debate for years and, therefore, I am delighted the motion is before the House. Everyone recognises the need for reform of the junior cycle. Everyone, including Members on the Opposition benches and members of the teacher unions, has bought into the idea of reform and agrees that reform is good. We welcome aspects of what is proposed by the Department but there are others about which we have concerns. It is unfortunate, however, that we are considering reform of the junior certificate examination against a backdrop of continuing cuts in education. Teachers are being asked to implement a reform which the Minister believes will deliver improved educational outcomes against the background of diminishing resources and an increasing student population. She must listen to the teacher unions' professional opinion that the proposal to allow teachers to have the final say on their students' progression is not the best way to teach. Tomorrow thousands of teachers will take to the picket line. This has been building for some time. The teachers have tried to avoid this but they feel they have no option but to strike again and we extend our solidarity to them. Sinn Féin calls on the Minister to postpone the implementation of the proposed reform until all outstanding issues have been resolved. We do so because parents and students place great faith in their teachers and entrust their children to them every day. We value teachers for delivering education to our children and recognise that they are highly professional and have the best interests of our children at heart. When teachers argue that this proposal is not in the interests of our children's education, we must listen to them. While the other issues raised in the talks between teaching unions and departmental officials can be resolved, something needs to give in the stalemate on continuous assessment. We cannot continue with the implementation of junior cycle reform against a backdrop of one-day stoppages by teachers and a refusal by the Department to move further. Few doubt that reform of the junior cycle is needed so that students at second level receive the best education possible. However, the changes that have been proposed by the Government have been met with dismay by the teachers in delivering that education. They are the experts. We cannot forget this and we must listen to them. Their concerns are not driven by self-centred interest but by virtue that they want their pupils to receive the best education. It can hardly be fair on students or teachers that assessment at junior cycle level is made by the teachers themselves. Surely this will lead to discrepancies in the education system, with results and standards varying from school to school and from teacher to teacher, and it will lead to allegations of favouritism and discrimination. This is not a fair system. There is also the question of whether schools are adequately resourced to deal with a change of this magnitude to the junior cycle examination system. They are at breaking point and teachers are overstretched and beyond their full capacity. Austerity has meant that many schools have been pushed past the brink and some are unable to cope with the system that is in place, never mind the pressures a new system would likely heap on them. Our party calls on the Minister to revisit the proposed system and to put on hold the introduction of the new system until she has talked to teachers and parents groups and allayed their fears. We in Sinn Féin are not against change. We believe change is needed and we want what is best for students. I am struck by the dilemma this issue raises. I heard one teacher on radio discuss how he and his colleagues could be accused of favouritism, particularly in rural areas. For example, a teacher may golf with a student's father. People socialise together and share the same community together. Most people can relate to the teacher unions' suggestion regarding independent mediation and assessment. The practical difficulties teachers face in implementing continuous assessment need to be revisited.I hope the issue can be resolved because it is in nobody's interest to have teachers out on strike.	spk_362

Also, currently the panel is looking through the documentary evidence provided to it. Some families have the capacity to explain the case in great detail, but others may not have that capacity.

The first gathering of the Dáil took place on 21 January 1919, just around the corner from here in the Mansion House, and the Teachta Dála who gathered there declared to the world the freedom of the Irish people and put their programme for Government to the Irish people and to the world. They asked for recognition of our State. Tragically, recognition was hard to find and we were bound into a war over the next number of years and the tragic consequences of all of that. We in Ireland are aware of the importance of recognition by other countries of one's right to statehood and to freedom and dignity. I am delighted that this motion will be passed, it appears, unanimously, here tonight in this House. I recently had the chance to visit the Occupied Territories and Palestine. I was in Ramallah and I travelled from there, through the infamous Kalandia checkpoint, through what is called the Devil's Elbow - that long winding road that Palestinians must take to journey to Hebron, Bethlehem and other locations. Rather than the direct route, the Palestinians must take this long circuitous route. Along the way, I saw at first hand both Israel's wall of division - its Apartheid wall built around Jerusalem - and the settlements. On the journey that day, I passed through areas A, B, and C. I visited Hebron and I saw how the Al-Ibrahimi mosque, the scene of the Hebron massacre 20 years ago, is now annexed for the use of Jewish worshippers in a section of it. I saw how their sacred mosque, the fourth most sacred place for those of the Muslim faith in the world, is surrounded by military installations. I saw at first hand the occupation of that city to protect just 400 Israeli settlers, and, of course, the settlers who are all around the city. I saw the infrastructure that Israel has constructed - the settler-only roads where, as we speak, they are destroying the two-state solution. Those roads that connect the settlements illegally under international law to the city of Jerusalem are settler-only roads - it is Apartheid. I travelled on to Bethlehem, a city with considerable potential in terms of tourism and wealth creation for the Palestinians who live there. The Israelis advise tourists not to stay there stating they will bus tourists in to visit the Church of the Nativity where Christ was born and will bus them out again. The Palestinians who live there do not enjoy the benefits of the place where Christ was born for their community, and they want to. They embrace and celebrate it, but they are not able to enjoy the benefits. Then I spent a full day in Jerusalem. I was horrified at what I saw at first hand. There is a situation where the Israelis have annexed east Jerusalem for a long number years. During that period they have built illegal settlements throughout the city and as one drives past those settlements, everything is spick and span. There is a tram connecting these illegal settlements to the rest of Jerusalem and Apartheid is again in place because one sees, on going into the Palestinian communities within Jerusalem, that those communities are not maintained. One can see litter. One can see the roads are not maintained. Even traffic lights do not work. That is the Israeli policy and practice because we, in the international community, have sat on our hands and expected the Oslo Accord to be implemented on its own. In Jerusalem, I met Palestinian families who are being evicted from their homes and whose homes are to be demolished. In one case, I met a 96 year old woman who had just been beaten by settlers. Within that city, settlers terrorise the Palestinians, who are driven to despair. I then met a family where a lad was 14 or 15 years old. He had been arrested 16 times. He was nine years old when he was first arrested by Israeli forces. They are trying to drive the Palestinians within this area out of their homes. It is very difficult for a Palestinian to build a home in Jerusalem today. All around me, be it in Ramallah, throughout the West Bank and even when we visited Jerusalem that day, at a whim the Israelis closed down the Kalandia checkpoint which meant that a Palestinian could not gain entry into Jerusalem. Merely for some derisory security reason on that given day, they closed down the whole place. We were fortunate because we held foreign passports. We could go a circuitous route and come into Jerusalem another way with our foreign passports, but it was not for the Palestinian people to go to and enjoy their city.Palestinians in east Jerusalem are not even citizens; they are residents. They are given residency by the Israelis who are occupying east Jerusalem in defiance of international law. It is shocking to see it at first hand. I was profoundly saddened on my way home. The two-state solution is dying as we speak. The Palestinian people no longer control 22% of historic Palestine, which they were so generously willing to accept; they control approximately 5%. If one takes the areas that are described as A, B and C and take away the Jordan Valley and east Jerusalem, all that is left is 5%, which does not amount to a state. The international community has allowed that to happen. I have not even mentioned Gaza, which has again been destroyed by an onslaught. The Israelis have blockaded Gaza. There is no airport in the state of Palestine. One cannot fly there. That is why it is so vital that more and more countries across the world take the initiative, take an independent stance and, accordingly, recognise the state of Palestine. I listened to the Government’s argument. The motion commends the Government on some of the initiatives it has taken. I appreciate that it is important to build international alliances and to work in partnership to resolve issues, but the fact is that the international community has absolutely failed the Palestinian people. I cannot describe the level of despair I witnessed. I was in the West Bank. I did not get into Gaza. I did not see where the real and utter devastation is evident. I refer to the looks on the faces of people in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and everywhere else that we met them. Those beautiful people with their beautiful culture and sheer potential to build a nation and take their place among the nations of the Earth have been so failed by the international community. We have worked to reach consensus with other European states but there is no consensus. Even when a report condemned the illegal settlements in the West Bank the trade partnerships still continued and we still purchase goods from the illegal settlements. We still give them the green light and allow the Israelis to have nuclear weapons and to deny that they have them. We still allow them not to sign up to the non-proliferation treaty yet we demand from Iran the highest possible standards where they might even be able to use nuclear energy for their own economy. At the same time Israel has all the weapons that we never demand to see or on which we expect accountability. I passionately believe that the best interests of the Israeli people, who have a right to security, their own state and to peace, is in a two-state solution. If the Israelis give the Palestinian people their dignity and negotiate a proper state, not 5% but the 22% the Palestinian people are willing to accept, that is the surest way to achieve peace. I will be at the front line tabling motions in the House to defend the Israeli people if they come under attack having done the right thing. The purpose of the motion is to say that we as a sovereign, independent State wish to take our own position on the matter. We have the opportunity to do that tonight. I cannot describe how happy I am that we will do it, but the next step is for the Government to recognise the Palestinian state. I hope to see that happen soon.	spk_554
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-12-04	dail	31	Water Services Bill 2014: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_25	The Government has come under extensive public pressure on water charges. It has been forced to introduce the proposed lower rates. This was not something it wanted to do; it was something in which the Government had no choice. Next Wednesday, the Government will be faced with even larger protests. Today, however, it could take the opportunity to do the right thing and scrap water charges here and now and I call on the Government to do so. Sinn Féin will be opposing the Bill. As it stands, the only acceptable solution is to abolish water charges and dismantle Irish Water. Water is a right for all our citizens. The charges being implemented by the Government are unnecessary, unjust and will cause major hardship for families and communities that have already been devastated by the Government's relentless pursuit of the austerity agenda. Sinn Féin has consistently opposed water charges north and south of the Border. We are committed to reversing water charges in government and we have said as much clearly on the record. Sinn Féin is committed to campaigning to defeat water charges and we are standing shoulder to shoulder with families, communities and campaign groups that are opposed to water charges. Simply put, these families can take no more. The Government is pushing people over the edge. This Government is in crisis and has lost its mandate. Ministers are now so unpopular that they face mass protests at many of the events they attend. An Garda Síochána has had to reassess security arrangements for Ministers. Surely these people have lost their mandate. Throughout this year those in government have limped from one crisis to another, but all of their own making. We have a crisis in our health system and our education system and within our policing service. The Government is fighting a war on all fronts. It has made choices which have failed to ease the burden and give low and middle-income families a break. We have heard so much talk about democratic revolution but there is no democratic revolution in the Dáil. The democratic revolution is on the streets and at the ballot box, undertaken by ordinary people who have decided that enough is enough. The continuing trends in the polls show this much. The water fiasco is the last straw. That is the phrase that we hear from ordinary people in middle Ireland who have never protested in their lives. They say this is the straw that has broken the camel's back. It is a question of the accumulation of all the cutbacks in public services and increases in taxes. There comes a point where the people take power into their own hands and that is what has happened. Instead of listening to citizens the Government offered crumbs from the table. The revised plan does little to give relief to citizens who cannot afford to pay. It shows the Government is refusing to listen and it shows how far removed it is from public opinion. Government Members foolishly hope the smaller bills that people will face in 2015 will encourage more to co-operate with a metering programme and, most important, to pay their bills when they start to arrive in letterboxes next April. This shows the increasing desperation and blind panic of the Government. It will probably have to face the electorate sooner than it had planned. Irish Water and the water charges are hanging around its neck. That is not how I would like to approach the electorate if I were in government. We have seen the peaceful protests work, including at the ballot box, in particular with the by-elections and local and European elections earlier this year. Sinn Féin's alternative is to abolish Irish Water as it stands because the public and Deputies on this side of the House have lost confidence in it as it has stumbled from one crisis to another. We would create a new public body with a much greater input from democratically elected local authorities and the input of those with long years of experience dealing with issues and problems related to the provision of water. Most important, the body would be accountable to the Minister and the Oireachtas, with the Comptroller and Auditor General having an important role in auditing and overseeing accounts. It would be under the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman. I call on the Minister of State to note in particular that when our water services were delivered by local authorities, citizens could take any complaints they had to the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman had jurisdiction over water services because they were part of local authorities. Now, the option for independent oversight has been lost. The Government may say the regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation, now fulfils that role, but it is not under the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman either. I call on the Government to ensure that our water services are returned to the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, as in the case of the freedom of information issue which arose earlier this year. The Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions has Ombudsman personnel before it as witnesses regularly. When the Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, was before the committee, we had a discussion about concerns he had, shared by other ombudsman personnel throughout Europe, to the effect that even when public services go into semi-state or private hands, it is still a question of public services being delivered. Ombudsman personnel throughout Europe argue that such services are public services no matter who is delivering them and, therefore, they should be under the remit of an ombudsman. The idea is that a citizen should have the right to make a complaint if his experience of public services is not up to standard. As the Minister of State is aware, there have been overwhelming numbers of complaints about Irish Water since it came into being. This is a major issue and I call on the Government to consider it. The Government has addressed the freedom of information problem that arose earlier in the year and I call on it to consider this problem in the same light. It is vital to remind the Government that the charges being introduced are the same for millionaires as for those on the lowest incomes. This is a regressive tax. Some people are genuinely finding it difficult to make ends meet and will welcome any amendment to water charges. Our party is committed to reversing the charges if it is in government and if they have not already been reversed at that point. It is a red line issue for us. However, the people cannot wait for the next election and need to have these charges scrapped. I predict a huge gathering next Wednesday. Every Deputy has heard about this from their constituencies. It will be a moment of truth for the Government. Is the Government capable of seeing that at times it must roll back from a position it has taken? The changes announced on 19 November were a desperate attempt to stave off massive and growing popular opposition, to allow the Government to serve the remainder of its time and to avoid humiliation in the next general election, whenever it may be. I urge as many people as possible to turn out for the peaceful protest planned in Dublin for 10 December. I look forward to standing in solidarity with the citizens of the State next Wednesday. The Government should own up, admit it is wrong and abolish Irish Water and water charges immediately. The Government had an opportunity to listen, take a step back and abolish water charges and Irish Water but did not take it. The Government cannot govern against the will of the people. The Government has lost the mandate of citizens and if it continues on this path I predict that the days of the Members on the other side of the House in government are numbered. If the Taoiseach genuinely cared about the citizens of the State he would call a general election and go to the people. We have asked him to do this in a motion that we have tabled for debate next week. The Government parties went to the people with a message that if they voted for the Labour Party they would be saved from the Fine Gael Party's water charges, while Fine Gael stated that if people voted for it, the party would not introduce a charge unless meters were installed.The Government has failed the people. The promises are broken. I consider the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, to be a sincere and thoughtful person who has a great deal to contribute to Irish politics, but this time everyone in government must go back to the drawing board, get rid of the charges, scrap Irish Water and then re-engage with Irish people. The people have lost confidence, not just in the Government but in the political process. In fairness to them, they have taken control of that by going out on the streets. The Minister of State knows the profile of the people who have been protesting. In my home county and on the television, I have seen that they are people who have not protested before. They are mothers with their families pushing prams. They are people who have endured all of this hoping that at some point there would be light at the end of the tunnel. This issue has become the one on which they have chosen to resist. The last election was not just an issue for Fianna Fáil but for every party, including my own. If one makes promises and commitments and then goes into government and breaks them, one will find there is no such thing as a safe seat. There is no such thing as a party that has a right to be in government. The country has changed forever. One can see it, and it is an issue for everybody. I call on the Government to reflect on that.	spk_319

She is Minister for Justice and Equality. In the neighbouring jurisdiction an investigation was carried out by the PSNI and, unfortunately, the case did not go to court. It is under independent review regarding the DPP’s role in it. As the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland is investigating the matters involved, there is an independent review mechanism, yet the Minister could not get in quickly enough to make a public statement where there was a political opportunity to cast a slur against my party. I will not read the requests from the many families who allege their loved ones, in the State for which the Minister is responsible, were murdered and that there were cover-ups in their cases and who want to meet the Minister but cannot do so. Where is the consistency in how the Minister makes decisions on families? How can she so clearly make a statement on one case in the North of Ireland but engage in no commentary on cases in the State for which she is responsible? The accusations levelled against her by the families and many others were of blatant political opportunism and inconsistency in her approach to victims alleging the commission of the most heinous crime of murder in the State.	spk_12

Broadly, they welcome it. They have made the interesting observation that there was nothing in it that they could not have told us about resources. I am referring specifically to the issue of rosters. There has been significant criticism of the rostering system, the matter of Garda vehicles and the fact that many trained gardaí are tied down in doing administrative work.

One of the most annoying things for me and, more importantly, front-line members of An Garda Síochána was the terminology used of smart policing and modernisation that we kept getting from the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, and the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter. It was nonsense. The bottom line was that they were dressing up the cutbacks and their impact as being something else. The report shows the urgent need for real modernisation and to deal with the impact of the cutbacks. There will be a challenge for the Government in deploying resources, although I recognise that the Minister went some of the way in the recent budget.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-11-18	dail	31	Motor Fuels Issues	dbsect_39	I have repeatedly raised this issue over recent months and I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise it today. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, will relay my concerns to his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton. The Lough Swilly bus company provided a service from Buncrana to Derry city, including all the stops along the way. The service was very important to the elderly and disabled people who use the route. Given that the Lough Swilly bus company has gone into receivership, a new company, McGonagle bus service of Buncrana, has taken over the route. Under the rules around the free travel scheme, however, it has not been able to avail of financial assistance that would enable it to provide a free bus service to the elderly and disabled. It is unfair. In recent days I have learned that Ms Marian Harkin, MEP, has pursued the issue at European level and the European Commission has ruled that the Government cannot do what it is doing.If the Minister of State has not received a response from his departmental officials, I ask him to have the matter checked out. My understanding is that the European Commission has ruled against Ireland, saying that it cannot deny entry to the scheme. That would include McGonagle's bus services, so hopefully that will resolve the issue.  I am disappointed, however, because elderly and disabled people along the route have been put to considerable economic hardship by having to pay for a service that is free for every other elderly or disabled person across this State. It is not a case of freezing a service, because the Minister of State has taken the service away without reinstating it. If the service was frozen, he would have ensured that the new company, which is on exactly the same route that was always historically provided, would be provided with the financial assistance to cater for elderly and disabled passengers. I and other public representatives have repeatedly raised this matter. The Minister of State may say that a review is under way and that we must await the outcome of that review before allowing new participants onto the scheme. In this case, however, a service has been withdrawn from that community rather than being frozen. Citizens who should have a right to a free bus service in order to interact socially with family and friends - something that every other senior citizen across the State has - are being denied their rights. Disabled people, as well as families with relatives in respite care, and those with loved ones studying in Derry or availing of services in other locations along the route are being denied that right. That is how serious this matter is. It is not a frivolous or trivial matter. I am interested in this confirmation from Marian Harkin, MEP, who raised the issue concerning a company in County Cavan called Leydon's Coaches. She challenged the issue under EU competition law and apparently the European Commission has overturned it. I appreciate that the Minister of State may not have had a briefing on that, as he had no advance warning. Nonetheless, will he please look into the issue and ensure it is resolved? Even if that information about the European Commission's ruling is not 100% accurate - and I am relying on Marian Harkin's guidance in this - the issue has to be resolved. I therefore ask the Minister of State to reinstate the service.	spk_326

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-11-18	dail	31	Free Travel Scheme Eligibility	dbsect_41	I have repeatedly raised this issue over recent months and I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise it today. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, will relay my concerns to his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton. The Lough Swilly bus company provided a service from Buncrana to Derry city, including all the stops along the way. The service was very important to the elderly and disabled people who use the route. Given that the Lough Swilly bus company has gone into receivership, a new company, McGonagle bus service of Buncrana, has taken over the route. Under the rules around the free travel scheme, however, it has not been able to avail of financial assistance that would enable it to provide a free bus service to the elderly and disabled. It is unfair. In recent days I have learned that Ms Marian Harkin, MEP, has pursued the issue at European level and the European Commission has ruled that the Government cannot do what it is doing.If the Minister of State has not received a response from his departmental officials, I ask him to have the matter checked out. My understanding is that the European Commission has ruled against Ireland, saying that it cannot deny entry to the scheme. That would include McGonagle's bus services, so hopefully that will resolve the issue.  I am disappointed, however, because elderly and disabled people along the route have been put to considerable economic hardship by having to pay for a service that is free for every other elderly or disabled person across this State. It is not a case of freezing a service, because the Minister of State has taken the service away without reinstating it. If the service was frozen, he would have ensured that the new company, which is on exactly the same route that was always historically provided, would be provided with the financial assistance to cater for elderly and disabled passengers. I and other public representatives have repeatedly raised this matter. The Minister of State may say that a review is under way and that we must await the outcome of that review before allowing new participants onto the scheme. In this case, however, a service has been withdrawn from that community rather than being frozen. Citizens who should have a right to a free bus service in order to interact socially with family and friends - something that every other senior citizen across the State has - are being denied their rights.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-11-18	dail	31	Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 3) Bill 2014: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_45	One of the remarkable outcomes of the economic crisis which was inflicted on the Irish people, as well as on the people of several countries in Europe, has been that those who caused the crisis by adhering to the bible of deregulation, privatisation and liberalisation, and who followed the diatribes of Reagan and Thatcher, won even though they failed our people because their huge gambles in Las Vegas banks were paid back by citizens across Europe. Assets which belonged to the people of Europe were privatised or made ripe for privatisation. That is the environment in which the Irish people are expected to trust Fine Gael, which shares the world view of political parties that have implemented these right-wing policies and associates with these parties within the European People's Party. We are expected to accept Fine Gael's assurances that it will be grand because it is in the legislation. The reason people seek to enshrine matters of immense importance in the Constitution is because only the people can undo such provisions. The best way to reassure the Irish people that there is no plan to privatise their water is to agree to a referendum on this amendment. I have no doubt it would be overwhelmingly passed and public ownership of water would thereby be protected. Given that the Government is in such a crisis, I do not understand why it is not availing of the opportunity provided by this Bill to reassure people. This leads me to have doubts about the Government's intention. In its approach to Europe wide policies, Fine Gael is closely aligned in ideology, word and deed to its colleagues across the EU. There has been resistance across the world to the privatisation of water, most heroically in Bolivia, where it was literally a matter of life and death. The attempt to privatise water led to a popular uprising. Uprisings are taking place across the countries in Europe that have been betrayed by their own political leaders and the right-wing ideology of greed and inequality. In Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland there is a noticeable swing to genuine parties of the left which believe in equality. These parties have shown solidarity internationally. Sinn Féin is proud to work in partnership with political parties, particularly in Spain and Greece, which share a common platform and to present to people in Ireland and, because we have a bigger picture view, in Europe and across the world, the fight back and popular resistance against that which has failed them. How can this famous 1% have so much control over our lives? Why do we fear to ask the very wealthy - I am not speaking about the middle classes or the upper middle classes - to pay their fair share? We do not begrudge them the big house, the big car or the big lifestyle. All we ask is that they pay their fair share, that they do not have tax avoidance schemes, travel to exotic places or move their companies here, there and all around. Whenever Sinn Féin proposes commonsense economic policies which ask the very wealthy to pay their fair share to take the pressure off the squeezed middle and the vulnerable, we hear the bleeding hearts defending them.It is for these reasons that people do not trust the Government when its members tell them not to worry, this is all covered in the legislation and everything will be grand. Legislation can be changed overnight, but the Constitution cannot be changed unless the people sign off on that change by way of a referendum. If the Minister of State and his Fine Gael Party colleagues are sincere in their assurance that privatisation of water supply is not their plan - albeit it is the shared objective of their right-wing colleagues in Europe - then they should back this Bill and thereby answer the people's demand for a referendum on the matter.	spk_358

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-11-12	dail	31	Allegations Regarding Sexual Abuse by Members of the Provisional Republican Movement: Statements	dbsect_30	There was a profound policing vacuum in the North for many decades. This was not created by republicans. During the conflict, large sections of the community in the North did not access or trust the criminal justice system. In some cases, citizens were victims of state abuse or the police turned a blind eye to abuse. We cannot be selective in dealing with the failures to handle allegations of sexual abuse, and there is no hierarchy of victims. All should have been ensured the protection and support of the state in which they lived and this State.Women prisoners were subjected as a matter of policy to the sexual assault of strip searching. The women subjected to this abuse deserve access to justice and to hold to account those responsible, those who conducted the assaults and those who sanctioned the policy. Throughout the conflict in the North, the police and court service were subservient to the objective of combating republicanism. This cannot be discounted as republican propaganda. The state pursued as policy the primacy of gathering intelligence on republicans over that of tackling criminality. It has been the experience of many victims who went forward to the RUC that they were more interested in intelligence gathering than dealing with their complaints. We are also unaware of the number of abusers who were safeguarded from arrest or had charges dropped if they became an asset to the Special Branch or British Army intelligence. Indeed, victims, while they made complaints, were recruited and taken advantage of. This was the practice that was in place until the implementation of the Patten Commission. This was the force within a force that operated throughout the conflict. Successive Irish Governments were aware of this and that was why a new beginning to policing formed a key part of the Good Friday Agreement. We cannot be prescriptive or selective as to who is entitled to due process and support. To ignore that reality is to ignore the abuse that went unreported or investigated by the state with the potential that abusers were safeguarded from arrest. All victims of abuse at a time of conflict deserve support and access to justice. This must include those who could not access the supports of the state, those whose allegations were failed by the RUC, and those who were let down or who were failed by the actions of republicans. Indeed, many living in the North of Ireland who endured all those years watch with great interest when Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil politicians have an interest from time to time in the affairs there, usually when there is some political advantage to be obtained. Any proposals to support and provide justice for abuse victims must address the legacy of state forces or be seen not to be selective and party-politically motivated. I understand that there are approximately 300 serious cases on the desks of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality. Most, if not all, of these cases have been referred to the independent panel of counsel for their review and recommendations. Some of these cases are of persons or families alleging the cover-up of murder and a profound failure of the criminal justice system in this State. Despite requests from some of these families for meetings with the Taoiseach, no meetings have been facilitated. The Taoiseach has not commented on their cases. The Taoiseach has not labelled the accused as guilty without due process. The Taoiseach has not set aside any time in this Chamber for statements on these matters. I refer to 300 cases involving some of the most serious allegations one could imagine and there are no demands for debates from around the Chamber from those who have taken advantage of this today. The Taoiseach protests that he cannot comment on those cases as an independent review process is under way. Many of these families have contacted me and many others in recent weeks with the observation that the Taoiseach and others in government left aside all of this previous practice to avail of the opportunity to score political points. They are hurt and outraged about this. The Taoiseach and his Government colleagues stands accused of cynicism and political opportunism. I believe them to be guilty on both charges. I wish to outline a few of these cases. The late Mr. Shane Tuohey was from Tullamore, County Offaly. He was 23 years old. On 2 February 2002, Shane attended a night club. He would never return home. His body was taken from the River Brosna in Clara on 9 February by his brother, Edwin, after a week long search. Shane's family believes that their son was the victim of a brutal assault that night that led to his death and that his body was subsequently dumped into the river. They have attained the services of two forensic pathologists based in the United States, both of whom put Shane's brain injury down to head trauma. One of the forensic pathologists, Dr. Kim Collins, states that in his opinion the manner of death of Mr. Tuohey is homicide, yet a Garda source was quoted after Shane's body was recovered as stating that foul play was not suspected. Worse still, a member of An Garda Síochána went on the local airwaves to state that the late Mr. Tuohey had gone missing on a number of previous occasions. His family have rejected this statement as entirely untrue. The Tuohey family believe that their son and brother was murdered and that some members of An Garda Síochána were involved in a cover-up. They are devastated by their experience and they have a harrowing story to tell. Mr. Jim Goonan was found dead in his home in Birr, County Offaly, in March 2002. Jim's brother, Cyril, believes that he was murdered despite the advice given by An Garda Síochána to the DPP that his death was not suspicious. Cyril and his family have a serious story to tell. On 2 August 2011, Mr. Shane O' Farrell, who was 23 year old, was killed by a hit-and-run driver at Carrickmacross, County Monaghan. A law graduate, Shane had handed in his dissertation for his master's degree at Trinity College earlier that day. Like the late Mr. Tuohey, he had a full life ahead of him. Words cannot describe the devastation Shane's death has caused to his parents and siblings. His mother told me when I met her that their family are destroyed. The driver of the car that killed Shane was a drug addict with 40 previous convictions and was at large because of two suspended sentences imposed on both sides of the Border. Shane's family believe that their son and brother was killed by this State because of the incredible litany of failings in the criminal justice system that culminated in his killing. Theirs is also a harrowing story. Tomorrow, a delegation of families seeking justice for their deceased relatives will visit Stormont Castle to meet senior politicians from each of the political parties in the North, including the DUP, Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP and the Alliance Party. The families, who live in this State, including some of the families I have just discussed, have lost loved ones in violent circumstances - in two cases, their own children. They have also been unable to get a meeting with the Taoiseach. There is no comment from the Taoiseach or senior Government colleagues because an independent process is under way - that is their defence. There is five hours of debate here today with some statements read into the record even though there is an independent process under way in the North, and I wonder why. The families will also be accompanied at the meeting tomorrow by the Garda whistleblower, Mr. John Wilson, and the journalist, Ms Gemma O'Doherty. This is the first phase in a new international awareness-raising campaign about cases of alleged Garda wrongdoing which will be taken to, among other institutions, the European Parliament and the United Nations next year. Will the Taoiseach finally meet these campaigners and these families, or is there not political opportunity in this for him? As Sinn Féin spokesperson on justice and equality, on many occasions I have raised issues having met families from this side of the floor and, repeatedly, I have been met with obfuscation, denial, resistance and refusal to engage with those families. I gave some examples today. I could have read so many more but I do not have the time. In recent weeks those families were outside the Dáil protesting, looking for a hearing from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality and looking for their families' experiences of the profound failure of the criminal justice system in this State to be discussed, and they cannot be heard. People are not fooled by this debate today. Out there they know that what happened today was a cynical episode of political opportunism and point-scoring, mostly by those who could not give two damns about the people of the Six Counties and who spent their entire political careers denying the rights of people in the North, turning their back on them and kicking down anybody who would defend their rights. Nobody is fooled by this episode today. Shame on the Government which will not meet the 300 families in this State but did what it did today. Nobody is fooled. They should enjoy their journey.	spk_393
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-11-07	dail	31	Report of Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions: Motion	dbsect_3	I thank the Minister of State for his comments and look forward to working with him and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly on implementing as many of the recommendations as possible. As I noted in the foreword to this report the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, following the Seanad referendum expressed concern about voter confusion with the Seanad ballot paper. The matter of 14,355 people spoiling their votes in a referendum to abolish the Seanad should cause great concern. However, we need to recall that there were on that day two referendums, on whether to abolish Seanad Éireann and whether to establish a Court of Appeal and make other changes to the courts system. Was there confusion because we had multi-referendums on the same day? The joint committee considered Deputy Charles Flanagan’s concerns and agreed that apart from the issue of multi-referendums on the same day two other issues could also have had an impact: first, the design, text and language of the ballot paper; and second, the question, was to all intents and purposes, a double negative. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is responsible for the various legislative codes dealing with the conduct of elections and referendums. So in advance of meeting the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the joint committee wrote asking him to address the problems in the design, text and language of the ballot papers. The then Minister, now Commissioner Hogan, replied and included a report prepared by the franchise section at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the questions raised. The joint committee considered that report which crystallised the issues in four main themes, as follows: that the format of the ballot paper has remained largely unchanged since 1963; the acceptance of the need for research and the type of comparisons used in that research; holding multi-referendums on the same day; the proofing of the wording in advance of its being put on a ballot paper; and whether the question always be put in the positive when the intention is to secure a negative. I have a knowledge of parliamentary procedure and practice and Dáil Standing Orders. If we as parliamentarians err, we can always rely on the helpful guidance of the Ceann Comhairle. I am sure, however, that Members have experienced confusion in voting when the decision required is in the negative but the question is always put in the positive. I still have not figured out how to vote during Committee and Report Stages of a Bill. It is an archaic legalistic system. Maybe it is necessary here, and we can get assistance but it can be very confusing. If this causes confusion to politicians who vote on an almost daily basis it is easy to understand how in the Seanad referendum many of the public were confused. The joint committee was advised that the format of the ballot paper has remained largely unchanged since 1963, the same year that RTE television went on air. If the same pace of change applied to RTE as has applied to the format of ballot papers, the public would still be looking at a test card hoping that in the future, or in the new measurement of time when Irish Water is sorted, there would be a one-channel national television service broadcasting for four to five hours per day in black and white and colour TV would be for the next millennium. Today we are a far cry from 1963: we have the Internet, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and smartphones that can have apps by the million yet the auld ballot paper stays the same. Are we trying to pretend that the ballot paper is some new media form of Oscar Wilde’s picture of Dorian Gray?  In this report a number of recommendations are made and there are two key recommendations: first, the members have agreed to revisit this report within the next six to 12 months to invigilate and examine the progress made in the implementation of the recommendations, and second, the joint committee recommends a permanent electoral commission be established with a mandate to conduct research, which is vital. This report refers to 14,355 people spoiling their votes in a referendum to abolish the Seanad. However, in the May 2014 European elections there were 17,258 spoiled votes in the Midlands-North-West constituency; 6,368 spoiled votes in the Dublin constituency; and 21,798 spoiled votes in the South constituency. This is a total of 45,424 spoiled votes in an election for the European Parliament. In the local elections held on the same day there were over 19,400 spoiled votes. There should be concern at such a level of spoiled votes. Research is necessary and must be undertaken within a permanent electoral commission established with a mandate to conduct research and it must be reported on to Dáil Éireann. As practising, professional politicians we should always be pushing for change. There should always be examination, but one cannot and should not make policy decisions without information, which we get from research. I thank the Minister of State for his response on behalf of the Government and look forward to developing this. When we finally get people to the voting booths, they are confused. The wider issue of voter turnout needs to be examined. That is another day's debate.	spk_15

We have been waiting a long time for these extra powers to be given to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. It is has been a very disturbing period in terms of the whole area of the administration and application of justice in this State. Public confidence has been fundamentally undermined by the incompetence, and sometimes arrogance, that this Government has shown in overseeing all the episodes that have emerged in the recent months and, indeed, years. In the months the Minister has held her current office, I acknowledge that she has sought to move in a very different direction from that taken by her predecessor, Deputy Shatter. However, I noted, with interest, her comments reported in today's Irish Independent. She has a large number of dossiers from families all over Ireland seeking justice. Some of those cases are of the most serious and profound level, including murder and accusations of cover up of murder. They are very serious. I note she has not commented on those. A number of the families - quite distressed families - who have written to her today have contacted me to say and note that they have not been offered a meeting by the Minister or by the Taoiseach. The Minister has not agreed or offered to meet them. These are cases where they are alleging that their loved ones were murdered and there was a cover-up of the murders. The Minister has refused to comment on these very serious cases, even though they are on her desk and she has seen the full extent of the allegations. She has refused to comment on them because she said a review is under way. I point out to her that the allegations to which she has referred in today's Irish Independent have been referred by the person making the allegations, Maíria Cahill to the police ombudsman in the North and today there is an independent review of the role of Director of Public Prosecutions in all of that, and that is right and proper. There is a process under way, yet the Minister chose to comment on those matters, which is entirely inappropriate as the Minister for Justice and Equality, as she must know. Let me be clear, this is the precedent that she has now established. I will be expecting her to openly comment on any cases I bring to her attention as we move forward. She need not use the excuse of a review or a panel or anything like that. I want her to look at the facts that will be presented to her and give a comment in the public domain because if she does not, she will be seen to be inconsistent and politically opportunistic. I look forward to her responses to these various cases I will bring to her attention in the time ahead. The Taoiseach spoke today about referring these allegations to the justice committee. He said he would speak to the Chairman of that committee, Deputy Stanton, who is present. Let us be very clear that again this is a very interesting precedent because the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, as a matter of policy, has not been dealing with individual justice cases because the process has not been completed. That has been our approach and I think it is a fair one. However, if the Taoiseach refers this matter to the committee and we deal with it, I want to be clear in pointing out that I will be insisting on all of these families who have made allegations to also come before that committee. In every single case where a family has alleged that there has been a cover-up of murder by An Garda Síochána, I will be insisting that those families also come before our committee. I will be insisting on that in the interests of fairness because the families have contacted me today. The Minister has no idea of the outrage she the Taoiseach has caused these families. They have said that they cannot get a meeting with the Minister, they cannot get her to comment on the cases of their loved ones and now she has taken immediate action in this area. They are very clear as to the reasons for that. Let me be clear, the precedent the Minister set in this case will be the measure of every other case I bring to her attention in the time ahead.	spk_362
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-10-21	dail	31	Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014: Second Stage	dbsect_27	"Our party has repeatedly called for an independent policing authority. As recently as February this year, I asked the former Minister for Justice and Equality about establishing it and he robustly rejected the notion. An independent policing authority was not included in the programme for Government because it was not considered important enough. Unfortunately it has not been included here either, however, I am assured that it will be established in other new legislation in the coming weeks. I, and my party, will be continuing to push for this as we believe that it is integral to the reform of policing in this State. For example, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, did not have the ability to oversee the Garda Commissioner. I am happy that this Bill will rectify that in section 7. For the first time the Garda Commissioner will be brought within the scope of GSOC investigations. This is a great improvement. In recent times, we witnessed the limitations of the powers of GSOC when it could not access the PULSE system directly. Unfortunately, it appears that this too is not addressed in the legislation. The inclusion of this was one of the recommendations of the Oireachtas in its submission to the Department on the reform of policing. Our committee called for the statutory provision of GSOC access to the PULSE system to better equip GSOC staff in their investigations. In May 2013 a GSOC report to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence clearly stated that there were issues regarding its ability to exercise its oversight function due to a lack of independent access to Garda computerised systems, such as PULSE. The adherence to agreed protocols between the gardaí and GSOC should be made compulsory in legislation. We should legislate to grant direct access to PULSE for GSOC. I will seek to submit amendments on this as I believe it is crucial to the work of GSOC. Another concern I have with the Bill, which I would like to raise at this Stage, concerns section 9. I note with interest the language used here. It states that the Garda Commissioner is to provide necessary information for investigations by the Ombudsman Commission ""as soon as practicable"". There is vagueness to this language that worries me. A former GSOC commissioner, Conor Brady, is on the record as stating that an obstacle to GSOC's work when he was a member was how Garda management had an ability to slow things down. The Minister will recall the report from GSOC about the length of time it took to deal with the Kieran Boylan affair - a special investigation took four years to deal with very serious matters. We do not want to see this continuing. I ask the Minister for reassurance that this will not happen. I am also considering an amendment to strengthen the language here. I also want to make reference to further comments made by Conor Brady more recently at an event both the Minister and I attended with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Law Society. He spoke about how often GSOC would be stopped in its tracks with an investigation by being told certain information was not available to it or would be very delayed on the basis that it was a national security issue.We need to ensure this is supervised to ensure it is not used as a mechanism to hamper GSOC investigations. I may seek to amend the legislation to reflect this, perhaps with the introduction of an independent adjudicator, as suggested by Mr. Brady, or perhaps a judge, who could decide whether such information should be given out on these grounds. That is important and I believe the Minister and I are in agreement on it. Independent oversight is necessary here. Consider the issue of accountability concerning questions. It has been brought to my attention by journalist Gemma O’Doherty in recent days that she has reported that former Garda Commissioner Mr. Martin Callinan had penalty points for speeding terminated. He confirmed this in an article in the  While some of the recent submissions to the Oireachtas committee recommended the abolition of the inspectorate and the effective merging of its role and that of GSOC, Sinn Féin believes a different approach would be more effective. We advocate the broadening of the role of the inspectorate to that of a criminal justice inspectorate. In a similar fashion to the way in which the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, conducts inspections of various institutions within the health sector, we believe the criminal justice inspectorate should have a similar role within the justice sector. It would be primarily responsible for the effectiveness and efficiency of the workings of organisations within the criminal justice sector. That would include both inspection and reporting of its examination of policies, operational practices and procedures across the sectoral organisations specified in any new legislation and work to ensure public confidence is maintained. It should also have responsibility for laying its reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The bodies we want to see under the remit of the proposed criminal justice inspectorate include An Garda Síochána, GSOC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Probation Service, the Courts Service and the Irish Youth Justice Service. The Oireachtas justice committee made the same call. The model in the North is working very well and I am sure the Minister can establish that with her ministerial colleague, Mr. David Ford, MLA. I want to move on to the membership of the commission. Section 13 sets out that ""'member of the Ombudsman Commission' means a member of the Ombudsman Commission appointed under section 65 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005"". This legislation sets out that the commission is to consist of three members. I do not agree with this. I firmly believe there should be only one ombudsman. Again, the Oireachtas justice committee recommended changing the structure of GSOC so as to have one ombudsman rather than three commissioners, stating a single ombudsman would ensure greater accountability and no possibility of dissenting opinions or divergence in the ombudsman's findings. Consequent to the committee’s initiative, we went to the North and Scotland to look at the models there. We were impressed with the approach in those jurisdictions. I will seek to submit an amendment regarding section 65(1) of the 2005 Act to change the structure of the commission so that, instead of having three commissioners, there will be a single Garda ombudsman. Earlier this year, my party launched its contribution based on its experiences of all the submissions made in this State and the experiences of our team who negotiated the changes to policing in the North. We do not have all the wisdom and I do not contend the former RUC is in any way comparable to An Garda Síochána but there are lessons in the North to be learnt in the context of the new beginning there, the policing board, the police ombudsman and the criminal justice inspectorate that could comprise a useful contribution to reforms in this State. Our document was circulated to all Oireachtas Members, and I invite those who have not had an opportunity to take a look through it. It is our considered contribution but it is not definitive. We in Sinn Féin believe in a new beginning to policing similar to what happened in the Six Counties. The Morris tribunal happened owing to the failure and abuse of the power of some police officers in my county at the time in question. That was to be the new beginning. We had the Garda Síochána Act and GSOC was established, in addition to the Garda Inspectorate, etc. These matters are in evolution. We now have an opportunity to consider best practice internationally and ensure we really give the ombudsman the teeth and powers it requires. One of the big criticisms of the ombudsman is the demoralising length of time it takes to deal with a complaint. While the Minister has allocated some additional resources, she will probably need to allocate more in terms of the new powers and responsibilities it will have, and of course the existing investigations with which the office is already being asked to deal. I feel very strongly about and ask the Minister to consider seriously the formation of a criminal justice inspectorate that would examine the overall picture within the justice system. There is the recommendation from the Oireachtas justice committee and a model in the North. While I commend Mr. Bob Olson, Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate, and his predecessors, I believe they need more teeth. We need bigger-picture analysis and to consider the full picture of what is happening in the justice system. The Minister has received the submission on that. We want to see a new dispensation in order to achieve more strengthened and sustainable reform that can deliver a modern 21st-century policing service now and in the future. We need to see freedom from partisan political control or influence, operational independence and policing with the community to develop maximum confidence in the policing service and maximise co-operation between citizens and An Garda Síochána. As I said at the outset, I welcome this Bill and am happy with the majority of its content. However, as I have outlined, there are a number of ways in which it can be strengthened, and I will seek to do this on Committee Stage. I look forward to working with the Minister in this regard. The Minister should not underestimate the anger of some of the families who contacted me today and whom I am sure have been in contact with the Minister also. They have made profound allegations, substantiated by considerable documentation, and submitted them to the Minister’s office. They have been referred to the independent panel of senior counsel and may end up being subject to independent inquiries. The families believe the Minister has not commented on their cases. She has made no comment whatsoever. She has not agreed to meet the families, nor has the Taoiseach. The Minister should be very clear that the precedent she has set today is the one that will have to be honoured in terms of consistency. She will be held to account on her approach to all cases because the one she referred to today is subject to considerable review by the ombudsman and to an independent review of the DPP. There is a very clear process under way, as the Minister knows. She has chosen to comment on it, as is her absolute right, but I will hold her to account to ensure consistency. If the Minister decides to refer this matter to the Oireachtas justice committee, I will ensure all the families who are waiting to be heard get the same treatment."	spk_364

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-10-16	dail	31	Seanad Reform: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_21	It is almost 12 months since the citizens of this State voted to retain the Seanad. Many of them wanted the Upper House to be retained but not in its current form. Instead, they wanted it to be reformed. The Government promised to initiate reforms but, as we all know, this did not happen. The McNulty affair has further eroded confidence among members of the public that any reform has taken place. This is another jobs-for-the-boys affair of the type they have become so used to over the years. Last year the Taoiseach gave a commitment to the effect that he would reform both the Seanad and the political system. That commitment has not been honoured; that commitment was broken. As this Parliament's second House, the Seanad should have the power to hold the Government to account. Unfortunately, the Seanad as it stands is undemocratic, unrepresentative and unproductive. It is simply not fit for purpose. One of the main reforms relating to this newly reformed Seanad - so-called - is that the Adjournment debate will be replaced by a commencement debate to be held before the Order of Business each day. This will allow Senators to raise questions with the relevant Ministers earlier in the day. Effectively, changing the time at which particular debates are held is one of the main suggested reforms. This is not exactly earth-shattering stuff, is it? Real reform would involve introducing a universal franchise and giving votes to emigrants. The motion before the House outlines how the Seanad can be reformed in order to ensure that it becomes more inclusive of society, representing all the people of Ireland and not just a privileged minority. We are calling on the Government to immediately engage with all parties and groups within the Oireachtas, but also with broader civic society, to consider how best to reform the Upper House in order to ensure it becomes a fully inclusive, representative and accountable institution. We are asking the Government to introduce direct election by way of a universal franchise of all Irish citizens. We want to ensure that our citizens in the North and members of the diaspora across the globe will be represented in the Seanad and will have a voice in the home country to which they have given so much. Indeed, there are those among the diaspora who may well still be financially contributing to this State - as has been the case through the generations - and they may make a contribution in the future when, hopefully, many of them will return. Many of our citizens, particularly the young, have been forced out of their country but they desperately want to return at some stage. Why should they not be represented in these Houses? Their voices need to be heard. The current inequality of citizenship, which punishes Irish people who live outside the State, must be ended. We strongly advocate that 50% of those elected to the Seanad in the future should be women. Women constitute the largest group of individuals who were excluded from the benefits of the Celtic tiger economy. Households headed by lone parents and older women remain at high risk of poverty. Structural inequalities continue to trap many women in low-paid part-time employment. Sinn Féin is committed to building a more equal Ireland and women's voices are essential to that. The rightful position of women in Irish society is for them to be equals in every way and they should be represented on an equal basis here. If we cannot achieve equal representation in the Dáil following the next general election, at which new gender quotas will apply, then we must ensure that the Seanad will provide, in a balanced way, a real reflection of Irish society and the real experiences of Irish citizens and families throughout the State. We should also use the Seanad to ensure the representation of marginalised minority groups within Irish society. Creating the conditions for the establishment of an equal society means recognising that many diverse groups and sections within that society require enhanced protection by the State. We should use the Seanad to hear from the groups which represent these citizens. The Seanad is not working. It has not worked for some time. Sinn Féin has been advocating for root-and-branch reform of the Seanad for over a decade. As already stated, the Upper House is undemocratic and unrepresentative. A reformed Seanad could serve our democracy well and act as an important check-and-balance mechanism with regard to the Dáil, which is dominated by the political parties. The people decided this; that was their real intent in retaining the Seanad. They did not vote to keep it as it is; they opted for real change. The people decided that there is a place for a democratic second Chamber in Irish politics, but they want to ensure that the representatives who serve in it will be elected by citizens, including those who live in the Six Counties and members of the diaspora. The Government is more than happy to use that diaspora for financial gain, investment, etc., but its members are not considered worthy of a vote. That is unacceptable. The Seanad should be an elected forum representative of the people and civic society, particularly those not adequately represented in the Dáil and the more marginalised sections of our community. I urge the Government to live up to its promises and reform the Seanad.	spk_368

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-10-08	dail	31	Workplace Relations Bill 2014: Second Stage	dbsect_18	I apologise on behalf of Deputy Peadar Tóibín who could not attend today as he has a funeral in his constituency. It is important to state from the outset that it is a shared objective of the Members of this House to reform the current industrial relations structures. From Sinn Féin's perspective, we have stated from the start of the Minister's consultations with stakeholders that we will support progressive proposals aimed at strengthening workers' rights, streamlining and simplifying employment rights bodies and procedures, ensuring satisfactory resolutions of workplace disputes and the robust and fair enforcement and compliance with employment rights legislation. As the Minister has acknowledged, promoting and supporting harmonious relationships in the workplace is an important element in achieving lasting economic growth and creating and sustaining jobs. It is our strong view that the best way to achieve this is through mutual recognition, respect and the creation of a level playing field. Aiming for lasting economic growth built on a foundation of sustainable jobs means the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues must confront issues such as trade union recognition, compliance with and enforcement of existing employment legislation, underemployment, excessively low pay and the myriad issues facing vulnerable workers such as informal insolvencies, blacklisting and the rogue actions of subcontractors who are forcing workers into registering as sole traders. Reforming employment rights structures is a good move but it will mean little at the end of the day if fundamental flaws in employment rights are not dealt with. On most of the issues mentioned the Minister's silence has been deafening. Some 129,700 workers in this State are underemployed and some 300,000 workers, or one in five, are earning less than the living wage of €11.45 an hour. To put this meagre salary into context, a worker on a living wage earns just 14% of the Minister's current salary. One in ten working families is in receipt of a family income supplement payment. Of course, low pay is not just the preserve of the private sector as nearly one in ten recipients of family income supplement payments are public servants. We should not forget that hundreds of JobBridge participants work in Government Departments each year never to be offered a full-time position, despite the critically important work that they do. Some 120,000 workers are living in poverty - those working in hospitality are most at risk and, not surprisingly, those working in the financial sector are least so.  Prior to the local and European elections we were promised a low pay commission but the necessary legislation remains languishing on the C list of the Government's legislative programme despite the fact the Government had the summer to draft what must be a straightforward piece of legislation. In addition to establishing the commission on a statutory basis and progressing the legislative process, the Minister said consideration is being given to establishing the commission on an interim administrative basis to carry out its functions as early as possible. When will we see progress on this and why is there a delay in publishing the draft heads of the bill? The challenges facing workers in a deeply competitive employment market mean we believe it is critical that, in enhancing workers' rights, the issues of trade union recognition and the right to collective bargaining be addressed. This is perhaps a debate for another day but underpinning all employment rights legislation must be a commitment by the Government that such rights will be defended and upheld. Sinn Féin's workers' rights spokesperson, Senator David Cullinane, raised a number of areas of concern in his submission on behalf of the party to the Government consultation process on the proposed changes to the industrial relations structures. We welcome the Minister's decision to constructively engage with our submission and in a number of instances he has heeded our concerns. We hope that on Committee Stage of the legislation amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies will be given the same consideration. The right to take a case, have it heard and adjudicated upon fairly by an independent third party and the right to an appeal must be the cornerstone of the broad area of employment rights. We welcome proposals to reform the structures of the employment rights bodies and the delivery of a more efficient, fair, simple and user-friendly system is also to be welcomed. It is also good that employees attending the various services of the WRC, be it the early resolution service, the mediation service or attending before the commission, will be entitled to trade union representation at all times. Concerns were raised by many trade unions and others in their submissions regarding the role of the registrar as set out by the Minister at the start of the process. In effect, he or she will act as a filtering mechanism deciding which cases should or should not proceed. We note that the Minister likened the role of the registrar to that of the legal advisor to the Equality Tribunal and we note too the case law the Minister quoted in responses to parliamentary questions. Of course, a small number of cases will fall before they begin for technical reasons but transparency regarding these decisions by the registrar will be critically important. An adjudicating officer may dismiss a complaint on the opinion that it is frivolous or vexatious and anxiety is always heightened when officialdom uses this language - too often we are not aware of how such charges are measured. We welcome the Minister's decision to provide for an appeals process to the Labour Court where an adjudicator dismisses a case in these circumstances. Again, in the Minister's initial proposals he indicated his intention to remove the right to an appeal - a measure we absolutely opposed in our submission. The right to an appeal must be an absolute entitlement, an integral part of due process, and we are not alone in this view. Concern was raised regarding the Minister's proposed introduction of fees for access to WRC services. He also sought a reduction in the time limit for making complaints - he wishes the limit to be six months. We recommended a time limit of years and the right to seek to extend the date where there is reasonable cause. While the legislation enables the Minister, through regulations, to levy fees and charges on users of the WRC and the Labour Court, it appears the Minister only intends to do so where a party fails, without good cause, to appear at the first instance hearing of the WRC and then wishes to appeal the decision to the Labour Court. When lodging the appeal the party will have to pay a fee of €300 which will be refunded if the Labour Court determines good cause.It would appear that while the Minister may not intend to introduce fees for accessing the Workplace Relations Commission at this time, the legislation enables him or a future Minister to do so at any time. It is worth noting that in their submissions to the Government’s workplace relations blueprint review, employer representative groups such as the American Chamber of Commerce and ISME sought the introduction of fees when making an initial complaint. The legislation imposes a time limit of six months within which to make a complaint, beginning on the date of the contravention to which the complaint relates, which is clearly not sufficient. Deputy Tóibín asked the Minister in a parliamentary question last month to set out the checks and balances that have been put in place to ensure equality rights will not be eroded as a result of the subsuming of the Equality Tribunal into the WRC. There are a number of concerns regarding the upholding of equality legislation within the legislation as it is presented. Equality officers in the Equality Tribunal will transfer to the Workplace Relations Commission to become part of a wider pool of adjudicators. It does not appear that specialist adjudicators trained in the complex area of equality law will be assigned to equality or equal status cases. It appears the legislation does not specifically outline how equal status cases will be dealt with. When complaints are lodged with the Equality Tribunal currently, its officers apply the legislation to the case to determine the issues and how the case should proceed. Concern has been raised that the commission's adjudication process may require complaints to lodge a more legally robust case in the first instance, and this enhanced requirement may act as a barrier to future cases. Enforcement and compliance remain two key areas of concerns pre and post the consultative process. We raised concerns in our submission regarding the proposed compliance notices, fixed charge notices and Labour Court orders to enforce compliance by employers to reduce the need to resort to prosecution. While employers who are generally compliant with employment rights law should not be unfairly punished for unintentional breaches, a balance must be struck where serious or consistent breaches occur. Deputy Tóibín asked the Minister last month what further action will be taken in the event an employer pays in full and in time a fixed payment notice but does not discharge in part or in full the outstanding award to a current or former employee to whom the notice relates. As is often the case, the Minister did not answer the question. We are no clearer as to what happens in such a circumstance. Almost all workers and employment rights bodies were unanimous in their opinion that a hefty fine and the imposition of a fixed charge notice should not rule out the possibility of prosecution. As the Minister noted, if the person on whom the notice is served pays the charge, the matter will not proceed to court. Arguably the monetary figure provided for in the legislation could result in an employer hedging his or her bets, coughing up the cash for a fixed payment notice, avoiding prosecution and having more money in his or her pocket where the notice amounts to less than the outstanding award. It does not appear the Minister has struck a balance in these provisions. It is important to state why enforcement is necessary in the first place; it is because employers regularly breach employment law. It is that simple. I hope the Minister will engage constructively with Opposition Deputies on Committee and Report Stages of the legislation and will consider amendments put forward.	spk_118
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-10-03	dail	31	Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill 2014: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_2	"I welcome Deputy Collins's Bill and its aim of making the Garda Commissioner responsible to the Garda Ombudsman Commission and to allow the Garda Ombudsman Commission to investigate complaints concerning any conduct of a member of the Garda Síochána made by another member of the force, among other proposals. Sinn Féin will support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage and we will seek to work with Deputy Collins to incorporate some of our proposals, which I will discuss later on. There is no doubt that we need drastic changes to our system of policing. The past number of months has seen public confidence in our policing and justice system further eroded after a string of scandals and debacles. A catalogue of recent controversies that have emerged through the courageous efforts of a number of whistleblowers relating to An Garda Síochána are both shocking and profound for the State, society and not least the gardaí themselves. The failure and inaction of our Taoiseach and this Government to respond properly to these matters as they emerged with the urgency required has been alarming and only served to further compound the crisis. We have deep-rooted and systemic deficiencies within senior levels of An Garda Síochána and other institutions of the State, including the Department of Justice and Equality. They failed to account for their actions, failed to discharge their functions and responsibilities in the public interest and failed to safeguard the integrity of these fundamental institutions of the State. There is widespread public support for rank and file gardaí - those on the front line. However, it has become increasingly clear that Garda senior management does not enjoy the same support of the public. The vast majority of gardaí are decent and patriotic servants of our people but they have been failed by their senior management and by successive Governments. For example, an independent policing authority was not included in the programme for Government because it was not considered important enough. As the various scandals emerged, something rotten in the culture among senior managers in the Garda Síochána and in the Department of Justice and Equality twined with the ineptitude and worse of the former Minister for Justice and Equality was revealed. With that, a glaring need for change became an unstoppable momentum.  I am glad that this Government has finally accepted the need to establish an independent Garda authority and increased powers for the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission after resisting them for so long. It should have happened a long time ago. A major step change is now required in order to restore public confidence and bring about the radical reform citizens expect and indeed deserve.  We in Sinn Féin believe in a new beginning to policing similar to what happened in the Six Counties. We want an open and transparent policing service - not a force but a service - representative of all residing in this State. We want to see a new dispensation in order to achieve more strengthened and sustainable reform which can deliver a modern 21st century policing service now and in the future. We need to see freedom from partisan political control or influence, operational independence and policing with the community to develop maximum confidence in the policing service and to maximise co-operation between citizens and An Garda Síochána. As most of us here today know there are five existing dimensions to policing delivery – An Garda Síochána and the Garda Reserve; the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission; the Garda Inspectorate; the professional standards unit and the joint policing committees across the State.What is clearly absent is an independent policing authority which would hold the Garda Commissioner to account and act as a non-partisan body, free from political control, since at this time the Commissioner is directly accountable to the Government through the Minister for Justice and Equality. Policing accountability should be premised on the law, the courts, the Constitution and the proposed charter of rights for the island of Ireland, as expressly acknowledged in the Good Friday Agreement. An Garda Síochána should be accountable not only to an independent policing board but also to the democratically elected Houses of the Oireachtas through scrutiny committees, as well as to local government and the communities it serves through joint policing committees. We also propose that the crime and security branch of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces Directorate of Intelligence come within the scrutiny of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, with the necessary safeguards in place based on international best standards.  An Garda Síochána must be accountable through a professional code of practice established by the Minister for Justice and Equality, applied by An Garda Síochána and benchmarked by a new criminal justice inspectorate which would incorporate the existing Garda Inspectorate. The criminal justice inspectorate we propose is based on what is in place in the North. It would include not just An Garda Síochána but the entire system of prisons, penal reform, the criminal justice system and the Courts Service. The Minister would be responsible for setting the overall long-term objectives for policing, after consultation with the new policing authority. The new Garda authority would be responsible for the effective and efficient delivery of the police service and would hold the Garda Commissioner to account directly.  Earlier this year my party launched our contribution, based on our experiences of all the submissions made in the State and those of our team which negotiated the changes to policing in the North. I do not say the former RUC was in any way comparable to An Garda Síochána, but there are lessons to be learned from the North in the context of the new beginning there, the Policing Board, the Police Ombudsman and the criminal justice inspectorate, which could be a useful contribution to reforms in the State. A copy of the document was circulated to all Oireachtas Members. I invite those who have not had the opportunity to do so to read it and give us constructive feedback. We do not claim to have all wisdom, but it is our humble contribution to this debate.  In terms of the unhealthy relationship we never again want to see develop, some 140 Garda stations have been closed across the State. Deputies from rural areas know the impact this has had. Garda districts were amalgamated with others. There was a 10% cut in staff, which has had a serious impact across the State. Whenever the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, was asked about it, he used terms such as ""modernisation"", ""efficiency"" and ""smart policing"". Every single garda to whom one spoke on the front line was disgusted, to coin a phrase, at the use of that defence by senior management. They could not believe what they were hearing. At the Garda Representative Association annual conference one could hear this year after year. The reason the former Garda Commissioner said those words and defended them was the unhealthy relationship that had been established over many years. There was a circle of trust where people defended each other.  Of course, when it came to criticism of senior of management in An Garda Síochána, the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, sat where the Minister of State is sitting and defended it, rejecting any criticism. He slapped us down time and again."	spk_4

We can never again have an unhealthy political relationship between the most senior police officer in the State and the Minister for Justice and Equality of the day, whereby they see it as being in their interests to protect each other and circle the wagons to protect themselves from criticism. The people who were failed most by that approach were the men and women of An Garda Síochána on the front line. In the future we need an independent approach free from political interference, which includes people who are representative of society, making decisions. The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality had an opportunity to examine the models used in the North and Scotland. The Minister of State will shortly have the chance to read our recommendations for change. I commend Deputy Niall Collins. I have worked with him and other members of the Opposition closely in the past while trying to bring forward alternative solutions. It is welcome that the Government will support the Bill and not vote against it on Second Stage next Tuesday. The Minister of State is committed to equality and reform. He now has an opportunity in the post he holds to see it through. If there is any resistance from anybody to the necessary reform which needs to happen or any delay or procrastination, I ask the Minister of State to fight the good fight and make sure the change materialises. Crises emerge in the evolution of a state and it sometimes takes these moments for change to happen. There is an opportunity to see through the reforms which are necessary, win back the confidence of the public in the justice system of the State and, most of all, to boost the morale of the men and women of An Garda Síochána, the vast majority of whom have done no wrong and serve us honourably and courageously every day. If they see change happening, it will be the best thing we have done.	spk_6
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-09-30	dail	31	Direct Provision for Asylum Seekers: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_28	"I welcome the Minister of State's statements on this subject since he took office. I referenced them last week during Question Time with the Minister. I must also put on the record again the sheer frustration we felt when we raised the matter with the previous Minister, Deputy Shatter, over the past three years. Both in this Chamber and in committee rooms, he repeatedly defended this system. He acknowledged some of the challenges but felt it was the best we could offer. It has been a really frustrating number of years, which is why a fresh approach is welcome. I believe the Minister of State will seek to address this issue, but I am a bit concerned about the Minister. I felt she was not using the same emphasis as the Minister of State in her statements last week. On reflection afterwards, I was fearful that we might not have a sense of urgency around this - a need to catch up with three lost years. I made the point to the Minister that, based on her response, I felt that there was a rowing back from some of the statements the Minister of State had made publicly and that there was a more cautious approach and a qualification around some of the comments that were being made. This is why I welcome this motion tonight. There is no legislative footing for these direct provision centres and they can be removed if the Government deems it necessary. I appreciate that the Government needs to put in place some type of system and to deal with the fact that there have been these crazy delays in the application process and that appeals run on for years. In 1987, I read a book by the late Ray Crotty which revealed that since the foundation of the Irish State, half of Irish citizens who survived childhood - not factoring in those who died during childhood - emigrated. From 1922 to 1987 - 65 years - half of all citizens who survived childhood emigrated from Ireland. That is our legacy. Today, as we speak, emigration is happening again - to Australia, the US, Canada, Great Britain and all over the world. Yet again, we are losing our young people to emigration. We would never for a moment tolerate our young people being treated the way we have treated people who have come to this country. Can one imagine ""Liveline"" with Joe Duffy and the discussion on every local radio station? There would be documentaries every week on every station in this State telling the stories. We would not put up with it. We would have dealt with it. Of all the nations on this earth, I would say that per capita, very few have our emigration levels. There are very few countries that have had to rely more on their brothers and sisters internationally to give them a future. I am not advocating an open-door system. There needs to be a process to ensure that people who genuinely need asylum are assessed properly. We have left people in these centres with food that is not culturally applicable. I listened to one of the reports on RTE radio about deep-fried food and frozen food served every day to people who are used to healthy and diverse choices. This is one of the less serious criticisms. I am talking about the way children are treated within the system. This has been ongoing for years and years. The way children are corralled into tight spaces is an appalling indictment of the way we made up that policy 14 years ago in response to very different circumstances. We have not dealt with the fact that they have changed dramatically.  I know the Minister of State is sincere about this and is trying to address it, but I hope his senior colleague has the same sense of urgency about this issue. This will be proved in the next period of time. We need to give the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner oversight of the direct provision system. They have repeatedly asked for it. The Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, will appear before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions tomorrow and I know he is going to ask for it again. He is also the Information Commissioner. We need to give oversight of this system to the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner because it is public money but, more importantly, because it is about people's rights. While they are not citizens of Ireland, we have received a welcome all over the world. The least we can do when people are waiting for a decision is to treat them with dignity and have oversight of that. I wish the Minister of State good luck with his work, and if he continues in the same light he will have the support of this side of the House."	spk_365

The food is outside of their cultural experience. I listened to some of the excellent journalistic reports on radio about deep-fried foods.

Therefore, we cannot look at how the money is spent or the type of food or accommodation provided.They are not truly held to account, even though taxpayers' money is paying for this. That is the first issue. The second issue is the reports of women in these centres turning to prostitution. I have seen the Minister's concerned remarks about that, but it is the inevitable outworking of a long-term situation when people find themselves trapped. I urge the Minister to move speedily on this. We lost three years with the Minister's predecessor who refused to accept that this is an issue. I welcome the language used by the Minister and her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, but it is time to move quickly.

There is a sham fight between the Labour Party and Fine Gael while families watch and hope there will be an end to austerity. Last week various Government Ministers trumpeted the improved Exchequer figures but the key point is that those figures give the opportunity to do the right thing. Citizens have faced repeated austerity budgets, cuts across the board to public services and tax increases. This has happened directly and through various stealth taxes. One cannot discuss recovery without giving families more money in their pockets, which can go back into the domestic economy. We cannot discuss a neutral budget while people are receiving application forms from Irish Water, Uisce Éireann, as we speak. People are wondering whether to give their personal public service, PPS, numbers and various details. How will people afford this extra charge? The Minister for Finance knows better than most that he has a choice.

We and the rest of the Opposition have called for this. All Deputies have been unnerved by recent developments in the Golan Heights. We all share real concern for the health and safety of Irish troops stationed there on the UNDOF mission. Irish Defence Forces personnel who have served on UN peacekeeping missions have been a credit to the country through their professional conduct and exceptional work. Sinn Féin is committed to positive Irish neutrality and an independent foreign policy. We believe Ireland should actively work to promote conflict resolution, peaceful democratic settlements and pathways and mechanisms to facilitate self-determination of peoples throughout the world. Our country's background in conflict resolution means Ireland can draw on many lessons which could be applied to other conflict situations. The State's history of serving in UN blue helmet peacekeeping missions is a matter of pride and enhances our standing as a neutral state. However, sending troops to the UNDOF mission is not a simple or straightforward decision. As we know, UNDOF was set up in 1974 to patrol and monitor the strip between Syria and Israel but it has been increasingly caught up in Syria's civil war, with rebel groups attacking UN bases and kidnapping peacekeepers. Ireland was asked to provide troops to the mission after Austria announced it was pulling its troops from the mission over security concerns and because the EU failed to renew its arms embargo on Syria. When we debated this issue on 18 July 2013, my colleague, Deputy Seán Crowe, made clear that Sinn Féin felt that the current mandate for UNDOF was not fit for purpose and that EU decisions, coupled with the continued erosion of Irish neutrality by consecutive Governments, robbed Irish troops of their neutrality on this mission. Sinn Féin voted against sending Irish troops on the UNDOF mission after that debate and we stand over that decision. Although Sinn Féin was against this deployment, we recognise that the Government got Dáil approval to deploy these troops, and we have used all opportunities to ensure their safety. That is of paramount concern to everybody in this House.  I know that almost all UN troops in the region are now deployed in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights area, including Irish troops, and that the UN Security Council released a statement last Friday strongly backing and unconditionally supporting the UNDOF mission. The statement also calls on the Secretary General of the UN to provide the Security Council with an update on the ""steps necessary to maintain UNDOF's ability to carry out its mandate"" within 30 days. Why did the Minister not wait for the publication of that draft report before making the recommendation to Cabinet which has been endorsed? Why did he not get more clarity on the changes that will be put in place and the reassurances that we require before making this decision?We have breaking news reports today that the US, with the support of some Arab countries, has carried out air strikes against ISIS targets in Syria. This further muddles the complexity of the Syrian war. Many neighbouring countries are supporting rebel and radical Islamist groups in a variety of direct and indirect ways, while symbolically helping the US to bomb ISIS targets supposedly without the approval of the Syrian Government. It has been reported that Islamic State fighters will now flee towards Kurdish areas. Kurdish defence forces have bravely fought off Islamic jihadists since 2012. Kurdish areas have become a haven for refugees fleeing persecution, but they may now be overrun. According to reports, over 60,000 Kurds have fled from ISIS in northern Syria - over the Turkish border - in the last few days. Sinn Féin fully supports the Government's humanitarian support to the vulnerable and impoverished Syrian population and refugees. It would support Government initiatives to increase the humanitarian aid and support supplied by the State. We believe aid should be sent to Kurdish regions in Iraq and Syria. This should be negotiated directly with Kurdish officials. All sides in the Syrian conflict need to begin a negotiated cessation of violence and enter into inclusive peace talks immediately. ISIS is known for its extremist and sectarian beliefs which have been brutally enforced in areas they have conquered, causing massive human rights abuses and executions. Sinn Féin condemns this militant group in the strongest possible way. I will summarise our concerns. The UN Security Council was divided from the beginning of the Syrian conflict. Its inaction allowed the conflict to continue without any resolution process being put in place. This had absolutely devastating consequences. The international community failed in this regard."	spk_287

The arms embargo that was removed by the EU before we went out there undermined our neutrality in that equation. A similar point can be made regarding the emergence of ISIS. It is clear that interested parties in Europe and the US were supporting rebels in Syria who were heavily financed by the Gulf states, which are allies of Europe and the West, apparently. Now we have the evolution of ISIS, which has been heavily financed by the Gulf states. The world needs to confront and defeat this despicable and reprehensible organisation. This is a scenario of mixed messages. It is a complex situation. The Filipino Government recently expressed its concerns about the UN instructions given to soldiers on the ground. This is a mess. Our concerns remain. We await the UN report about how it intends to reorient this mission. The Minister said last week - I am paraphrasing - that he does not want our Defence Forces to go into harm's way. We are all realists in this House. When we send our peacekeepers, of whom we are immensely proud, into peacekeeping operations while wearing the blue helmets of the UN, we know they might be in harm's way. Every one of them accepts that role fully, bravely and courageously. Many of them have died in the service of our country while peacekeeping across the world. We must not unnecessarily - for no good reason - put our troops in harm's way. That is the concern we continue to have. I hope we can get the clarification and reassurance we require in the time ahead.	spk_289

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-07-16	dail	31	Disability Services: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_35	"In these Houses all of us pledge allegiance to the 1916 Proclamation that hangs in the foyer. Therefore, we believe in a republic - a new republic - one where all citizens are equal, regardless of the colour of their skin, disability, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, where they live or what they do. Creating the conditions for establishing an equal society means recognising that many diverse groups and sections of society need enhanced protection from the State. In my time in the Dáil, and for a number of years before I was elected, I have witnessed cut after cut to those living with disabilities and those who love them and care for them. A total of 26 disability organisations saw their funding, through the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, run by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, revoked on 30 June. That is disgraceful. Our citizens deserve better. The Government must restore €1.2 million in funding lost to disability organisations. I echo some of the comments made by the Disability Federation of Ireland today. It expressed concern that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for implementing the national disability strategy, was apparently not aware of the serious cut implemented by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. It also expressed concern that the Minister of State no longer comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality and that there might be a disconnect between her disability and equality portfolios. The Government must be aware of that. I have no doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, will examine the matter. The Disability Federation of Ireland has also asked that the Government consider the appointment of a senior Minister for disability inclusion. Having just completed a reshuffle and rearranged some ministerial portfolios I do not assume the Government will do that immediately but in the absence of such a change I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, to examine the issue. There is ongoing concern on the matter among the disability community. I urge him also to secure a commitment from the new Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, his party colleague and deputy leader, to overturn the cuts and restore funding to those important organisations. They are providing critical front-line service to people who are most in need of them. We must do the right thing by disabled citizens. I have said it before in this House and I will say it again tonight, that we need a ""threshold of decency"" on disability supports and a political consensus that people with disabilities would have their dignity and rights maintained and that their families would not be abandoned as a result of ongoing cutbacks. We will not allow those with disabilities and their carers and families to endure cutbacks. I remind Members of this House of the imagery from 2012 of citizens with profound disabilities protesting outside Leinster House at the cuts imposed by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and how that struck a chord with people. The courage and dignity of those who braved the elements to make their stand shone a light on the reality. The Government has proceeded to enforce cut after cut on those with disabilities in this State, and their families and carers. Their broken promises on disabilities are the cruellest of all. The previous Government cut the disability allowance, carer's allowance and carer's benefit, and the blind person's allowance, not once but twice. The removal of the Christmas double payments also heavily impacted on the disabled and their families and carers. As a result, the Government cut the income of disabled people and their carers by 10% over two budgets. In my time as a Member of this House, and also previously as a councillor, I have engaged more with adults and children who have disabilities and that has been a real eye-opener for me. Life is hard but it is even harder for some of those people and their families. It is not just difficult for those with a disability; it is incredibly difficult for their loved ones around them. It is physically hard and emotionally draining. They are at the coalface. They are the ones who campaign day in and day out in their own ways for their loved ones to have the same standard of living as they have. Many of the speakers last night pointed out that it is also financially difficult for people with disabilities. We know that half of those with disabilities experience income poverty and more than one third experience basic deprivation. Since 2008, the sector has faced a 14% cut imposed by the Government. I would like the Minister of State to inform me why Ireland has not ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Surely that should have been done some time ago as we signed the convention in March 2007. Could he please tell me the reason for the delay? Could he also indicate when the Government will do the decent thing and introduce equality budgeting? In July 2013 Sinn Féin introduced the Equal Status (Amendment) Bill 2013. The Bill sought to amend the existing legislation and aimed to provide for equality proofing of Government policy and budgets and public bodies through impact assessments. Had the Bill been accepted and passed, it would have ensured that both the Government and public bodies in exercising their functions would do so in a way that is designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome which result from socioeconomic disadvantage. The Bill recognises those additional sectors of society which require enhanced protection from the State in relation to policy and spending decisions. We all know that times are hard in this country but what some of us fail to recognise is just how difficult they are for some of the poorest and most vulnerable in society. The Government came to office on a wave of promises in 2011 but soon afterwards it became apparent that many of its plans involved taking from some of the most vulnerable. Often, in order to create true equality we have to put the mechanisms in place to ensure that happens. This is one of those times. By using equality budgeting, we would ensure equality is placed well and truly at the centre of any decisions concerning public expenditure and income. Equality budgeting has been internationally accepted as a means to deal effectively with inequality and poverty. Worldwide, more than 60 countries have adopted or are working towards equality budgeting. The time has come for Ireland to follow suit, to make a stand and provide a more just and equitable society for all. It is our duty as republicans - Sinn Féin does not claim ownership of the description ""republican"". Everyone who pledges allegiance to the 1916 Proclamation, and believes in the values and principles inherent in it, is a republican. All of us who are republicans have a responsibility to consider equality budgeting. I endorse the vision for people with disabilities from the Disability Federation of Ireland. It called on the Government to take urgent action on three key areas. First, it urged the Government to halt reductions in the basic standard of living of people with disabilities requiring welfare supports. People with disabilities are most likely to experience real poverty because on top of the recent cuts in benefit levels and new charges, they also have to continue to pay for extras required due to their disability. Second, the Government must ensure funding for the services needed by people with disabilities. Cutting the services required by people with disabilities not only undermines their lives, it also leads to a growing public burden in terms of hospital stays and expensive care costs. Third, the Government must publish and show leadership on an ambitious implementation plan for the national disability strategy in keeping with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, where people have dignity, individual autonomy and full and effective participation in Irish society. That is the vision and the achievable goals the organisation has set out. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, believes in equality and is committed to it. I wish him well in his new brief. I will work constructively with him to achieve the goals we share.I commend Deputy Finian McGrath on bringing forward this motion, which we will support."	spk_659
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-07-15	dail	31	Court of Appeal Bill 2014: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_29	"I commend Deputy Creighton on her amendment. The issue here is one of perception. While I do not wish to use terms such as ""the majority"" or ""the overwhelming majority"", on the whole the Judiciary has served the State well. A lack of consistency in decision making, particularly in the District Courts, is an issue that arises regularly, although such issues could be addressed through the establishment of a sentencing council which provided clear sentencing guidelines to the Judiciary. There are various ways of addressing that issue. There remains a perception that many judicial appointments are based on the political affiliations of the person appointed. The Government has justifiably challenged the perception that the legal fraternity has regulated itself over the years. While the Judiciary has a system of regulation in place and there is also an independent adjudicator, the perception persisted that it was regulating itself. This perception is being addressed through the establishment of an independent legal services regulator. The issue is that we must deal once and for all with the perception. When one speaks of members of the Judiciary who have served the State well the Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, must feature at the top of the list. She has produced a measured set of proposals on behalf of fellow members of the Judiciary. A number of Deputies, including me, have introduced various Bills to address the issue. I flatter myself in stating that the Chief Justice's proposal was identical to mine in that it recommended having the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board draw up a short-list of three names, from which the Government would make an appointment, with provision also to have the reasons published. That is the purpose of the amendment.  The Legal Services Regulation Bill has been dragging on for three years. There is a myth abroad that the previous Minister took on vested interests who were popping champagne corks when he departed from office. They did not have much to fear given that it took three years to pass the legislation to establish an independent regulator and address a perception. The legislation will not address to any great extent the main issue facing people, namely, the cost of legal services. The idea that the previous Minister was courageously taking on vested interests was a myth and nonsense. He did not deal with this issue, but it could be dealt with so quickly. It is really frustrating. I commend Deputy Creighton for availing of this opportunity to raise the issue. I appreciate that we are not going to change the Minister's mind today, but the sooner she gets this perception of judicial appointments sorted out the better.  For example, there are people who had affiliations to political parties, as members or candidates, and that is okay. It may well be that a person ran for Fine Gael, Sinn Féin or Labour and happened to be the best person for the job. Somebody's political affiliation should not rule them out from being appointed to the Judiciary. If we have a transparent and open process that is beyond challenge, it takes away any negative perception. That is the issue. The sooner we get to that place the better and particularly for the Judiciary. It makes our job easier on this side of the House that somebody of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham's calibre has led the way in providing a solution. It is pretty much the solution that both I and Deputy Creighton have put forward in this amendment. If the Minister is not going to accept the amendment today, she should get the review concluded as soon as possible so as to address this matter."	spk_210

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-07-11	dail	31	Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill 2014: From the Seanad	dbsect_3	As I have said through the different Stages on this Bill, we had an Irish Human Rights Commission that did important work. The Equality Authority is doing important work also. A number of years ago the chairman of the Equality Authority had to resign because its budget was cut by 35% and he felt he was not in a position to fulfil his responsibilities on behalf of the citizens to hold Government to account. In recent weeks significant issues have arisen to do with the failure of the Government to meet its human rights responsibility. That will be raised with the Human Rights Council. This is not a great day for human rights in Ireland. This is the amalgamation of two authorities that were doing excellent work. It is about a consolidation. It undermines the Good Friday Agreement. How can we lecture Unionists in the North about the need for a human rights Bill and strengthening human rights infrastructure when we undermine ours and amalgamate the two authorities? I cannot accept that, particularly the lectures from the former Minister on this issue. We will be calling a vote on it. This is not a good day for human rights. There has been an undermining of the excellent work done by people who were undermined and faced budgetary cuts and setbacks throughout that period.	spk_61

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-07-11	dail	31	Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011: Report Stage	dbsect_4	The issue is that the Law Society and the Bar Council wish to continue to have their codes of practice along with that of the new authority. This is linked to their indemnity insurance. As bodies corporate they need to be able to stand over their codes of practice. The concern is that there is a change of language in the first amendment from code of conduct to code of practice yet the new section refers to a code of conduct. There seems to be some confusion around the definitions. Perhaps during the recess the Minister could consult with the Law Society and the Bar Council to clarify these issues. My next question is on a linked matter. Is it the Minister's intention to accept the proposals of the Law Society and the Bar Council to the effect that they would be able to continue to have their codes of practice in parallel with the new authority? Is that the intention? There is some confusion about the matter.	spk_72
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-07-11	dail	31	Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011: Report Stage	dbsect_4	The Law Society circulated its observations on the Minister's amendments. The Minister probably got a copy of the document as well. Clarification is required on the matter. I appreciate we are debating amendment No. 1 but it is linked to the removal of section 20 and its replacement. What the Minister is proposing is far broader in terms of a code of practice and oversight. We are not going to deal with the replacement of section 20 today; we will do so after the summer recess. Will the Minister avail of the summer recess to engage in dialogue with the Law Society and the Bar Council on these matters to clarify them? I appreciate that the Minister wants to ensure that new regulatory authority has oversight and can ensure that professionalism and standards are maintained. The Minister must ensure that but I am asking for a balance to be struck with the needs of the two bodies corporate to deal with indemnity insurance and to demonstrate, as any body must, that their standards are at a level that protects them. This balance needs to be struck. This is a reasonable point made by the two groups. I call on the Minister clarify these matters during the summer recess.	spk_74

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-07-11	dail	31	Court of Appeal Bill 2014: Second Stage	dbsect_5	"A referendum was required to make the necessary constitutional provision for the establishment of the Court of Appeal. The referendum took place on 4 October 2013 and it was carried by 65% of the people. The new court will hear appeals from the High Court and the Supreme Court, cases on appeal from the Court of Appeal and, in exceptional circumstances, from the High Court. This reform will bring about a major change in the courts system and ease the four year backlog of cases at the Supreme Court, which will in future take only appeals on constitutional issues or cases of major importance. Currently, important cases of a constitutional nature must wait for three and four years to be heard. This should not be the case; it is simply not acceptable. I welcome that this legislation seeks to resolve this important challenge. I refer to the issue of judicial appointments, which is linked to these changes. I launched the Reform of Judicial Appointments Procedures Bill 2013 early this year and it was debated in this Chamber. I launched it in the hope that it would put an end to the system of political appointees being made judges. Our Bill would amend the way in which the JAAB operates to increase transparency and accountability in judicial appointments, which is badly needed. Confidence in the justice system is contingent on a Judiciary that is free from political appointment or bias. It is essential that there be an independent and impartial Judiciary, which is representative of the community it serves. Future judicial appointments should be drawn from a wider pool of qualified candidates, which, in turn, would enhance confidence in the justice system. For too long we have all been aware of stories the length and breadth of the State of judges being appointed with a wink and nod after demonstrating their loyalty to whichever major party was in government at the time. The days of the old boys and girls club that dominates the legal and political spheres in Ireland must come to an end. Such an approach has failed our people. The sheer number of politically affiliated judges adds to an embedded public perception of the Judiciary, which is that it is an elite to whom the law of the land does not apply equally. I appreciate the Minister has put in place the review process. The reform group is led by one of the most respected members of the Judiciary, the Chief Justice, Ms Susan Denham. She said shortlists lead to the perception of politically influenced appointments and such a perception undermines the Judiciary. That is important coming from somebody of her standing and character. Even if our Bill, which is almost identical to the proposition put forward by the Chief Justice, is not taken, her proposition must be.  We are calling for the establishment of a fair and accountable appointment and removal process for the Judiciary, which involves meaningful lay participation representative of the public interest. Sinn Féin believes that judicial independence is undermined by the current appointment process. The JAAB was established in the wake of the controversial appointment of Harry Whelehan as President of the High Court in 1994 and was meant to have removed sole discretion for judicial appointments from Government. However, there is still political involvement in the appointment of the Judiciary, as the JAAB merely provides a list of seven qualified candidates to the Government, which then makes the appointments of judicial office holders. The appointment procedures should be transparent to enhance public confidence in the process. The shortlist should be reduced to three and the reason for appointment should be outlined. Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised a reforming government and an end to the ""jobs for the boys and girls"" culture but it is clear from their judicial appointments so far, many of their political friends, unfortunately, have been elevated. A report by Dearbhail McDonald in the I refer to the cost to the people taking such cases. Access to the courts and to justice is a constitutional right, yet the expense of cases can run into high figures, thereby acting as a barrier to people seeking to exercise this right. If cases move faster, the chance of reducing costs is better. The plan envisages that the new court of appeal will deal with most cases that are currently dealt with by the Supreme Court, which would, therefore, reduce the higher court’s workload and allow it to focus on the development of the law. Cost is the issue that drove the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 from the perspective of the troika and our international partners. However, we have discussed the heads of the mediation Bill and if that proceeds through the Oireachtas, that will have a greater impact on costs. We want people in family law and civil law cases to go down the road of mediation. The first instinct in a dispute is to go to a solicitor and cases drag on whereas trained mediators can prevent significant, unnecessary costs. I will work with the Minister to advance that legislation. There will be two tests to decide what type of appeals the Supreme Court will hear: that they are of ""public importance"" or where that it is ""in the interests of justice"" that the appeal by heard by the highest court in the State. In ""exceptional circumstances"", where these tests of public interest and ""the interests of justice"" are met, the Supreme Court will hear appeals directly from the High Court. The Supreme Court, unlike equivalent institutions in other common law jurisdictions, is the court of final appeal, not only for constitutional matters but for all appeals from the lower courts.Figures published last year by the Courts Service show that the court had received 605 appeals in the previous year, a 21% increase on the figure for 2011, and that it had given judgments in 121 cases, compared to 64 in the United States Supreme Court and 85 in the Supreme Court in London. I welcome the creation of a new court which will allow proceedings to take place within a reasonable time. An inefficient court system is costly because runaway legal costs hamper even small businesses and I welcome the initiative to end them. I offer my support and that of my party for the Bill and ask the Minister to take on board some of the concerns I have highlighted."	spk_117
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-07-01	dail	31	Mental Health Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_34	I commend this motion as for too many years, the whole area of mental health has been the Cinderella of the health service. Over the years while growing up and in common with many people, when visiting different towns I wondered what was this big house or what was the history of that big building. One often was told that it was the psychiatric hospital, which was where people were put out of the way. We lost our humanity somewhere along the way. In ancient civilisations such as, for example, in Roman times, if one visited a friend who was suffering from mental health issues, they had a phrase that the person was in Saturn. It was understood that such people were taking time out. They might be going for a walk or writing poetry. They were taking time out. Their family and friends supported them and they would be back again when they were ready. This was fully understood and the same applied in our ancient Celtic civilisation. Throughout all of history and in all the various civilisations, records exist of support being available when mental health issues arose.In the industrial era people became units of profits and labour and we lost our humanity. If people did not show up for work, they were not paid and could not pay their bills. They were expected to toughen up and get on with it. We are supposed to have come a long way, learned lessons and adopted a community-centred approach. This motion is important because the supports required at community level - the key personnel who must be appointed to perform vital functions - are not in place.  Like my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, I commend the individuals, community groups and non-governmental organisations in civic society that have filled the gap. They have, for example, developed strategies on suicide prevention, introduced supports and provided the infrastructure the Government and its predecessors have failed to establish. We have heard much rhetoric and many commitments and promises have been made, but none has been delivered. It was remarkable that, until recently, there were delays in filling almost every key post dealing with mental health supports in County Donegal. Not all of these delays can be blamed on the moratorium on public sector recruitment. Those providing front-line psychiatric services are extremely critical of the delivery of services, especially the slow pace involved.  A national campaign is required on suicide awareness, similar to the successful campaigns on road safety. We need to see people telling their stories. In addition, supports must be provided on the ground.  Every Member of the Oireachtas will have known someone who has taken his or her life. In some cases, they will have been people we loved and we did not see the signs. As with deaths from road traffic collisions, not every case of suicide can be prevented, regardless of what one does. Nevertheless, the number of deaths by suicide could be significantly reduced if supports were provided in communities. We must meet people halfway. I refer to the fantastic individuals across the State who spend an unbelievable amount of time working on this issue. They will deliver volunteer hours if they are provided with the supports they need. Every Deputy could tell stories about dynamic projects in their constituencies. In County Donegal, for example, we have youth mental health projects that have been developed and are led by young people.  The motion before us is a call to action that is necessary because we have had too many unfulfilled promises. We hope the Government can deliver resources in communities to show that Ireland has genuinely moved forward from the dark days of the big house on the hill where we locked away those we were ashamed of and failed to show decency or compassion. If we are to demonstrate that we have learned from the past and moved on, we must invest resources to match the fine words and plans that have been laid out.	spk_414

There were serious concerns from the get-go not only among the family but also in the wider community. When GSOC sought to investigate the matter initially, it did so pursuant to section 94(5) of the 2005 Act, which provides for a supervised investigation.

The lesson is that in moving forward there must be full co-operation from An Garda Síochána with GSOC to allow public confidence to be restored.	spk_9

At the same time every year we debate this. Every year we in Sinn Féin oppose it and argue for more time to debate it and every year we are denied and the motion passes. We all will be aware of the background to the Offences against the State Act and I am not going to rehash it yet again today. This legislation undermines human rights, civil liberties and democratic life in this State. It can no longer be denied that the continued use of draconian provisions such as those up for renewal today is untenable. We are living in a new political reality and there remains a duty for the Minister and the Government to live up to their obligations under the Good Friday Agreement to deliver security normalisation. The provisions up for renewal, and, indeed, the Offences against the State Acts in their entirety, have no place in the present or future of this island. The apathy of too many in the Opposition and throughout these Houses on this issue, and the ill-advised and wrongly placed enthusiasm of others for these measures, has obvious negative implications for Irish society. We call on every Member in this House to vote against the Government motion and to campaign for the repeal of the Offences against the State Acts in their entirety. There is an onus on us to uphold and implement in full the Good Friday Agreement. Our international commitments are not the only reason for us to oppose the motion. The Government has certain obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. The agreement places an onus on both Governments to work towards the normalisation of the security apparatus in the Twenty-six Counties and the Six Counties, and, as every Member of this House will be aware, the Agreement was endorsed overwhelmingly by the majority of the people on this island. It needs to be protected and implemented in full. In the past, many Members have argued in favour of the provisions of the Act because they have played a role. Today, I do not think anyone can truthfully argue that these provisions have a place in the present or future of this State. Sinn Féin believes the legislation is counterproductive in the long run. The retention of these provisions is an admission of the failure of this and previous Governments. The challenge to us is to prove that we have a normal society and that normal policing will convict those who seek to undermine it. There is no place in our society for the emergency legislation that was passed in 1998. Draconian legislation can never be a substitute for robust law and strong and accountable policing. As Members in this Chamber will be aware, Sinn Féin has consistently opposed the retention of this amendment. We have argued each year that it should be repealed in its entirety. At this time, there is neither a need for such legislation nor an argument in favour of it. The continuation of it will only serve to erode further the human rights ethos in which this State's legislation should be grounded. If Members in this Chamber truly value the concept of human rights, I implore them to vote accordingly and reject the motion. We are a normal society and the existing laws are strong enough if properly resourced. Sinn Féin has always been in the minority in this House in recent years when we have rightly opposed the 1998 Act. I imagine that we will be in a minority again today. We are not in a minority internationally, however, as we analyse this measure. The United Nations Human Rights Committee shares our stance on it. An Garda Síochána and the courts can convict and ensure that those who carry out acts of violence in this day and age serve a proper sentence for those actions. We must make every attempt to convince so-called dissident groups to move away from violence, embrace peace and accept the will of the people as expressed in the Good Friday Agreement. We must also convince them of the opportunities that the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process give republicans to further the republican and all-island agenda, and that is where our focus for the next 12 months should be. I ask Members to vote against this measure. I will speak briefly about the issue of so-called dissident activities. In recent years, there has been virtually zero support for them. There is, possibly, one councillor on the island who would offer any support or succour to them. Unfortunately, considerable elements have resorted to criminality. In essence, they are criminals. They are involved in criminal activities to line their own pockets to enrich themselves. They are not republicans. They could not be further from it. They are criminals. There may well be some among them who hold the republican view. In terms of those who are not involved in activities that enrich themselves, our challenge in these Houses is to engage with them and demonstrate the benefits of the peace process. Frankly, if one looks at the role of the British and Irish Governments in recent years, they seem to have been more interested in their own particular agendas than in driving through the peace process. With regard to the Haass talks, we had a situation in which neither the British nor the Irish Government had engagement.They allowed a situation whereby two hard-working, well-intentioned, respected international figures came in, yet we were abandoned to the election ambitions of the unionist political parties. There has been a complete disengagement both by the British and Irish governments from the process as regards how we deal with the legacies of the past.  There have been issues concerning on-the-runs where everybody declared they knew nothing about it and had no knowledge of it. Clearly, however, it was a part of the peace process that those who had been caught up in the conflict, and were no longer wanted, could return to normal life. There has been a lack of leadership in demonstrating the benefits of the peace process. Where are the economic benefits of the peace process for people living in working class areas, including Border areas like County Donegal? What economic benefits have accrued? That is the message to defeat those who would engage in these activities.  These types of laws are self-defeating because they almost make martyrs of some people by avoiding due process. The real challenge for these Houses is to demonstrate to communities that are suffering economically or politically that there are real and tangible benefits from the peace process. Can we have a re-engagement by both Governments to deal with the outstanding issues from the past and give victims on all sides answers about what happened to their loved ones? As an Irish republican, I stand ready to play my part, and my party will play its part, in helping that process at any stage. That is the challenge. I will now turn to the motion regarding the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009. Admitting that the ordinary courts are not adequate to deal with individuals who are involved in organised criminal activity is a sad reflection on any government or state. In such circumstances, the state in question has failed to deal with issues like jury intimidation and witness protection. If we are serious about dealing with organised criminal gangs, we need to put resources in place. I am sure those involved in organised criminal activity see the introduction of legislation to ensure they are tried before the Special Criminal Court as an admission of the State's failure to provide protections and safeguards to those who serve on juries. It is the wrong way to go and we will oppose this proposal for that reason. That is not flippantly to disregard the activities of these criminal gangs. We understand they cause misery and hardship, and have no regard for law and order. If we examine best international practice, we will see that other countries have found more effective ways of dealing with organised criminal gangs that do not involve institutions like the Special Criminal Court. The Special Criminal Court has been criticised by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Amnesty International and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, for its procedures and for being a special court which ordinarily should not be used against civilians. Among the criticisms are the lack of a jury and the increasing use of the court to try organised ordinary crimes rather than the terrorist cases it was originally set up to handle. Amnesty International considers that under international standards and the law of Ireland, the onus is upon the Government to demonstrate that special courts are essential in current circumstances, in the words of the law because ""the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order"". The Government has not done so. On the contrary, the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court is not restricted to offences related to the extraordinary circumstances which led to its establishment. There is information available which shows that an increasing number of cases, which are not obviously related to offences against the State, are being tried in the Special Criminal Court, largely as a result of the exercise by the Director of Public Prosecutions of the power to certify cases involving other than scheduled offences for trial in the Special Criminal Court. This is simply unacceptable. The Minister cannot argue for the retention of outdated legislation while at the same time implementing considerable cutbacks to An Garda Síochána and taking away its resources to combat criminality in communities across the State. There is a contradiction in the argument and for that reason, we will oppose both motions."	spk_88
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-06-19	dail	31	Cooke Report: Statements	dbsect_38	"In the shadowy world of modern surveillance, it is extremely difficult to definitively prove that surveillance has taken place. As said in various media interviews, it is not like in the old movies where one can unscrew one's telephone and find a bug or take the mirror from the wall and find a bug behind it. It is very difficult to prove but what we can say with certainty is that such was the toxic relationship between the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and senior management of An Garda Síochána, the Commission entertained the possibility that elements of An Garda Síochána - authorised or unauthorised - had it under surveillance illegally. That is an incredible situation to have reached. Let us rewind the tape back to the Kieran Boylan affair. Kieran Boylan was a convicted major drug dealer suspected of being responsible for €1.7 million worth of cocaine and heroin discovered by the national drugs unit in a very solid operation in October 2005. He was in custody suspected of being involved in this major drugs find but somehow by July 2008, the charges were dropped against Kieran Boylan without any explanation. There is a range of other issues which give rise to serious concerns about why this was the case. There are suspicions that he was a Garda informer and that situations were resolved for him because of that relationship. It would be quite remarkable if that was the case because usually informers are the small guys who help to bring in the big fish. One could argue that there is a public interest in that type of situation where one gets to the big players by working with the smaller ones. However, in this case, a big player - a major convicted drug dealer - was suspected of assisting gardaí in not only capturing but imprisoning smaller drug dealers. It was a reverse of the usual approach and that is why it caused such huge public concern. If true, it would be absolutely shocking and appalling.  The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission initiated its public interest investigation after all of these very worrying developments. It is very clear from its own report that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission was delayed by a lack of co-operation from senior Garda management over a four-year period. We had a situation where all the protocols of senior Garda Síochána management releasing documentation to the commission within a 30-day period were, in almost all cases, broken. In one case, documentation was not submitted to the commission even after four years. This very important public interest investigation was repeatedly delayed because of the appalling lack of co-operation from the senior management of An Garda Síochána.  I understand that GSOC released not only a seven-page summary document of its report to the Department, but submitted a 600-page report on all of this to the office of the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, and to the Director of Public Prosecution. There is a very detailed report around the Kieran Boylan affair, all of the issues and all the concerns in the Minister's office. I ask the Minister to release that report into the public domain, although I appreciate she will have to do so on a redacted basis, because it will be very revealing about the real challenges the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission faced in trying to get to the truth of something that was clearly in the public interest. If the concerns prove to be true - I am not saying they are - it would be a major scandal in terms of what was happening. Some of the people who were being asked to co-operate with documentation were suspected of having facilitated this whole arrangement. That was the scale of what we were dealing with at that time.  In its seven-page summary, GSOC stated that it felt - this is very serious - that the lessons of the Morris tribunal had not been learned in terms of the handling of informers, which was core to many of the corruption issues in regard to the Morris tribunal, and the retention of contemporaneous notes. There was no way to see why decisions were made, what happened and so on. GSOC had grave concerns around all of this.  It is incredible that for months after this seven-page summary was published, the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, kept schtum. He did not say a word about the fact that for four years, senior management in An Garda Síochána did not release some documentation and delayed other documentation for years which was crucial for GSOC to do its job in the public interest.Nothing was said about that by the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, for months. Finally, under sustained pressure from the Opposition, protocols were drawn up which I hope will now ensure that An Garda Síochána senior management fully co-operates with the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, so that it can be seen to do its job in the public interest. That was the environment that led to the remarkable situation where the three members of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission entertained the potential that elements of An Garda Síochána, either authorised or unauthorised, were surveilling illegally upon them. That is a profound issue. We know now that GSOC brought in Verrimus following a recommendation from its sister organisation in England. Verrimus is an internationally respected security organisation. Many of its staff have experience in the security world. They know it very well and they understand the techniques and modern technology used as well as the evasion techniques used to cover people’s tracks. They know what they are doing. A company of its stature advised GSOC that there were a number of potential threats. I still believe that given the type of expertise involved, in addition to the other issues Verrimus uncovered, given the lack of co-operation, procrastination and resistance GSOC faced from senior Garda management in the new dispensation in which members were being held accountable for their actions, it was justified in setting up a public interest investigation to take matters to the next level. We will never know for sure what happened. It is difficult to get definitive evidence. However, what we do know is quite alarming. Everyone was waiting for the report last week. As Opposition spokespersons we were all asked by the media whether we were on stand-by to give a response. We said we needed a chance to read through the report or at least to read the conclusions and recommendations before giving a response. We waited and eventually at 8.45 p.m. the report was released on the evening in question. The Minister gave a simultaneous press release at Government Buildings and she appeared on the ""Prime Time"" programme to convey the Government’s message on it. Essentially, the message was that there was nothing to see and it was time to move on. I am interested in the latter part of the message because one must learn the lesson and put in place a response. I am still not convinced there is nothing to see. When I read through the entire report a number of issues gave rise to concern, not least conclusion 15. Reference has been made to it but I will read it into the record because it is useful. It states: ""in the somewhat febrile world of covert surveillance and counter-surveillance techniques, it is ultimately extremely difficult to determine with complete certainty whether unexplained anomalies of the kinds identified in this instance were or were not attributable to unlawful intrusion."" Mr. Justice Cooke acknowledged in conclusion 16 that there may be a need for further investigation but he does not recommend it. However, it is not quite a case of there being nothing to see. Despite the media briefings during the day that GSOC was going to have egg on its face, Mr. Justice Cooke acknowledged in conclusion 11 that it had acted in good faith. One could ask what else it was to do when presented with those matters. I acknowledge that he criticises GSOC's decision to go ahead with a public interest investigation and he also criticised its failure to inform the Minister when the investigation was completed. GSOC argues that its interpretation of the legislation is somewhat different. I draw the Minister’s attention to the reference in the report to the white van with blacked out windows on the street. Many Verrimus operatives are former intelligence agents trained by MI5 or the CIA. They are not greenhorns. They know the techniques of surveillance. They felt it noteworthy to report the van to Mr. Justice Cooke and to put Verrimus’s reputation on the line. I find that intriguing. They also drew attention to the man going into the coffee shop with a bag and an object in a box. What worries me most however is the incident in the airport where a man with a bag over his shoulder sought to take a photograph. The operatives turned away but he took a photograph when they turned around again. That is known as being burnt in the surveillance world; when the opposition sends a clear warning. Mr. Justice Cooke acknowledged that if spying took place it was on Verrimus not GSOC. I am very concerned about those matters, in particular given the type of people who reported them, because they know what surveillance is and they understand the techniques. That demonstrates to me that surveillance was taking place. Something was going on that was sanctioned by agencies of this State. I do not buy into a low-level criminal interest in GSOC. Somebody sanctioned by this State felt it necessary to be involved in some level of surveillance. That is my view based on what I read in the report. I appreciate that the terms of reference given to Mr. Justice Cooke meant that as a retired High Court judge he could not convict somebody nor could he send someone to prison. He could not press charges based on the evidence he had. The threshold was set high. However, he could clearly not rule out that something had happened. He was in a dilemma and he erred on the side of caution. That is fair enough. I appreciate that he had a job to do, but the terms of reference were somewhat limited. We will never know for sure what happened but I am giving my tuppence worth. I believe that something toxic happened due to the relationship between senior management of An Garda Síochána and GSOC. Some things had not changed in terms of the culture that was so exposed by the Morris tribunal, one that revealed an abuse of power and that was supposed to have been reined in by GSOC and the new Garda Inspectorate. The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality met the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland in the North last week. Its members have the same security clearance as any police officer. It has a responsibility to look for everything. When it commences an investigation in the public interest it demands full co-operation. There is some conflict with the PSNI about that at the moment but the ombudsman is very clear that its members have access to everything in the course of carrying out investigations. There is no such thing as security concerns or the view that they are not up to the same standard as members of the police force. One could ask why no Minister or spokesperson on behalf of the Government has said one word in anger about the fact that for four years the former Garda Commissioner refused to hand over documentation to GSOC in a public interest investigation. Concerns were expressed that a major convicted drug dealer got away with €1.7 million worth of heroin and cocaine without explanation because he was working as an informer to pinpoint smaller drug dealers to make some gardaí look good. That is the allegation. That is extremely serious yet when GSOC sought to investigate the matter thoroughly in order to allay public concern it was utterly frustrated over a four-year period. Nobody in government has said a word in anger about all of that. Nobody in government has said it is absolutely outrageous that the senior management of An Garda Síochána did not fully co-operate and give every item of documentation sought in order to reach a speedy conclusion to the investigation. It is clear that GSOC found itself in a situation where it could not do its job. It is deeply worrying that it got to the point that it entertained and still holds the view that it was possibly being surveilled upon by elements of this State.It is clear that Verrimus believes there was physical surveillance, not just Internet surveillance. These are extremely serious matters. We are discussing a review today, not a commission of investigation, because Mr. Justice Cooke did not have the ability to compel documents or witnesses or make adverse findings of fact. It was merely a review and I accept that he gave it the best he could. There are contradictions in his review. He struggled with having to decide and could not reach the threshold he required. The report raises more questions than it answers and I worry that a person in an agency of the State felt it was acceptable not to co-operate with a public interest investigation by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. Further, this person then felt it acceptable to keep a close eye on the affairs of an independent ombudsman who functions on behalf of the people to investigate our concerns. Will the Minister release the 600-page report by the Garda Ombudsman into the Kieran Boylan affair? The Minister may take advice from the Attorney General as to whether to redact it but it should be released into the public domain so a spotlight can be shone on the period. The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, failed to make a statement expressing a view on how long it took the investigation to receive documentation and the fact that some was never handed over. Will the Minister do so? We will never know some things but the Government can assist with other things. There is consensus on the fact that the powers of the Garda ombudsman must be strengthened. We must amend legislation so that all ranks of gardaí, from those on the front desk to the Garda Commissioner, must co-operate fully with investigations carried out by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. This must be done quickly and without procrastination. We must have an independent Garda authority to hold all gardaí to account. We need a new beginning. I have played football and served on community groups and committees with members of the Garda Síochána. The overwhelming majority are people of outstanding decency and character, patriots who seek to serve the State. However, a corrosive culture exists all the way up to top-ranking senior management and it has failed those gardaí. They are demoralised and need a fresh start. I am proud of the vast majority of the men and women of the Garda Síochána and how they have served us through the years but I am ashamed of the behaviour of some of them. I am ashamed of some of the issues that necessitated the investigation carried out by Mr. Justice Cooke. Whatever we do, those issues must be resolved. We must use this crisis as an opportunity for a new beginning. The Garda Síochána is a service, not a force. We must ensure the men and women who join that service can be confident they can progress through the ranks if they have the ability. When they speak out against wrongdoing they must be heard and protected. When members of the public raise issues those matters must be fully investigated by a strong ombudsman that is not blocked in any way. These are the challenges that lie ahead."	spk_264

The least we can expect is for members of the Defence Forces to have the ability like any other citizen to make direct representations to their public representatives.	spk_58
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-06-18	dail	31	Military Aircraft Landings	dbsect_8	In my view Deputies should not make representations around matters such as transfers and overseas postings. That should be a matter for the command structure, based on merits and so on. There is a perception among members of the Defence Forces that they cannot make any representations to public representatives and there is a huge fear around that. It is important to make it clear, for example, if they are allowed to express their concerns around the impact on their families of travelling significant distances because of the re-arrangement of the brigade structure in the State. Are they allowed to talk collectively about the impact of closures of barracks on their communities and make representations on that? It is important it is clarified what matters are appropriate, and what are not, on which members of the Defence Forces can make representations. The AGSI, Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, recently won a case in Europe to give it trade union rights.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-06-18	dail	31	Defence Forces Personnel	dbsect_11	Something that frustrates public representatives is the inability of members of the Defence Forces to make representations directly on issues of concern. The people are proud of our Defence Forces and we owe them a great debt for all they have done for us. The least we can expect is for members of the Defence Forces to have the ability like any other citizen to make direct representations to their public representatives.	spk_58
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-06-18	dail	31	Defence Forces Personnel	dbsect_11	In my view Deputies should not make representations around matters such as transfers and overseas postings. That should be a matter for the command structure, based on merits and so on. There is a perception among members of the Defence Forces that they cannot make any representations to public representatives and there is a huge fear around that. It is important to make it clear, for example, if they are allowed to express their concerns around the impact on their families of travelling significant distances because of the re-arrangement of the brigade structure in the State. Are they allowed to talk collectively about the impact of closures of barracks on their communities and make representations on that?

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-06-18	dail	31	Public Sector Management (Appointment of Senior Members of the Garda Síochána) Bill 2014: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_37	I commend Deputy Ross on his Bill. Given the various scandals that have emerged in the administration of justice, we need to challenge the political control of policing and particularly the appointment of senior police officers by a Minister and, in turn, backed by the Government. We have seen various examples of this. The former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, announced the closure of 140 Garda stations and a 10% cut in Garda numbers. In some Garda districts the cutbacks ran to a level of almost 30%, while hundreds of Garda vehicles were also cut. All of this was described as efficiency, modernisation and smart policing by the former Commissioner, to the fury of his own men and women serving on the ground right up to sergeant and inspector level. The lower and middle Garda ranks were furious about the position taken by the former Garda Commissioner. The former Minister for Justice and Equality repeatedly protected the former Garda Commissioner and senior gardaí from proper accountability and analysis of their performance. We had that unhealthy situation for far too long, so we clearly need to see the independent appointment of senior gardaí. Sinn Féin has published its own proposals on these matters. We want to see the promised new Garda authority - and I believe it will happen - appointing the Garda Commissioner along with the deputy and assistant commissioners. Last week, members of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality had an opportunity to visit our opposite numbers in the North. We also met the Police Ombudsman up there and the PSNI board. The following day we went to Scotland to meet the new police authority that oversees Police Scotland. Up to recent years, the Scottish police had eight constabularies, while there is now one with a Chief Constable accountable to the Scottish Police Authority. That authority appoints senior police, while the PSNI appoints senior police in Northern Ireland. The PSNI board has 19 members, ten of which are serving politicians appointed by the d'Hondt system which is based on the strength of political parties or independents. That board recently unanimously appointed a Chief Constable, which is quite remarkable in a divided society. They have every confidence in the new Chief Constable. There is rigorous accountability and most of their business meetings are held in public session. That is the way to go and it is what we want to see. We want to support Deputy Ross's Bill as an interim measure but we need safeguards and assurances prior to the establishment of the new Garda authority. Given the scale of the crisis and the challenges we face, there is now a political consensus that we need an independent Garda authority. We trust that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, will ensure that happens. The Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will soon be making unanimous recommendations on an all-party basis. I have no doubt we will recommend the type of model we would like to see. Clearly, we want to see an independent Garda authority but it remains to be decided how many people will sit on it, if it will have political representatives, and what will be the scope of its responsibilities. One of the issues that arose in Scotland concerned an inevitable tension in this new dispensation whereby the new authority was in conflict with senior police on issues including budgets and human resources. Their advice to us was to ensure the legislation is very clear on what the new Garda authority will do and what it has control over, so there is no unnecessary conflict at the start. The model we propose is for a Garda authority with 20 members from a variety of backgrounds, including legal, human rights, academic, civil society and law enforcement expertise. While we believe there should be political representation, it should be in a minority on that board and based on the d'Hondt allocation system. Our colleagues in the North have testified how well that has worked. Of course, they have disagreements but in the main they work together to ensure they can deliver a new policing model. It is an exciting time despite the crisis we have had. To borrow from the Chinese philosophy, the flip side of crisis is opportunity. We now have a real opportunity to complete the unfinished business that followed the Morris tribunal. We had the Garda Síochána Act 2005 which brought in the new Garda Ombudsman and the Garda Inspectorate. However, we now need to see a profound change in the relationship between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the police. An independent Garda authority is required. We also need to see a change in culture throughout the organisation. The mistake we made was to bring in the oversight model but without a shadow of a doubt the Garda Ombudsman did not have the requisite powers to fulfil its responsibilities. However, we did not seek a change in the existing culture of An Garda Síochána from the person at the front desk right up to the Garda Commissioner. When she first took up her new portfolio, I heard the Minister say in a radio interview that it is a closed culture. I entirely agree with her. Police services tend to be closed cultures. They have a command structure and it tends to be an attitude of everybody being in this together. We need to find a way of maintaining that loyalty and team approach while at the same time creating a space whereby real criticism and analysis can take place. Minor complaints, such as how a Garda in a station dismissed somebody's concerns, should not have to go through the legalities of GSOC. That type of issue should be resolved by local Garda management with the Garda involved feeling comfortable in saying that he or she could have handled that better. A degree of common sense needs to be introduced. I am sure the Minister is already examining models in the North and elsewhere. We can learn an awful lot from models in the North and in Scotland. They have already been through many teething problems and challenges that we do not need to go through because we can learn from their experience.I look forward to working with the committee to put forward our recommendations. Deputy Ross has rightly tried to guarantee in legislation that an independent system will be established for the appointment of senior police officers. I am sure he will agree that when the new Garda authority comes into being, it should have the power to hire the Garda Commissioner, the deputy commissioner and assistant commissioners and, if need be, to fire them. They need to have those teeth from the outset. We support allowing this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage because we believe it is a worthwhile intervention. However, we hope it will not be necessary and that the new Garda Commissioner will be appointed through an open process managed by the Public Appointments Service and ratified by the new independent Garda authority.	spk_378
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-06-10	dail	31	Death and Burial of Children in Mother and Baby Homes: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_30	Whenever we start to digest the full horror of all the stories that have emerged not recently but for several years we must go back to its roots. Where did it all go wrong? What was at the root of it? Let us consider this building, in particular. We are surrounded by the leaders of the 1916 Rising and icons of our struggle for independence. They helped to formulate the Proclamation, the vision for the people, that is to be found in the main foyer and which represents the hopes and ambitions they had for the people. Their thoughts would have been framed by the Dublin of 1913, as reported on during the Lock-out, when the conditions of poverty were even worse than on the streets of Calcutta. The city had some of the most appalling examples of poverty in the world and that was the challenge that faced the new State. We thought we had had a revolution. We thought we would develop a state of which we could be proud and that would address this poverty with real gusto. What we got was a counter-revolution. What we got was people who were mean and cruel in their conservatism, who wanted to control the lives of others. They turned the colonial institutions that had been so hated by the people into even worse manifestations of what they had been previously. The people who ran these institutions professed to be Christian. I am a Christian and have faith in Christ. When I think of Christ, I think of love, empathy, compassion and everything that could be beautiful and challenging about this life. I do not think of malice or cruelty. I do not think of a desire to isolate and punish vulnerable women, push them away, take their children from them or have them adopted, vaccinated or let them die from malnutrition. All of this was for some ideology or to adhere to the teachings of Christ and this is what was done in our name. We are all part of it because we knew it was happening in our communities. We knew about the young women who had been banished to these institutions. We knew about the children who had escaped and had subsequently been sent back to these institutions. There had to have been reports in newspapers.Where were the coroners? Were there coroners' reports into these deaths and were they published in local newspapers? This is the great shame of our people. It is based on a deeply conservative, malicious and cruel interpretation of faith, one that seeks to imprison people rather than liberate them, one that seeks to be cruel to them rather than give them the love, empathy and compassion they deserve. Government after Government protest when they must deal with issues like this. We will have another commission and more findings, speeches and apologies from the Taoiseach in the Dáil. However, the response in the case of Bethany Home is, given the overwhelming evidence, a denial of what happened in the name of the State and a failure to vindicate that handful of people who need to be told they were right. We on this side of the House know they are right. Will this issue be addressed? Will the Government's actions match the noble words often voiced by the Taoiseach? This is the challenge. Will the Magdalen women get their full recompense speedily? Will we acknowledge that there was a conservative counter-revolution that hijacked the promise from ordinary, working class people? It was hijacked by a mean, cruel and conservative political establishment. Will it be acknowledged that all of this was part of a collective abuse of the people and their hopes and ambitions? I recall Professor Diarmaid Ferriter's series, which documented in the most brilliant and obvious fashion the counter-revolution that took place in this State. It was that environment of meanness, cruelty and narrow-mindedness that failed our people. Only when we own up to it can we set free ourselves, those women and those souls.	spk_356
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-06-06	dail	31	Reform of Judicial Appointments Procedures Bill 2013: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_4	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" The Reform of Judicial Appointments Procedures Bill 2013 was published in January last year and it seeks to increase transparency and accountability in judicial appointments. Confidence in the justice system is contingent on a Judiciary which is free from political control and political or other bias. It is essential that there is an independent and impartial Judiciary which is representative of the community it serves. I acknowledge that the overwhelming majority, if not all, of the members of the Judiciary who have served down through the years see themselves in that light. Although I appreciate that, because of the way we have carried out the appointments, it has left the perception of political appointment, which is very unfortunate and must end. A truly representative Judiciary would enhance confidence in the justice system and promote the development of a non-partisan Judiciary and a culture of judicial independence. Future judicial appointments should be drawn from a wide pool of qualified candidates that fully represent the community as a key step towards the eradication of the corrosive and unaccountable system of patronage. We must not allow a ""jobs for the boys and girls"" attitude to permeate something so fundamentally important as the administration of justice in the State. As well as increasing transparency and accountability in the appointment of judges, we also want a judicial council and complaints body that will hold judges to account, along with a code of ethics by which they should abide. This Government should be the last to make political appointments to the Judiciary. We would like to see a sentencing council based on the system in England and Wales, with clear sentencing guidelines given to the Judiciary. I admire the system in place in England and Wales, as it has engagement with the public about what are appropriate sentences for particular categories of criminal offences. On the basis of what is agreed, guidelines are passed to the Judiciary. It is quite a flexible framework and judges still have a degree of discretion according to the circumstances of the individual case, although judges are expected to record the reasons for their decision regarding the sentencing for an offence. I hope the system will be implemented in Ireland. I understand the judicial council Bill is on the way and when the time arises, on behalf of my party I will submit detailed amendments incorporating a sentencing council into the judicial council framework. I have been advised by a number of non-governmental organisations that this is the best way to proceed, although I had intended to submit a sentencing council Private Members' Bill in order to implement the model in Ireland. We want a position where the perception of political appointments to the Judiciary can be brought to an end. We can then clearly state that this is an independent and accountable system, with sentences and practices that are equally accountable. We hope to get that in the next few years through legislation. When we published the Bill last year it was part of Sinn Féin's campaign to end the political cronyism that had been embedded - some would argue it is still there - in Irish society. For too long we have all been aware of stories from across the State of judges being appointed after their loyalty has been demonstrated to Government parties. The days of the old boys and girls club which has dominated the legal and political spheres in Ireland must come to an end. An investigation by Ms Dearbhail McDonald of the  Sinn Fein believes judicial independence is undermined by the current appointment process in this State. The JAAB was established in the wake of the controversial appointment of Harry Whelehan as President of the High Court in 1994 and was meant to remove sole discretion for judicial appointments from Government. However, there is still too much political involvement in the appointment of the Judiciary as the JAAB merely provides a list of seven qualified candidates to the Government, which in turn make the appointments of judicial office holders. Sinn Fein believes that there should be as little political involvement in the appointments process as possible. We have proposed in our Bill to make the following changes to the constitution of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. The chair of the Irish Human Rights Commission shall be the chairperson of the board. Other members will include the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court and the Attorney General. The board would also include a practising barrister who shall be nominated by the chairman for the time being of the Council of the Bar of Ireland; a practising solicitor who shall be nominated by the president for the time being of the Law Society of Ireland; and not more than four persons appointed by the Minister who shall be persons engaged in, or having knowledge or experience that the Minister considers appropriate of commerce, finance, administration or persons who have experience as consumers of the services provided by the courts that the Minister considers appropriate.It is notable that the number of lay representatives on the board is increased from three to four in order to ensure there is meaningful lay representation, in keeping with the equivalent obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. We have also sought to define the criteria for appointments more fully as what we have is somewhat ill-defined and overly subjective. Sinn Féin believes the criteria must be transparently meritocratic. Section 10 of the Sinn Féin Bill also obliges the Government to make public the reasons for appointing an individual to a position within the Judiciary. Key to all our considerations in drafting the Bill were transparency and the restoration of public confidence in the system. We have moved from the model of a short list of seven to one of three.  I recognise the work of the judicial appointments review committee led by the Chief Justice, Ms Susan Denham. This was a very important contribution. At the end of last January she spoke out on behalf of that committee. The judges want a new system of judicial appointment. She called on the Government to de-politicise Ireland’s unsatisfactory, to use her word, judicial appointments process and to introduce new laws to ensure judges are appointed on merit. She also called for the establishment of an independent judicial council to oversee issues such as appointments, pay talks, complaints about judges and judicial education, warning that the absence of such a body is causing great damage. She went on to say political allegiance should have no bearing on appointments to judicial office. The committee's proposals for a remedy to the perception of political appointments are identical to those in my Bill. It calls for a short list of three and for the reasons for an appointment to be given clearly. Everybody in this House agrees that Ms Justice Susan Denham is one of the most respected members of the Judiciary. I accept that there is no question about the independence of the overwhelming majority of judges. Having an allegiance to, being a member of, or adviser to, a political party, should not exclude one from holding judicial office because people should be active in political life and are entitled to pursue political interests in their early life. There needs to be a clear, published meritocracy in the appointment process. There should be no question that any member of the Judiciary is appointed because of his or her political allegiances. That is the challenge we face. The Judiciary wants this to happen, as does the public. If the Government has the will we can achieve that. I lean on the findings of the judicial appointments review committee and the intervention by one of the most respected members of the Judiciary, the Chief Justice Ms Susan Denham. I have submitted this Bill as part of the Government review of this process. The Chief Justice's comments were almost identical to our suggestion. When I and my colleagues in Sinn Féin drafted this Bill we consulted with people who have much more wisdom in these matters to reach a model that struck the right balance. I hope the Government will support the progress of this Bill to Committee Stage where it can amend it, if it has issues with it. If the Government supports the Bill today that would send a clear signal that the Government is ready for change and will engage in that process."	spk_31
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-06-06	dail	31	Reform of Judicial Appointments Procedures Bill 2013: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_4	"I am disappointed that the Government will vote against this Bill but we have had a constructive debate and it has been a helpful opportunity to examine these issues. I reiterate that the intervention by the Chief Justice, Mrs. Susan Denham, and her committee was very timely. It sent a clear message that the Judiciary wants to see a change to the appointments procedure. Whether we like it or not, there is a long-held perception that the men and women of the Judiciary are often appointed on their political allegiances. The first question that many people - in particular those who practise law - ask about a recent judicial appointment is to find out who has been appointed and what are his or her political affiliations. This has been the case and is well known in this House. We need to remove that perception of any political interference in the process. Another point to consider is the importance of the Supreme Court decisions. It is the highest court in the land and its responsibility is to interpret the Constitution on behalf of the people. Its members must often make difficult decisions when interpreting the Constitution. We need to ensure that the Supreme Court is representative of all the Irish people, of all the ideologies in Irish society, including conservative, liberal and reforming ideologies. It is not satisfactory to have an entire Supreme Court based on a conservative tradition, as is the case in some countries. In my view, such a Supreme Court will interpret the Constitution in a conservative fashion. That is the reason these matters are so important; it is a case of achieving a balance in a Judiciary that is representative of all the people in order to achieve balanced, fair decisions. I do not wish to impugn the character of our Judiciary. I accept that we have, in the main, an independent Judiciary which has performed a very proud service to this State. However, I am reassured and supported in my view by the intervention of the Chief Justice, Ms Susan Denham, which shows that the Judiciary believes the process needs to be changed. I believe the Minister of State, like me, as well as Members of this House, wish to achieve that change. I have to accept that the Minister of State does not intend to support the Bill and I accept that the Bill does not provide the full panacea but is instead my humble contribution and I agree that there are many other issues which I have not raised in this Bill. I accept the premise of the arguments made by the Minister of State about the wider range of issues that need to be addressed. I ask that the review process should not be prolonged unnecessarily and that it should be time-limited - I am sure it is - and that the decisions be made quickly. It is in everyone's interest to have a judicial appointments process that is beyond challenge or any suggestion of political interference, even though this may not be the only challenge. We also need to progress the Bill dealing with the judicial council as soon as possible. I suggest the incorporation in that Bill of a model based on the sentencing council in England and Wales which gives clear sentencing guidelines to the Judiciary. We want to achieve an accountable and transparent judicial appointments process with no question about the reasons for the appointment of any individual to the Judiciary - which is a great honour for the individual and his or her family. We need a judicial council to hold the Judiciary to account and puts in place a clear code of ethics and standards. I know the Judiciary would welcome such a regulation. We ask for the establishment of sentencing guidelines to achieve accountability and consistency in judicial decisions. Some decisions have been controversial, in particular those related to sexual offenders being released by the payment of a fine. Such a decision is not in the public interest. In other cases, individuals have received very long sentences for tax evasion. While tax evasion is a serious crime for which an appropriate sentence is required, one must compare the sentences handed down in such cases to those handed down in cases involving sexual attacks, which members of the public regard as much more serious offences. The public must be involved in the process, although not by engaging in some kind of town hall raid, as depicted in ""The Simpsons"" with crowds of people bearing torches descending on a suspect's home. We need to have a mature debate about what types of sentences are appropriate for particular categories of offence. Consistency is required throughout the judicial system if full public confidence is to be retained.  I am pleased to have had this opportunity to propose this Bill and I accept that the Government wishes to address this issue in wider legislation. It should introduce a Bill within the current term to address the two issues I have raised, namely, judicial appointments and a judicial council."	spk_46

As the Minister will be aware, our concerns are that it undermines the Good Friday Agreement. When we from this State would ask those within unionism to support the Good Friday Agreement and implement it in full, particularly the human rights dimensions and to have a Human Rights Act in the North, the fact that we have amalgamated our Human Rights Commission with the Equality Authority does not put us on a very strong platform to lecture them about their responsibilities. This amendment is aimed essentially at respecting the Good Friday Agreement and it is a challenge to the Bill. It lays out our fundamental and most serious concerns about this legislation. Rather than strengthening the State's human rights and equality framework, this is just about saving money. It is about describing or labelling important institutions that protect the human rights and equality of citizens of this State as quangos. We are told they have to be amalgamated because there are too many quangos, but that is deeply unfortunate. A number of years ago, the Equality Authority's budget was slashed by 34%. That led to the resignation of the authority's widely respected chairman. There is a fear and concern that the protection of citizens' human rights has been undermined and that this Bill is unfortunately another step in that direction. Primarily, this amendment is about our concerns over the Good Friday Agreement. The Bill will undermine the Government when it seeks unionism to implement and meet its responsibilities.	spk_231

Senior level posts in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission are never to be filled by secondees from government departments.”.What this amendment seeks to achieve is fairly self-explanatory, and it is to ensure, in as much as is possible, the independence of the new body. It should not be a matter of Department officials being seconded to this new body so we are trying to put a ceiling on the number of people who may be seconded to the new human rights and equality commission, as well as overall human rights institutions. This particularly applies to senior positions.	spk_243

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-05-28	dail	31	Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2014: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_31	"People say a week is a long time in politics and refer to how circumstances can change. I recall when Deputy Wallace introduced this Bill last year, it was resisted and it was seen as wishful thinking, ill thought out and so on. As recently as February this year, I asked the former Minister for Justice and Equality about an independent policing authority and he robustly rejected the notion. All his Government colleagues voted against this Bill last year but it is good to see the conversion on the road to Damascus. An independent policing authority was not included in the programme for Government because it was not considered important enough. As the various scandals emerged, something rotten in the culture among senior managers in the Garda and in the Department of Justice and Equality and the former Minister for Justice and Equality was revealed and, with that, a glaring need for change. I commend Deputy Wallace for tabling the Bill again. The Government says it will support the legislation now subject to amendment on Committee Stage. It is a good Bill, which is well thought out. We disagree on a number of small issues but I commend the Deputy and his team for putting it together. When the Garda Síochána Bill was enacted in 2005, my party colleagues in the House at the time said that it did not go far enough and that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, did not have the powers to carry out its responsibilities. For example, the office did not have the ability to oversee the Garda Commissioner. In recent times, we witnessed the limitations of the powers of GSOC when it could not access the PULSE system directly. In addition, serving members of the Garda worked for GSOC and complaints made to the office were referred to officers to investigate who knew or who had worked with the officers under investigation. This was not acceptable. As I speak, the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Brian Purcell, is appearing before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and he has shown contempt for the committee. He has refused to answer questions about his role in the events that led to the resignation-retirement-sacking of the Garda Commissioner and the issues around the correspondence between the Commissioner and the former Minister and why it took 12 days to bring matters of serious importance, which have led to the automatic granting of a commission of investigation by the Government, to the Minister. The Government initially rejected such a commission in the context of the matters that led to the Guerin report and it also rejected a commission of investigation into allegations that GSOC's offices had been bugged. They are the subject of a review rather than a commission. The Government jumped immediately to establish a commission of investigation into the Garda tapes. When these issues were brought to the attention of the Department, it took 12 days apparently to let the Minister know and we could not get answers as to how that happened during the committee hearing. We also could not find out what happened on that famous Monday night when the Taoiseach, the former Minister for Justice and Equality and their two Secretaries General met. We know the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality was given a job and he met the former Garda Commissioner but we do not know what was said or intimated. We also know the former Commissioner announced that he had retired, resigned or was sacked. Sources close to the former Commissioner say that the following morning he rang the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality seeking an update but he did not get any positive news and then made his announcement. Perhaps I am a little simple but the resignations of a Garda Commissioner and a Minister for Justice and Equality within months of each other are matters of profound public importance, particularly given the circumstances that led to them. The fact that the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality thinks it is acceptable to appear before our committee and to answer no questions about many of these matters and to give a prepared statement that was a rebuttal of the Guerin report, which led to the resignation of his Minister, is evidence that despite all the positive assurances from the new Minister and the Government, things have not changed. Utter contempt was shown to the committee and these Houses. I will seek a response from the Minister to the performance of her Secretary General before the committee. She will be asked again whether she has confidence in her Secretary General but I wonder whether she will express confidence, given she has held back on a number of occasions. What happened earlier is evidence that despite all the assurances, it is business as usual among important and senior people involved in the administration of justice in this State. To suggest that commenting on these matters would prejudice a commission of investigation is utter nonsense. The commission will be led by a retired Supreme Court judge. The  Last Tuesday, my party launched our contribution based on our experiences of all the submissions made in this State and the experiences of our team who negotiated the changes to policing in the North. We do not have all the wisdom and I do not say that the former RUC is comparable to An Garda Síochána but there are lessons in the North in the context of the new beginning there, the policing board, the police ombudsman and the criminal justice inspectorate, which could be a useful contribution to reforms in this State. Our document was circulated to all Oireachtas Members and I invite those who have not had an opportunity to take a look through it. It is our considered contribution but it is not definitive. I would combine many aspects of Deputy Wallace's Bill with it and I even heard submissions earlier today from the former Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Baroness Nuala O'Loan, and the Acting Garda Commissioner in this regard.There are many pieces of wisdom and experience that can be combined. Well done to Deputy Wallace. He has soldiered on this for a long time and it appears that his message has been received. Somebody had a Pauline conversion on the road to Damascus. They realise the Deputy's greatness and his contribution, hard work and determination. I say to him, ""Fair play, and keep her lit""."	spk_393

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-05-15	dail	31	Guerin Report: Statements	dbsect_18	"I congratulate the Minister on her appointment. I will recount all the mistakes made by the Government so all of us can reflect on the lessons that must be learned. As Sinn Féin spokesperson on justice I will give the Minister a fair wind. Although I am happy with the announcements she has made so far in response to some of these crises, I will detail, with the Minister present, what has gone wrong. The Morris tribunal in my home county, Donegal, revealed an appalling abuse of power by the Garda Síochána at every level throughout the county that shocked people throughout the State. It was not isolated and is not unique to Ireland but happens in police forces throughout the world. It was a challenge for us to change the culture and systems that allowed those abuses to happen. It led to the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which established the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Inspectorate and a codified system, and made other welcome changes. However, from the beginning my party said it did not go far enough. We strongly felt the powers of GSOC were insufficient in that the Garda Commissioner was not accountable to it and it could not initiate investigations. We also felt it did not have enough resources and the system of lease out, as it is known, whereby gardaí investigated gardaí was poor practice, and we criticised it repeatedly. We also talked about an independent policing authority. We saw the new beginning in policing in the North. While I am not comparing the old RUC with An Garda Síochána, there are models there from which we could learn and benefit. Some of the findings of the Patten commission were there to be learned from. We, like others, said there needed to be an independent policing authority in the State. From the beginning of the Government's term there was a lack of emphasis on the challenges. For example, the programme for Government did not mention an independent policing authority. When various Opposition Deputies repeatedly called for it, such as Deputy Wallace who brought forward a Bill on it last year, the Government rejected it. In February, I tabled a question to the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, and he robustly rejected the suggestion of an independent policing authority. Up to very recently the Government was not entertaining the idea and was not learning the lessons that were becoming apparent. The decision to amalgamate defence and policing under one Minister was a mistake. It was too much for one Minister to deal with and was disrespectful to the members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces and I welcome the fact that it has ended. The warning signs were there for a long time and were repeatedly ignored.I will comment towards the end of the contribution on what I hope will be a new beginning. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission initiated a public interest investigation a number of years ago into what is known as the Kieran Boylan affair, which involved serious allegations that a major convicted drug dealer had operated as an informer, leading to the alleged entrapment and imprisonment of other drug dealers of lesser threat. He got off with €1.4 million of heroin and cocaine, without any explanation, which was a serious matter. GSOC conducted an investigation and submitted a report to the previous Minister but there has been no response to it. GSOC complained bitterly about the appalling lack of co-operation from the former Garda Commissioner and senior Garda management in that investigation over four years, which delayed the investigation considerably. The seven page summary is in the public domain and it indicated there was a failure to learn the lessons of the Morris tribunal, particularly with regard to the retention of contemporaneous notes. It is a very basic necessity to keep notes and record decisions. The issue of handling informers is a similar issue. These matters were not responded to by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, for months. He stayed schtum and did not say a word about the very severe criticism in the public domain. I chair the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, and it brought in representatives of GSOC, as was its responsibility, to hear its concerns. The episode dragged on for months but it was not isolated. In 2013, Mr. Ian Bailey's legal representatives wrote to the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, on three separate occasions expressing concern about the failure of An Garda Síochána to co-operate with a GSOC investigation initiated on the basis of complaints from them. The Minister of the time did not deal with those issues and he recently responded to correspondence from my party leader, Deputy Adams, by indicating it was not his responsibility. Deputy Shatter eventually stood over a meeting between the former Garda Commissioner and GSOC to agree protocols of co-operation, so it was his responsibility. There was a failure to deal with the systemic failures which were emerging all the time. There is also the issue of the Supreme Court decision not to extradite Mr. Bailey to France, as part of a French investigation, for questioning on the murder of Ms Sophie Toscan du Plantier. The Department of Justice and Equality and the former Minister would have been well aware that this Supreme Court decision was very heavily influenced by the emergence of a 2001 Director of Public Prosecutions report which found no evidence connecting Mr. Bailey to the murder. Moreover, it rubbished the Garda investigation of the time. Unfortunately, it took the former DPP, Mr. Eamonn Barnes, to intervene, after the High Court agreed to extradite Mr. Bailey, by e-mailing his former colleagues with very grave concerns. That forced the Department to hand over the document, which had been in its possession for all those years, to Mr. Bailey's legal team. It is quite clear that is what led to the Supreme Court decision. Despite this and reassurance from the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, that he would enter into dialogue with the Attorney General, nothing has happened since. Nothing has been done to reverse the injustice from all these years. As we assemble here today, the Department of Justice and Equality, on behalf of the State, continues to defend a civil case taken by Mr. Bailey and his partner, Ms Jules Thomas. This is more ongoing evidence of systemic failure and a lack of leadership as the issue drags on. Our party has been critical of the unhealthy relationship between the offices of the Garda Commissioner and the Minister responsible for justice. It is not just about this Government as it affected previous Governments because of the system we have in place. In this Government's term the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, argued that the closure of 140 Garda stations and cuts of over 10% in Garda numbers, which take them below the dangerous threshold of 13,000, as well as decreases in the numbers of Garda vehicles amounted to efficiency, modernisation and smart policing. That was the language used by Mr. Callinan to defend the Government's approach to the outrage of his own members as expressed through the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. On the other hand, the Minister of the day defended the Garda Commissioner from all attacks, as we saw with the penalty points issue. The former Minister for Justice and Equality extended the former Garda Commissioner's term in office as a form of gratitude for the role he played in overseeing cutbacks in the period of transition. We should consider how the former Minister for Justice and Equality on national television used information given to him confidentially by the Garda Commissioner to do down a political opponent, Deputy Mick Wallace. When the inevitable vote of confidence before the House was called, the Government stood full square behind the Minister of the day, despite the fact that the same people had led the charge to remove a Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, when he did exactly the same thing. We all know what happened with the penalty points issue. The former Minister's approach was of circling the wagons around the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda management and attempting to discredit the credibility of the whistleblowers by robustly challenging them on the plinth when the O'Mahony report was published. The Comptroller and Auditor General pretty much vindicated the allegations by former Garda John Wilson and Sergeant Maurice McCabe, and there was an infamous appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts by the former Garda Commissioner when he described the actions of the two whistleblowers as ""disgusting"". We also had a Garda Inspectorate report, and after two years of procrastination, the matters were referred to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. We have also seen what happened to the confidential recipient when a transcript was released of the advice given to Sergeant Maurice McCabe. The confidential recipient was sacked as a result. There were allegations that the GSOC offices were bugged and the Taoiseach was advised clearly by the Department of Justice and Equality to wrongly quote the legislation which put the ombudsman under pressure rather than asking whether the offices were bugged. I hope Mr. Justice Cooke will get to the bottom of that issue. At the end of this debacle we witnessed the resignation of the Garda Commissioner. There have been repeated crises and all this reflects the culture of politics in the Department of Justice and Equality and Garda Síochána, and that must change. I have recited these events to remind us of the challenges we face and of why public confidence has been shattered in the administration of justice. The Guerin report makes for devastating reading for the senior management of An Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice and Equality, with chapter 19 a damning indictment of the practices in the Department. There is an indication of an unhealthy practice of circling the wagons in order that objectives can be fulfilled. There is evidence of indiscipline and incompetence, which is a reflection of the appalling management which must be dealt with. I hope the Garda Inspectorate and this panel of experts will be able to deal with the issue. We will give the process a fair wind but the matter must be dealt with. It is once again a vindication of Sergeant Maurice McCabe. The Opposition will give the Minister a fair wind and she has started with encouraging words. We must see firm actions and a new, independent policing authority. The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality yesterday heard excellent contributions and questions on the issue and I ask the Minister and her officials to look through all the statements. Perhaps they have already done so.We learned a lot and will make recommendations to the Minister. We need a freshly empowered ombudsman and Garda Inspectorate. The Garda Inspectorate is looking for powers of initiation and we will support it in that. The inspectorate, led by three senior personnel, who have outstanding international experience, has a role to play but it needs to be free from the shackles of ministerial control. It needs to be independent and to have powers of initiation to fulfil its important responsibilities.  We need to ensure that lessons are learned from all the mistakes that have happened over the past three years. There must be a fresh start involving a clear-out of people who want to protect the bad old day while reformers who want real change and to vigorously restore confidence in the administration of justice should be promoted. I wish the Minister well in her work. As long as she moves in that direction, she will have my support and that of my party."	spk_228

Only six EU states are not full members of NATO. A recent report stated that ""the NATO Response Force and EU battle groups are complementary, mutually reinforcing initiatives"" and called for efforts to maximise synergies between them. The Minister is aware that Denmark and Malta do not take part in these battle groups. Does he have any plans to adhere to the wishes of the Irish people and not have Ireland involved in these battle groups? That would send a clear signal, and this is aligned to Deputy Daly's question on the issue of Shannon, that we are genuinely a neutral country. That would reinforce the point Deputy Ó Fearghaíl made about conflict resolution. If we were not aligned to NATO forces internationally it would give us credibility in terms of being in a position to deal with conflict resolution."	spk_47

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-04-15	dail	31	Commission of Investigation (Certain Matters relative to An Garda Síochána and other persons) Order 2014: Motion	dbsect_30	It has been a very disturbing period in terms of the whole area of the administration of justice. Public confidence has been fundamentally undermined by the incompetence the Government has shown in overseeing all the episodes that have emerged. The Taoiseach and Tánaiste will be aware that Garda sergeants and inspectors, who are gathering as we speak for their conference, have said that Garda morale is on the floor. They will also be aware that the Minister for Justice and Equality failed to attend the conference. That is bad enough, but there was no replacement. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, could have attended, or an alternative Minister could have attended, as was the case in the past. The Government has basically walked away from hearing first-hand the issues of concern to those Garda sergeants and inspectors. Indeed, the Garda Representative Association has confirmed that, for the second year in a row, it is not even going to bother inviting the Minister for Justice and Equality to its event. Considering the decision he has made in regard to the AGSI, who could blame it? That is the current environment. The platitudes of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste about gardaí, particularly in the speech from the Tánaiste, ring very hollow in terms of how the men and women who are protecting our communities feel right now about how the Government has handled all these affairs. With regard to the administration of justice, the allegations around the Garda ombudsman's office being bugged were very serious. Unfortunately, however, on the day after it was reported in  When it came to the dossier that was handed over to him by the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, which contained the historical legacy allegations from the Garda whistleblower, Sergeant Maurice McCabe, the allegations were again very serious. I remember well the Taoiseach's remarks at the time, but he again opted for a review, not an inquiry, by Mr. Sean Guerin SC. This review is also ongoing. When it came to this matter of the tape recordings, however, the Taoiseach went immediately to a commission of investigation. There are suspicions that there was an attempt at distraction away from what were the core issues. In our party's view, the core issue was another emerging scandal, one of the biggest scandals in the history of the State, which is the whole Ian Bailey affair. To take the House through this, very soon investigating officers from the French authorities will come into our State to look to investigate witnesses. That is outrageous interference in our criminal justice system that the Taoiseach is tolerating, even though he knows the basis of that case and the basis for external investigating officers coming into our jurisdiction is flimsy at best. This is based on Garda files that are now fundamentally flawed, which was proven by the report from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in 2001 of which this State has been aware for all those years. That was the basis on which the Supreme Court refused to extradite Ian Bailey. We have all that information, yet the Government is allowing the French authorities to come here and carry on. It is a fiasco. This involves allegations of Garda behaviour very similar to what emerged during the Morris tribunal, but it is even worse because the State apparatus has stood over this for far too long. Be it the various Ministers with responsibility for the justice portfolio, Attorneys General or the Department of Justice and Equality, they have stood over this whole period. While the incorporation of the Ian Bailey tape recordings from Bandon Garda station into this commission of investigation's terms of reference is welcome, what we need is a dedicated commission of investigation into that whole affair. There are serious questions for the Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of this affair. He has known since early 2012 following the decision of the Supreme Court and that of his own Department to hand over the 44-page critique from the DPP's office of the initial Garda investigation - a critique that apparently rips that entire investigation to shreds. He has known about this for the past number of years and stood back and let it continue. His Department and the Government are defending a civil case taken by Ian Bailey and his partner, Jules Thomas, as we speak. The Government continues to defend that case and to allow the French authorities to come to our jurisdiction on the flimsiest of evidence provided by our own authorities that has been entirely dismantled. Of course, the 44-page critique by the DPP that was given to Ian Bailey's legal team and the Supreme Court and which was the basis upon which the court refused to extradite Mr. Bailey only came into the hands of his legal team because the previous DPP, Eamonn Barnes, realised that there was the basis for a serious miscarriage of justice. He knew from his time in 2001 about this ridiculous and appallingly flawed investigation and all the emerging issues around witnesses being coaxed and cajoled into giving evidence. That was all known about at the highest levels of the administration of justice in this State and it continues.  The Taoiseach must intervene in this case. He needs to bring in the Minister and ask him what he did through 2012. On three occasions in 2012, Ian Bailey's legal team wrote to the Minister about the failure of the Garda to co-operate with the investigation by GSOC. The Minister refused to intervene and to ensure that the documentation that GSOC required was given to it, yet the Minister intervened the following year when GSOC made public its absolute bewilderment and frustration about the failure of the Garda to co-operate in the Kieran Boylan affair so he could have intervened in the Ian Bailey case over those three letters sent to him but he refused to do so. He refused to intervene to sort out the issue of the Garda co-operating fully with GSOC and refused to deal with the implications of the Supreme Court case. He said he would consult the Attorney General and nothing happened. That is the real scandal here.  It then continued into November 2013. The reality is that the Attorney General was briefed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda was very concerned about the tapes that emerged due to the discovery order made against it arising from an application from Ian Bailey's legal team. There were major issues. It took four whole months for the Attorney General to meet the Taoiseach on that fateful Sunday and to brief him about it. So serious was this that the Taoiseach decided immediately to opt for a commission of investigation despite the fact that he opted for reviews in those other serious matters about which I learned earlier. That is the major question mark around the Minister and the way he handled one of the largest emerging scandals in the history of the State. I have no doubt that the full story of this scandal will be told over the next few years and that there will be major question marks for everybody involved.  The Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality debated this issue and welcomed the fact that a commission of investigation would be set up because it would have powers to compel witnesses and documentation and to make findings of fact - powers which are not possessed by the committee. We wanted to see the terms of reference altered in respect of the circumstances that led to the resignation, retirement, sacking or whatever one calls it of the Garda Commissioner; the handling of documentation by the Department of Justice and Equality; the length of time from November 2013 when the Garda Commissioner and the Garda set up a panel to look at this; the knowledge the Attorney General had; how it took that length of time; the circumstances around the decision; and the fateful visit by the Secretary General of the Department, Brian Purcell, who was sent out by the Taoiseach. Since then, sources close to the Commissioner have been briefing one of the leading journalists in this State and making it clear that the Garda Commissioner wanted to withdraw his comments made before the Committee of Public Accounts but that Department officials apparently advised him not to. Another issue is the visit and what was said during it and the reassurance the Commissioner may have wanted on the Tuesday morning. When he did not get it, he knew he had to go. It is very clear to anybody looking at this situation that he was sacked but there are major question marks over what led to that. Sources close to the Attorney General briefed the former editor of  This is why we are very disappointed with the decision of the Government not to amend the initial draft of the terms of reference so as to front-load the political issues. These are the issues around the correspondence with the Department, the sequence of events from November 2013 through to the Taoiseach's meeting with the Attorney General and the retirement or resignation of the Garda Commissioner. Those issues should have been front-loaded and they should have been dealt with as much as possible in public session because the commission of investigation can make findings of fact and compel witnesses and documentation - everything our committee, with the best will in the world, cannot do. We are saying that the Government should have front-loaded those issues, including the Taoiseach's evidence, which can be dealt with very quickly. That should have been done in public and it could have been done within an eight-week period. This is the time the Government has given Mr. Justice Cooke and Mr. Sean Guerin SC to complete their reviews so it is a good template. Eight weeks is plenty of time but the Government has chosen to kick it to touch which fundamentally undermines the overall terms of reference. The Government knows very well that it is unlikely that this work will be completed by the end of this year. It will probably run into next year and possibly the year after that so it could take two years before we hear about what happened and how the Garda Commissioner came to issue his letter of retirement to the Government. That is the big issue at this stage.  There are so many questions. There are major questions for the Minister and questions about why the Government immediately opted for this commission of investigation. A cursory examination of the Dáil records will show that in 1994, the then Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, was dealing with issues around recordings of conversations in Garda stations. She asked the then Garda Commissioner to report to her. Allegations around these practices also emerged in the Morris tribunal. While any suggestion that the privileged conversation between a person who has been arrested or detained and their solicitors is an immensely serious matter, the question is whether there was an attempt to take away from the real core issue. Our party humbly submits that the Ian Bailey affair, the way it has been handled and its implications for this Government constitute the big scandal. This is the one which cannot be denied or walked away from. I hope the Government deals with that and the issue of French investigating officers going back into west Cork to interview people, undermining our criminal justice system and showing disrespect for our processes in this State based on flimsy evidence. Will the Government deal with this issue and intervene? Will it continue to defend the indefensible in terms of the civil case taken by Ian Bailey and his partner, Jules Thomas? Will it continue to stand over all of that? Even at this late stage, will the Government consider the entirely reasonable proposition from the all-party Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality that the resignation of the Garda Commissioner, the handling of correspondence and all the meetings that took place be front-loaded?I urge the Government to front-load the issues of the resignation of the Garda Commissioner, the handling of correspondence and the various meetings that happened. These could be dealt with in the eight week period. Let us get it over with, deal with it and get the full facts out before the public. We can then move on to the issue of the tapes which will undoubtedly take a considerable period of time.	spk_301

It is deeply worrying when one considers the lessons of the Holocaust and the evil that was perpetrated at that time against Jewish people and Gypsies. The Nazis slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Gypsies and Roma during the Holocaust and this is not often given the focus it needs. We need to learn the lessons of that period and I condemn the dangerous morons responsible for some of the incidents against the Minister in recent days. All right-thinking citizens utterly condemn such activity, particularly anti-Semitism. It must be dealt with and hopefully those responsible will be brought to justice.

My party and I are opposed to this legislation and this planned merger, and I am sure the Minister will understand why. The Irish Human Rights Commission was established by the Human Rights Commission Act 2000 and, for those who do not know, the establishment of the commission emanated from the Good Friday Agreement, which set up human rights commissions North and South. The Good Friday Agreement obliges the Irish Government to put in place comparable steps to those in the North to safeguard the rights of citizens. This included the obligation to ""establish a Human Rights Commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within Northern Ireland as stated in the Good Friday Agreement rights and safeguards."" There are two issues arising from this that I will mention briefly. The Irish Human Rights Commission in the South does not have the full range of powers available to the commission in the North, and therefore the equivalence obligation has already been ignored. The fact that the Government in the South is proposing to amalgamate the human rights and equality bodies will result in a mismatch of powers and obligations, and again the equivalence obligations are ignored. The Irish Government should retain the Irish Human Rights Commission as a sole body in the South and invest in it the broad range of powers available in the North. This Bill is unpicking parts of the Good Friday Agreement. The British and Irish Governments are co-equal guarantors of the Agreement and it was also endorsed by the vast majority of people across this island. This Bill undermines the vote of the people and the political, democratic and peace process. The Government's proposal in front of us today undermines the Good Friday Agreement as a whole by sending a message to any party to the Agreement that the possibility exists to hollow it out one component at a time, and we have no doubt there are those who would wish to do so. The potential of the agreements have not been fully realised and elements have not been implemented. This is the view expressed this week by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly. By beginning to unpick aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, this Government will lose the moral authority to challenge those who want to unpick the Agreement or refuse to implement it. We cannot afford to let this happen. It has already been a struggle to get where we are, and we need the Irish Government, as a co-guarantor of this Agreement, to ensure that it is taken seriously, promoting and progressing it rather than removing the parts it does not like. For what has this decision been taken? It has come about because the outcome is a nominal saving in an agency's budget. These savings could be realised elsewhere. This Bill is ill thought out and a counterproductive proposal, and even at this stage I am calling on the Government not to proceed with it. It is bad for human rights and equality in this State. Since September 2011 my party has called on the Government to ensure that the merged bodies continue to benefit from the equivalency of human rights provisions set out in the Good Friday Agreement. This Government must recognise that under the UN Paris Principles, the Irish and Northern human rights commissions hold an ""A"" status rating, meaning that they must be appropriately mandated and financially secure to enable them to conduct their work effectively. The Good Friday Agreement provided for a joint committee of the two commissions to consider the development of a charter of rights for the island of Ireland. Whereas the two commissions completed a draft of the elements to be contained in the charter, there is still much work to be done. It is imperative that the new human rights and equality body is resourced and mandated adequately in order to carry on this work. Sinn Féin, led by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, introduced a Bill to the Dáil to strengthen the Irish Human Rights Commission following the Government's proposal of a merger with the Equality Authority. This Bill would have the effect of increasing the Irish Human Rights Commission's remit and would have given it the protection and status it deserves as a crucial element of the human rights provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. What we see here today is simply a cover for cuts, and both of these organisations are already under-resourced. I am particularly mindful of the resignation of Mr. Niall Crowley, who was chairman of the Equality Authority in 2008 when he was faced with a 32% cut in the authority's budget. It was an unworkable position; he did the right thing and the stand he took at the time was admirable. How could the equality infrastructure and citizens' rights be defended either in that authority or the Irish Human Rights Commission when their ability to do so is being worn away? How could these bodies be a cornerstone of the democratic process and protect citizens' rights while holding the Government to account and ensuring that the State implements and meets obligations to international human rights conventions while resources are being cut time after time? My party and I stand by the Human Rights Commission (Amendment) Bill 2011 as it is better for human rights in this State. At this point I highlight as clearly as I can that the Labour Party was most vocal in its opposition to a proposed merger when Fianna Fáil and the Green Party were in government. At the time, the current Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, accused that Government of ""trying to turn back the clock on the equality agenda"". He deemed such a merger an ""ominous"" proposal. It seems the position is now different for both the Tánaiste and the Labour Party. This evening I urge them to make their feelings known on this issue to their Fine Gael Government partners. How much longer can the Labour Party sit on the Government benches and bow down to Fine Gael? This merger undermines the human rights provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and can only lead to a loss of focus and expertise. If the Government is to live up to its commitments under the Good Friday Agreement - an internationally recognised agreement - then it must ensure these institutions are protected. I call on all Members in this House to oppose the retrograde merger proposals of the Government."	spk_200

The difficulty which arises is that despite the protestations of the management at the hospital and those of the management of the west northwest hospitals group, the parents to whom I refer are of the view that they have lost access to a critically important service provided by the paediatric clinical nurse specialist. Approximately 145 children in Donegal under the age of 18 have type 1 diabetes. The Minister is well aware of what this means for families and of the challenges faced by their children. At a recent public meeting in Donegal, the families involved told their stories and outlined the type of pressure and anxiety with which they are obliged to live. They also indicated how desperately important this resource - which is provided at the hospital - is to them. Under the national diabetes plan, there was to have been one paediatric clinical nurse specialist for every 100 children. One could argue that the number should be 1.5 specialists in place for the children to whom I refer in Donegal. It is clear that there is confusion in respect of this matter. The management of the hospital has written to public representatives in Donegal since the meeting to which I refer took place. Management has not agreed to a further meeting with parents and public representatives in order that matters might be clarified. Is the Minister in a position to intervene in respect of this matter? I am aware that he has agreed to attend a meeting organised by the parents on Tuesday next. I welcome this development but I ask him to resolve the matters to which I refer before that meeting takes place. I request that he make clear to management at the hospital that what is not needed is someone who deals with children on a part-time basis and that what is actually required is a dedicated paediatric clinical nurse specialist who will deal solely with the children in question and their families.	spk_294

I will recap the Ian Bailey case. This State handed over the Garda investigation files to the French authorities. That was deemed to be the thing to do. It was a remarkable decision because An Garda Síochána is not co-operating with requests from the ombudsman's office in the North regarding the killings of Denis Donaldson in Donegal and Councillor Eddie Fullerton, yet it did co-operate with this. That is the Minister's wisdom. It is a remarkable thing to do, and the Minister did it. On foot of that, as the Minister knows, the French authorities have established a magistrate's hearing. Their representatives have been to this State investigating witnesses and they have requested that Ian Bailey be extradited to France. Indeed, our High Court agreed to extradite Ian Bailey to France for prosecution there. However, in November 2011 this State passed over documentation to Ian Bailey's legal team and among that documentation was a damning 44 page report from the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, from 2001 which clearly stipulated that there were no grounds for prosecution of Ian Bailey. That documentation was a game changer. In the subsequent Supreme Court hearing it was decided not to extradite Ian Bailey to France.	spk_458

Let us just recap on all the issues that have led to this, including the Minister's presiding of the Ian Bailey case, which will be a scandal of huge proportions that will damage our international reputation immensely. That is becoming clearer by the day and the Minister needs to clarify his role in that. It is one of the reasons my party has no confidence in him. Let us go through the others, from the handling of the penalty points issue, the procrastination from the moment the whistleblowers went to the Garda confidential recipient, through to the decision to go for an internal Garda investigation, the repeated attempts to discredit the Garda whistleblowers, to the two year delay in referring the decision of the report to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission when it became a crisis before the Committee of Public Accounts, and then to the apology that was dragged out of him last Thursday by his colleague sitting next to him and others. The other issue relates to how the Minister dealt with allegations that the offices of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission were bugged. I do not need to rehearse that again because it is so well known how he has handled that. There was also the sacking of the confidential recipient due to what he said to Sergeant Maurice McCabe about the Minister, his relationship with the Garda Commissioner and the way he does his business. Finally, there was the vote of no confidence from the Opposition in respect of events concerning Deputy Wallace, and the Minister's decision to use confidential information given to him inappropriately by the Garda Commissioner to attempt to discredit political opponents in front of hundreds of thousands of people on television. For all those reasons, we have no confidence in the Minister. We are trying to move to the next steps, which deal with restoring public confidence in the administration of justice, with the establishment of an independent Garda authority, something the Minister refused to examine until it was dragged out of him, and with a freshly empowered Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. After the massive damage done, people in every village, street, town and townland are talking about the need for the Minister to go. Every Minister for Justice and Equality is a reforming Minister. That is part of their job description, but for all those new beginnings to take place, this Minister needs to step aside and let us get on with it.	spk_480

The latest twist in the succession of scandals and crises that have emerged on the Minister's watch occurred yesterday. We were told that the Government had only become aware that a system had been in place in a large number of Garda stations whereby incoming and outgoing telephone calls were illegally recorded. The Government stated it was ""extremely concerned about this information."" Consequently, it decided to do what thus far it has refused to do through all of the other crises - to set up a commission of investigation. Within hours the presented narrative had begun to unravel. We discovered that a Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, report published last June had clearly identified the Garda practice of recording outgoing and incoming calls. In other words, this news was not new. At the time the ombudsman stated the ""Garda Commissioner may wish to re-evaluate his practise regarding the recording of such calls."" The Minister has today alleged that the report was not sent to either his desk or the Department. It is remarkable that, with the array of staff available in the Department of Justice and Equality, not one person was dedicated to monitor reports of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. Is the Minister seriously suggesting nobody in the army of staff available to him has monitored the concerns of GSOC and acted on them, even when there is such a serious recommendation made to the Garda Commissioner? That would be remarkable. Is it credible that the Minister was not told about GSOC's concerns? We know that the Garda Commissioner discussed this issue with the Attorney General in November, the same month in which the practice was stopped. The Attorney General - a Cabinet colleague and member of the Government - knew for almost six months about the illegal recording of conversations. Nevertheless, the Taoiseach has said he was only told on Sunday, while the Minister claims he only heard on Monday evening and received a letter on Tuesday morning. In a further twist it was revealed that the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, had written to the Department of Justice and Equality two weeks ago about the recordings. It is reported that he sent a letter to the Secretary General of the Department and asked that the issue be brought to the Minister's attention. Are we also to believe the Minister was only told about this issue afterwards?The Minister was in Mexico and only learnt about it when he returned."	spk_157

Many more will be outraged that under a succession of Ministers for Justice from Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael, thousands of telephone calls in and out of Garda stations were recorded, inappropriately and illegally in some instances. Did these include detained persons speaking to their solicitors? This is the latest in a series of debacles around An Garda Síochána, the administration of justice and the Minister. Each of these scandals has demonstrated an unhealthily close relationship between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, in which the Minister lost his objectivity and sense of responsibility to the Irish people and his office. Each scandal has highlighted the Minister's inability to address properly the serious issues which have emerged for the justice system and for An Garda Síochána. Instead of new politics and a new way of doing things, as promised by this Government three years ago, we have seen the same old approach. On each occasion, the Minister's first instinct has been to protect the Garda Commissioner rather than get to the bottom of the various allegations without fear or favour. It began with two Garda whistleblowers, John Wilson and Sergeant Maurice McCabe, who raised their concerns regarding the quashing of penalty points by senior gardaí. The Minister responded by attacking the complainants. He attacked Deputy Mick Wallace.	spk_159

He even went onto the plinth to attack the two whistleblowers in a scurrilous effort to undermine their credibility when the O'Mahoney report was published.

The Minister and the Garda Commissioner tried to prevent Sergeant McCabe giving evidence to the PAC. Then there was the scandal of allegations of bugging at the office of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. The Minister's response was to seek to put GSOC in the dock, aided by the Taoiseach, who misrepresented the Garda Síochána Act 2005 by implying that GSOC was the law-breaker. The Minister then summoned the GSOC chairman to his office to ask why he and senior members of the Garda Síochána were not informed about GSOC's suspicions. This action undermined the independence and integrity of that agency. The Minister told the Dáil there was nothing there, nothing to see and to move on. We then, however, discovered that there were sizeable omissions of terminology in his statement to the Dáil about the report of Verimus, the security firm, given to him by GSOC. A written report was sent to the Minister the night before he made his speech to the Dáil on Tuesday, 11 February. On the following Tuesday, 18 February, the Minister presented a peer review from an Irish security company, Rits, in which he said not only was there no definitive evidence of surveillance or bugging but no evidence whatsoever, and that there would be a rebuttal. We await evidence of that. An Oireachtas committee will seek it in due course.  Instead of establishing a commission of investigation, the Government appointed retired judge, John Cooke, to carry out a review with terms of reference set by the Minister. It falls far short of what is required to get to the bottom of that issue. The Government presented the latest revelation as if it knew nothing until this weekend about it. This ignores the fact that the Government, through the Department of Justice and Equality, knew of these illegal recordings as early as last June, and that the Attorney General, the Minister's Cabinet colleague, knew of them also, at the very latest, by November. The Government did know but the Taoiseach was not told until Sunday. The Minister claims he knew nothing of this until Monday and Tuesday. By his actions, through his dysfunctional relationship with the Garda Commissioner, and by his failure to deal properly and effectively with a series of highly charged and important issues, the Minister has undermined public confidence in the position of Minister for Justice and Equality, in the Department of Justice and Equality, in An Garda Síochána and in the administration of justice. The appointment of a commission of investigation on this issue will not assuage public concern, given the level of public distrust that now exists.

I note that the independent policing authority was not included in the programme for Government. Hence the importance some parties attribute to that decision. There is an opportunity for a step change, a new beginning, in policing, policing structures and the administration of justice in this State, an opportunity to get politicians out of policing matters. It will be a lost opportunity if this process is not taken on. To be successful, a new beginning for policing in this State needs a new Minister for Justice and Equality. The Taoiseach has said he will not ask you to resign. That is a mistake. Perhaps the Minister could on this occasion take the right decision and, like his friend Martin Callinan, resign. There is widespread public support for An Garda Síochána. The service has a unique, deep-rooted connection to communities, which the Government is actively dismantling through its policy of closing 140 Garda stations, cutting the number of Garda vehicles and reducing the number of gardaí by 10%. There is, however, a culture of bad administration, a lack of accountable and oversight mechanisms and transparency. This culture, which smacks of cronyism, elitism and the corrosive, corruptive relationship with the elites, which the Government pledged to root out, is now evident in other institutions of the State. It is a culture among senior management that betrays the sacrifice and integrity of rank and file gardaí. There are over 13,000 members of An Garda Síochána across the State, men and women, the overwhelming majority of whom have done no wrong. They have been profoundly failed by a cabal of senior management and the Minister. The message should go out clearly today that the vast majority of members of the Garda Síochána continue to have the unwavering support of the Irish people but the Minister does not, and neither did the outgoing Commissioner.  This culture was evident in the failure to investigate properly the Fr. Molloy case or the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. It stems, to a large degree, from the fact that for many years political leaders allowed the legal, judicial and policing system in this State become an adjunct of British counter-insurgency in the North of Ireland. This resulted in special non-jury courts-----	spk_166

It was also evident in the Kerry babies case; in the behaviour of some gardaí in Donegal that was exposed by the Morris tribunal; in the oppressive regime imposed on communities in Rossport, in the Taoiseach's own constituency; and in the Kieran Boylan affair where senior gardaí protected a drug smuggler. It was evident in the failure to investigate properly murders such as that of my colleague in Donegal, Councillor Eddie Fullerton, in 1991. There is now an opportunity to change all of this. That means creating an independent, accountable and transparent Garda Authority. Sinn Féin welcomes the Government's belated conversion to the necessary reform but it is worth noting that neither Fine Gael nor Labour put it in the programme for Government. If the Government has come to that position now and if we see fundamental change the Irish people will at least have some sense of reassurance out of the mess of recent years. No police service, no senior police officer and no Garda Commissioner should be solely accountable to a politician, no matter who that is. The Garda Commissioner should be fully accountable to an independent policing board, to the Oireachtas and to local joint policing committees, which should be much stronger than they are now. Policing in this State has been too long locked into structures that obstruct the building of a modern, 21st century, accountable policing service. I ask the Minister to play his part in building it by stepping aside. The Garda confidential recipient and the Garda Commissioner have walked the plank, now it is time for the Minister to walk the plank to restore public confidence in the administration of justice so that we can collectively rebuild a modern police service for the 21st century."	spk_168

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-03-26	dail	31	Garda Inspectorate Report on the Fixed Charge Processing System: Statements	dbsect_26	"Let us together walk the path that the whistleblowers have walked over the past two years. We will start off with the coming together of the two men. Can the Minister imagine they probably met while they were on duty, or in whatever circumstances, and got talking about some of the issues that they had come across? They, maybe, found strength in each other to raise them and then took their concerns to the former Garda confidential recipient, Mr. Oliver Connolly. After months and months of getting nowhere - I will deal with the sacking of Mr. Connolly later on and some of the detail of the conversations that he had with the Garda whistleblowers, and I note that Deputy McGuinness has revealed some more details today about other conversations and a culture that existed - instead of being supported they were being advised that they would be better to stay schtum because they would not want to get in the way of the Minister and the Garda Commissioner and their close relationship. That is what is in the transcript. Rather than the Garda confidential recipient feeling empowered that he, as a mediator, would have the ability to bring these issues to the Minister for Justice and Equality and they would be pursued without fear or favour, he found himself advising them otherwise. It is disturbing to read through that transcript. That was the stonewalling that took place for those months. After that, obviously, they got together and said that the seriousness of that which they were unravelling and on which they were building evidence was something that they could not merely let stay within this stonewall internal shut-down system. They then took their concerns to the Comptroller and Auditor General and sent detailed evidence of their allegations. They also sent them to the Road Safety Authority, and to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. There was much concern, and many conversations taking place between those bodies, and it was established and agreed that this was serious material that needed to taken seriously and addressed properly. Still not really seeing progress, they then availed of their right under the law, under section 62 of the Garda Síochána Act, to take their issue to a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, in this case, Deputy Clare Daly. Deputy Clare Daly and other colleagues then did their job and came into this House and raised the urgency of this matter. Then, in and around that time, finally, rather than an independent examination immediately of all of these serious matters with a considerable bulk of evidence to back them up in terms of documentation, the choice was to go for an in-house investigation. That in-house investigation, carried out by the assistant commissioner, Mr. O'Mahoney, never availed of the opportunity to speak to the whistleblowers who made the allegations. The Minister should think about the following. Imagine I ring my local Garda station to state my house has been robbed and I am really worried. I ask if somebody can be sent out and the garda comes out onto my street and knocks on every door on my street except my house, the house that was robbed and reported the alleged crime. That is what happened here and the Minister stood over that. The report was issued in 2013 and the Minister went out on the plinth and castigated with glee the two Garda whistleblowers stating that the vast bulk of what they had stated was reckless, disproved and all over the place. He held that line vigorously under challenge after challenge in this Chamber from the Opposition. That is what he did. However, it all fell to pieces when the Comptroller and Auditor General made his report. The key findings of that report included one in five persons who were facing road traffic offences were getting off; a half of all road-traffic related summons were not being issued; and, in some Garda districts the level of termination of penalty points was 50 times higher than others. It was a damning report. After that, I came in here, along with other members of the Opposition, and stated that the two Garda whistleblowers had been vindicated and asked the Minister if he would find it within himself to acknowledge that and carry out an independent inquiry into these matters as soon as possible. There was no doubt about it then. It was big, it needed to be looked at. There was massive dysfunction in the management of the system which should ensure we do not have one rule for one motorist and another rule for another, and we needed to change all of that. The Minister refused to address it point blank. It then dragged on. The Committee of Public Accounts did its job and brought forward the relevant officials until, eventually, the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, came before them. He talked about ""so-called whistleblowers"", and then, of course, he went on to use that now notorious phrase, ""disgusting"". The Minister knows the message that sent out to any person, man or woman, working in the public or private sectors, that if one speaks out, puts ones career on the line and isolates one's family in one's workplace, that is the level of support one can expect. The Minister never spoke out about those comments. Of course, he himself had misled the House by stating that the whistleblowers failed to co-operate - talk about turning words around to suit whatever agenda was there. That was the period of two years on the path those two whistleblowers walked. I had a chance to speak to them, as had many other members of the Opposition, on numerous occasions.They and their families were very isolated and briefly wondered, at times, if they had done the right thing. It is a difficult and lonely place to be. There was very little support but, over time, more journalists, Opposition Members and some Government Members became interested. Finally, when it came to crisis point with what the Garda Commissioner said before the Committee of Public Accounts and the major outcry, the Minister decided to refer it to GSOC for a vigorous, independent examination of the matters at hand. That is the journey, that is what happened. Now we move on to the apology. It is good that both men are entirely vindicated. They and their families can have some sense of solace that the Minister has finally done this. However, none of the public and no one watching these proceedings believes the Minister has come to this of his own volition. This is to save the Minister's hide. It is too little, too late and this is about saving his political hide. It was impossible not to come in and issue the apology; otherwise, the Minister was gone. Even though the Minister has finally done the right thing and given an apology to the men, he should go. He should resign from his position because of other issues. Let us walk through the allegations that GSOC offices were bugged. On Monday, the day after the report in  One would think the Minister would step back after doing so but the following Tuesday he came into the House with a peer review from an Irish security company, Rits. He gleefully talked about the fact that there was nothing to see here unless the customers of the Insomnia coffee shop were spying on GSOC. This was a condescending remark. The Minister said that not only was there no definitive evidence but no evidence whatsoever and nothing to see here. This was a strong rebuttal. That report was remarkably similar to that of the journalist Paul Williams in the  The next issue concerns the sacking of the confidential recipient, Oliver Connolly. The behaviour of the Minister has been remarkable in his refusal to entertain any criticism of Garda Síochána senior management. By doing so, he has utterly failed the vast majority of the members of the Garda Síochána and led the organisation into disrepute. He has led them into crisis after crisis and the man or woman on the frontline now has a more difficult job to do. That is why the Minister must go. The culture in the Garda Síochána senior management was a closed culture and involved shutting down the ability of the outside world to criticise its management and mechanisms. That is all now in shreds. That leads to my final comments. The Minister is now an adherent of an independent police authority. Is it not wonderful to see the Pauline conversion on the road to Damascus? I raised this matter in a priority question to the Minister. I asked him if he would go for an independent policing authority and the Minister robustly rejected it, talking about all the reasons why not. The Minister has come around but everything he has come round to has involved kicking and screaming. Let us go back over what the Minister has come round to. He has come around to an independent policing authority, more powers and a properly resourced and strengthened GSOC. Although Sinn Féin is not happy with it, believing it should be an independent commission of investigation, the Minister has come around to the idea of an independent review of the allegations that GSOC offices could be bugged. The Minister resisted but came around to it under pressure. The Minister resisted the documentation handed over by the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Martin, to the Taoiseach. It is now subject to an independent review. We are not happy with that and believe it should be a commission of investigation but it is an independent review, which the Minister resisted. Now, the Minister resisted an apology but here he is to save his hide. It is too little, too late. It is great that it happened but it should have come from the Taoiseach and he should have sacked the Minister and delivered this apology. The Labour Party will seek political cover tonight but in every town, village, street and townland, regardless of people's political affiliation, they think the Minister should go. We must then set about the vital work of restoring public confidence in the administration of justice and to put in place a modern policing organisation that is fully accountable and transparent for the century we live in."	spk_589

My party and I welcome the spirit of this Bill and will be supporting its progress to Committee Stage. However should the Bill get to that Stage, Sinn Féin will seek to amend it in order to strengthen it further. I will speak further about this a little later in my contribution. Restorative justice is an approach to responding to criminal and other harmful behaviour that enables the perpetrator of a criminal or other harmful act to offer restitution or reparation to the victim or the victim’s community or both. It identifies crime or anti-social behaviour as an act against an individual or community rather than against the State.Sinn Féin sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system across the island because we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice as it results in higher victim satisfaction, a lower incidence of repeat offending and a greater chance of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. In the meantime, we are committed to expanding and improving the use of restorative justice, including community restorative justice and community mediation programmes, both within and alongside the existing justice systems North and South. Although we may agree loosely with the idea that those who commit offences of theft should pay back the costs of the goods they have stolen, the manner in which this Bill suggests that the money should be recouped is not something we could definitively support. Section 19 deals with attachment of earnings orders where an offender has failed to pay the sum of money in full by the set dates. Section 19(c) allows a court to make an attachment of earnings order to a person in receipt of a social welfare payment. This automatically raises questions. As Members know, social welfare payments are often calculated in regard to households. I and my party would worry that where an attachment order is made in respect of an offender, there is a chance that the partner or child of the offender will suffer unfairly due to the behaviour of his or her partner or parent. This is one area we would seek to amend should this Bill reach the next Stage. Of course, we will work constructively with the Deputy on that. There is also the worry that if one cuts far enough into someone’s salary or social welfare payment, one could leave him or her in a situation in which he or she could not survive financially, and this is another area of concern to us. In order for this Bill to be fair, we would need to work to ensure that strict conditions are placed on attachment orders. We must also be mindful of the danger of placing an attachment order on someone who is already struggling to be an upstanding citizen and the possibility that, rather than being restorative, this could actually have the opposite effect, causing someone to become more detached from society. If both parties agree to such a mechanism then it is fair to call it restorative justice, but attaching an order for payment to someone's salary or social welfare payment who does not want to pay is certainly not what we would know as restorative justice. In the North of Ireland restorative justice practices have come on in leaps and bounds, but here in the Twenty-six Counties we have much more to do. Although there some good examples across this State, we have much more work to do. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at this very issue. Although restorative justice can be very labour-intensive, it is nowhere near as costly as incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. It is time we started to give real consideration to alternative strategies in this State.  I reiterate my initial point that we support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. Should it get there, we will work closely with the Deputy to strengthen it and to take into account some of the concerns I have outlined in my contribution.	spk_587

The Labour Party had its annual conference a number of weeks ago and Fine Gael had its Ard-Fheis last weekend at which the Minister for Justice and Equality received a standing ovation which was completely out of keeping with the public mindset. That is Fine Gael's internal business but to bring it into this House is ridiculous. Unfortunately, we must engage with it and give our response.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-03-05	dail	31	Government's Priorities for the Year Ahead: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_25	"That is the respect he has for this House. It was a load of bloody nonsense. If Ministers can schedule three days to make congratulatory speeches, they can listen to the responses from the Opposition following their nonsense speeches. There are three Ministers in the Department of Justice and Equality, but not one of them is here to engage with us. It is an absolute farce. However, I will use my eight minutes to rebut the rubbish we heard yet again from the Minister for Justice and Equality today. Let us talk about immigration. I could not believe he mentioned immigration when we have the shameful direct provision centres in the State in which people from various cultures throughout the world are locked up for years, as if they were convicts, because of our archaic asylum system and must also eat food which is not applicable to their cultures. The Minister had the audacity to even mention it in his self-congratulatory speech. There was also the issue of judicial appointments.It has reached the stage at which the judges themselves, through the Judicial Appointments Review Committee, led by the Chief Justice, Ms Susan Denham, have said the political appointments system has to end. That committee has recommended that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board draw up a short list of three candidates, with the Government choosing a judge and publishing the reasons for its choice. That is in keeping with various Bills prepared by Deputies Niall Collins and Shane Ross and me. A range of Opposition Deputies have tried to have this issue addressed but the Minister has kicked it to touch again with another review. This is nonsense and I cannot believe he had the audacity to include it in his speech.  The Minister also referred to the Legal Services Regulation Bill. What a brass neck he has. That Bill has dragged on for three years and the main agenda of the Minister is to bring in multidisciplinary practices or one-stop shops for big business. Such practices are excluded in almost every other European country and are clearly not seen as the way to go, but our Minister wants to bring them in here. Whose agenda is being served here? The main issue of concern to Joe and Josephine Public is the cost when one tries to get justice in the State. When one goes to a solicitor and tries to get justice, it costs one a fortune. Even family law cases and civil court cases cost a fortune. Is that issue, the most important one, being dealt with in the Bill? Absolutely not. The Bill has been dragging on for three years and the whole thing is a nonsense. Deputy Niall Collins was spot on in what he said earlier. We often give the Minister credit for being a hard worker and for bringing forward progressive and reforming legislation, but that is what a Minister for Justice and Equality does. The Minister is in charge of the law and the law has to change. Things happen, issues are on the agenda for many years and whoever is the Minister for Justice and Equality can rightly claim to be reforming because that is his or her bloody job. The Minister has introduced some legislation with which we agree and that is fair enough. However, there is a list of really important issues that he has not addressed, including white-collar crime. People are rightly furious that those who presided over the disaster that saw our State bankrupted - namely, big bankers, greedy developers and many others who screwed the State and the people - have not been brought to account. Where is the legislation to deal with that? Where is the promised legislation that would deal with that issue effectively and would send a clear message to the public that white collar crime will be punished? The Minister has no problem locking people up for not paying their bills, putting people behind bars for not paying for their television licences or incarcerating people who come from the wrong side of the street, who have never had a chance in life. When it comes to the big knobs, however, the ones with whom the Minister wines and dines, who flatter him and who have backed him up over the years, it seems that they cannot be brought to justice. These are the things that matter to people. These are the things I would like to have seen in the speech from the Minister rather than listening to something more suited to the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis. The next issue is equality and social protection. This blows me away. The programme for Government states the following: ""This Government is committed to tackling Ireland's economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced, and which recognises the need for social solidarity"". While that sounds lovely, it is clearly not the case. Last year my party and others introduced the Equal Status (Amendment) Bill which sought to amend the existing legislation to provide for equality-proofing of Government policies and budgets and of public bodies through equality impact assessments. Had that Bill been accepted and passed, it would have ensured Governments and public bodies exercised their functions in a way that was designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome that result from socioeconomic disadvantage. This Government came into office on a wave of promises in 2011, but soon afterwards it became apparent that many of its plans involved taking from some of the most vulnerable. The Government rejected the Equal Status (Amendment) Bill even though it was Labour Party policy, agreed by its own members. The Bill was rejected, and two nights in a row the Government sent in Ministers from the Labour Party - not from Fine Gael - to rebut legislation that would have taken away the reliance on election promises, as famously referred to by Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and actually made sure budgets were drawn up on the basis of equality impact assessments. The Government did not want to know when it came to the crunch. The vindication of victims' rights was another aspiration of the 2011 document, but we learned today during the Order of Business that there is no date for that legislation; it is not going to happen. We arrive now at the most profound failure - policing. If one listens to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and to his pal the Garda Commissioner, one hears terms such as ""modernisation"" and claims that we have had tremendous success in combating crime. Everything is hunky-dory now because we have modernisation. We have ""smart"" policing now, where we had stupid policing in the past. It is ""smart"" today; we are really smart. How did the Minister do this? He cut Garda numbers by 10% across the State, he closed 140 Garda stations, he did not replace Garda vehicles and he amalgamated rural Garda districts. If one asks any garda, whether at the front gate of Leinster House or in one's constituency, in a supermarket or at a football match, what is his or her view of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner - who has sadly become his mouthpiece in defending the cutbacks - one finds a sheer lack of confidence in them and often one finds anger. Gardaí are angry that the Minister and the Commissioner are incapable of doing the job they have been asked to do. We have a situation whereby every time Opposition Members speak about An Garda Síochána, they are accused of being anti-Garda. Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly, in particular, get that all the time. It is claimed that they are against the Garda and hate them, which is nonsense. Everything they have proposed, with proposals from me and Deputy Niall Collins, would actually strengthen the Garda, boost morale and restore public confidence.  We have seen various debacles recently, including the controversy surrounding the Garda confidential recipient, allegations that the offices of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission were bugged, the penalty points fiasco and the profound issue of the treatment of Garda whistleblowers. All of these matters have hugely undermined public confidence in the administration of justice. Deputy Alan Shatter's presiding over all of that has been a disaster. The Minister should have resigned by now, or he should have been kicked out by the Labour Party, but for whatever reason, the party does not want to do that. We had to sit and listen to the Minister treating us with utter contempt last week, refusing to answer question after question. He delivered his self-congratulatory Fine Gael Ard-Fheis speech here today and then scooted off out the door so that he would not have to listen to the rebuttals. The Minister may think it is okay to walk out of this Chamber today and to treat us with contempt, but it is not going to work. We are not going to go away. We are going to continue to try to make An Garda Síochána a stronger organisation, to provide for stronger oversight and to restore full public confidence in the crucial organs of our democracy and the administration of justice. We will keep doing our job and keep challenging the Minister. As long as he is in his role, he must face the reality that we will not hide away or back down. We are going to do our job to the best of our ability."	spk_366

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-02-27	dail	31	Commissions of Investigation	dbsect_3	The issues in regard to the alleged bugging of the GSOC offices are very clear. They have been gone through line by line and every decent journalist in the State has reported on and analysed them. The Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions has spent hours dealing with the issues. The allegations and the issues of concern are very clear. Why did the Minister not deploy the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 and give a person or persons the ability to compel witnesses, compel all the relevant documentation and make findings of fact? Why was that not agreed to? What is the reason for the delay in doing that?

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-02-26	dail	31	Allegations in relation to An Garda Síochána: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_11	"There is a predictable pattern to these statements. Obviously, the Opposition will express criticism and deal with our concerns and the Government Ministers and backbenchers will speak to the virtues of the Minister and so on. I will get that out of the way first. The Minister has been extremely hard working and has brought through a large amount of legislation. In the main, he is progressive and it is a pity about this entire debacle bearing in mind the programme of work he has done and wishes to do in the future. That is not the point. That is agreed. Nobody denies that the Minister is hard working or that much of the legislation he has introduced is admirable and needed to happen. That is not the point. The second issue relates to An Garda Síochána, which has more than 13,000 members. Deputy Charles Flanagan is right in pointing out that we have a police service and I am glad he made the distinction from a police force. We all need to start using the term ""police service"" in future. Our police service is unique in that it is so close to our communities. There is no one in this House who has not played football or had conversations when we have left our children to school with a member of An Garda Síochána. Many of us have served on local community committees with them. It is a very admirable service. The vast majority of the men and women of An Garda Síochána are honourable, decent and hard-working people who have done no wrong. All of these controversies are a let-down to them because a garda pulling over a motorist today to give penalty points is the one taking the flak for all this. A garda investigating matters and trying to do his or her job is the person taking the flak on the front line. The people who have been failed most are the members of An Garda Síochána and some of the families caught up in these various controversies. Also impacted, sadly, is the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. The people to have failed the members of An Garda Síochána most are their senior management. That senior management has made the errors and not dealt properly with the matters coming before it. That is indisputable. I also believe the Minister has not handled these matters as he should have. I listened to the Minister's speech today. He is entitled to give a defence of himself as he did on a range of matters. He is also entitled to raise the previous Administration's handling of these matters. However, I was alarmed about two issues. First, he did not even deal with the issue of the sacking of the confidential recipient and the transcript of the comments made that have given rise to major questions in the public domain. The sacking of the confidential recipient was a major development and it is remarkable that the Minister found it unnecessary to touch on it in his 30-minute speech. The second area about which I was alarmed was the Minister's return to the issue of Sergeant Maurice McCabe not co-operating and his inability to deal finally with that issue. It is very clear that the assistant commissioner, John O'Mahony, did not make any effort to go to the person in question. Can we imagine if gardaí were investigating any alleged crime and they did not go to see the witness, the person who made the report? Can the Minister imagine any scenario where a member of An Garda Síochána investigating a very simple crime or allegation would not go to the person who made it? The assistant commissioner, John O'Mahony, has confirmed that he did not knock on the door of Sergeant Maurice McCabe. He did not text, ring, call, e-mail or make any attempt to go to the people who made the allegations. If, as the Garda Commissioner apparently suggested, he gave an order to Sergeant Maurice McCabe to co-operate, why was Sergeant Maurice McCabe not disciplined? When the Minister famously went out on the plinth after the publication of the O'Mahony report back in May 2013, he strongly criticised the whistleblowers that day but why did he not refer to the fact that they did not co-operate if that was the issue for him? Why did the assistant commissioner, John O'Mahony, go to the station in which Sergeant McCabe serves and interview personnel but not see fit to talk to Sergeant McCabe? It is clear and patently obvious that they did not want to talk to Sergeant McCabe. When An Garda Síochána was dealing with the cold case review of the Fr. Niall Molloy case, the journalist, Gemma O'Doherty, whose immense work almost definitely led to that review, was not questioned by the team doing that cold case review. We have a culture where people who have made allegations, done the work and put their concerns about important matters of public interest in the public domain, or by whatever channel is necessary, are not even interviewed. It is indefensible. It is nonsense. The Minister should have apologised today on the record. I wish to ask the Minister, who is engaged in a conversation, a question. Has he had a chance to review the transcript issued by Sergeant Maurice McCabe - a statement read out by the Commissioner - around the visit by a Garda chief superintendent on behalf of the Garda Commissioner? I will ask him this question later on, as I appreciate he cannot answer it now, but I ask him to think about it and I will revisit it later. Anyone who would read that chief superintendent's transcript of a conversation would see that it was an order to Sergeant Maurice McCabe to stay silent, not to use PULSE, not to co-operate with third parties and that there was no order for him to go out and immediately co-operate with the investigation. It is incredible that the people who were dealing with the allegations, who made them and who had gone through the process were not interviewed about all that. I cannot understand how the Minister cannot see that but there we are. In terms of the three episodes that are in the public domain, one is the issue of the penalty points debacle. To recap on this briefly, two Garda whistleblowers went to the confidential recipient, felt they were apparently being stonewalled after months of inaction and then took their concerns to the Road Safety Authority, the Comptroller and Auditor General, Government Departments and to a Dáil Deputy, as is their right under the law. The Minister then settled for an internal Garda investigation. The report of the internal Garda investigation, published in May 2013 after a period of six months, is now seen to have minimised the scale of what was being reported. Months later, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report pretty much vindicates the concern about the scale of the problem. That was the core complaint from the Garda whistleblowers - the scale of what was happening, the amount of loss revenue and the other issues related to road safety. The matter found its way into the Committee of Public Accounts. The Commissioner infamously came before it and made comments that he thought the behaviour of these whistleblowers was disgusting. Then it turns into a crisis and after almost two years and after all of that, the Minister finally refers it to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, an independent arena. That was badly handled. The Minister must see that was badly handled throughout. The second issue is that of the confidential recipient, the sacking of Oliver Connolly. With regard to the transcript, why would he say what he said? Where did he get that from? Apparently, he is an honourable man. The Minister said so himself when he appointed him. He is a respected solicitor. His character is not in question. Why would somebody like that say what he said? That must be answered. The third issue is the alleged bugging of the offices of GSOC, how that was handled and how GSOC was put in the dock rather than given the support of the Minister's office. What the Minister demonstrated in his handling of all three issues, because of his unhealthily close relationship with the Garda Commissioner, is that his instinct was to circle the wagons and not to get to the truth of the allegations and, in some cases, to discredit those who were making the allegations or to undermine them. The Minister has handled all three issues badly in the way he has dealt with them and the way the Garda Commissioner has dealt with them. That is why the more than 13,000 members of the Garda Síochána are under pressure, and this has impacted on their morale which has been impacted on already by cutbacks and everything else they have faced in recent years. Why did the Minister not avail of the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004? There is probably no Member of this House more expert on,  There is a lot of thinking for the Minister to do. I hope these episodes will be learned from and that more powers will be given to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. There needs to be, and we have engaged in discussion on this, an independent policing authority in this State, similar to the arrangement in the north of Ireland, that is accountable to the Oireachtas, accountable to an independent policing authority representative and accountable to joint policing committees. That is where we need to get to. We need to see serious change to learn lessons from all that has happened and then the Minister can get on with the other work, on which I have commended him."	spk_242

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-02-26	dail	31	Post Office Network: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_26	I am here as a representative of the people of Donegal just as all of us represent our communities. I will report on the post office situation in Donegal. In Greencastle, at the very top of the Inishowen peninsula, the postmaster, Cyril Gormley, sadly passed away. Very soon afterwards, An Post questioned the future of the postal service that his son wanted to continue. It was very insensitive at the time and the community was very aggrieved. A public meeting was held in Greencastle which was attended by a large turnout. The community made the case for the post office and it has been awarded a one-year reprieve. This is not good enough. They have no certainty about the future of their vital post office. In Carrigart a packed public meeting showed how much their post office means to the community. They sent a signal to all of us that we need to protect these vital rural services. I attended a public meeting in Gleneely in north Inishowen. The postmaster is retiring and the community does not know where it stands. The people are looking to see whether they can pull together and they will be forced to make a business case for what is a public service that should be fundamental for any rural community. This is not acceptable. Bunbeg in west Donegal has had a post office since the late 1800s. The postmistress is retiring and An Post has received a large number of submissions requesting the retention of the post office, but the community does not know what will happen. If the post office closes in Bunbeg, it will be the fourth post office closure in that parish in the past ten years. When the AIB branch closed in that parish the people were told by the Government of the time not to worry because the banking services would be provided by the post office. These are just a few examples of which there are many more from my county alone of how much the postal network means. The Minister has said that the social welfare contract is retained and there is no concern at this time. The postmasters and postmistresses and the communities supporting them want to know what is the Minister's plan for the future sustainability of our post office network. How can we be sure that we will not have to compete with supermarkets in big towns? How can rural communities compete because Tesco or SuperValu will not come to small rural towns? Will people have to go to regional bases? I want the Minister to tell the House about his plan for the long-term sustainability of our post office network, of our rural communities who are clinging to the last vestiges of their services. That is my report from Donegal and I am sure other Deputies will give him reports from their counties. I hope that at the conclusion of this debate, the Minister will give a cast-iron guarantee that he will implement a plan for the sustainability of our post office networks, a retention of the social welfare contract and search for other business opportunities such as banking which the post office network can offer.	spk_551

As the Minister of State is aware, my party supports the objective of this long-overdue Bill. One must ensure, in so far as possible, that people are not being sent to prison for non-payment of fines. However, one must also try to ensure the fines are actually collected in a realistic fashion. Sinn Féin considers that people who will come before the courts for non-payment of fines should be given a period of 24 months. In this respect, Sinn Féin is supported by other groups such as the Free Legal Advice Centres, as well as non-governmental organisations that work in this area. I ask the Government to consider extending the timeframe for the payment of a fine in these instalments from 12 to 24 months. As for amendment No. 2, an administrative charge comprising 10% of the fine is proposed in the Bill. My point is that a maximum value should be placed on that charge. The amendment proposes that the administrative charge should not be in excess of €50. It should be €50 regardless, in that even if the fine is higher than €500, €50 should be the maximum amount for the administrative charge. Amendment No. 3 pertains to the amount that cannot be subject to instalments. The Government has provided that any amount less than €100 must be paid up-front and cannot be subject to instalments. This amendment proposes the reduction of that threshold to €50. Again, the objective of all these amendments is to make the legislation work and to ensure that the maximum number of people possible actually pay the fine and are not obliged to go to jail or engage in community service unnecessarily.	spk_68

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-02-11	dail	31	Reports of Unlawful Surveillance of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission: Statements	dbsect_26	"The report in  The GSOC has a responsibility to report to this Oireachtas and does so, as the Minister knows, through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions. The GSOC was established under the 2005 Act and followed the Morris tribunal in my home county of Donegal. This tribunal revealed gross abuses of power by some gardaí, from the rank and file up to senior level. It demonstrated the need for change in areas like the handling of informers and false arms finds. Another issue was the terrible ordeal of the McBrearty family. This is the context in which the Garda Síochána Act, the GSOC and the Garda Síochána Inspectorate were introduced. From the outset our party argued very strongly that the GSOC did not have the requisite powers to do its job. For example, it does not have oversight of the Garda Commissioner, as is the case with the ombudsman and the chief constable in Northern Ireland. The GSOC did not have access to the PULSE system to get directly to issues without somebody looking over its shoulder. Another issued related to the confidential recipient. Gardaí did not have the ability to report matters of major concern directly to the GSOC.  In case there is any doubt the GSOC did not have the requisite powers, we can see the issue in its own publication. Last year, the GSOC completed its public interest investigation into the handling of informers by An Garda Síochána and our intelligence services. It was a painstaking investigation that took years to complete although it did not need to take so long. In this report, the GSOC revealed the appalling lack of co-operation from senior Garda management with this very important investigation. What was it about? It concerned the dropping of charges against a major drug dealer without explanation and this person allegedly being handled by An Garda Síochána to entrap others. Those were the allegations in the public domain. They could not have been more profound yet in some cases, the GSOC never received documentation and in other cases, it took years. What the GSOC revealed was outrageous. It also revealed that the lessons of the Morris tribunal had not been learned in respect of the handling of informers, which was a core issue at the tribunal, and the retention of contemporaneous notes where people could check what had happened and where it could be clearly demonstrated if one was innocent. These were significant issues. When that was revealed, the Minister did not say a word of criticism regarding senior management in An Garda Síochána but kept schtum. When he was challenged repeatedly by my party, he kept schtum. He said he was waiting on the response from the Garda Commissioner. It took months.  People will argue that the Minister has too close a relationship with the Garda Commissioner and that the system of policing in this State is not healthy. The relationship between Government and senior Garda management is too close. The Government has the ability to appoint senior Garda management, which is an issue. We need to see a truly independent policing authority with its own independent budget allocated, of course, from taxpayers' money. That policing authority would then be accountable to this Oireachtas and a policing board, as is the case in Northern Ireland. We need to change our policing model, which is unhealthy. We have seen repeated examples of resistance to change and criticism - serious criticism in some circumstances.  This brings me to the penalty points debacle which we have seen played out in the Committee of Public Accounts. The two whistleblowers were pretty much vindicated by the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General.Let us go back to the start. Two officers discovered that the system was not working and that a considerable number of people were having their penalty points written off with no apparent explanation. It was one rule for the 70% of people who paid their penalty point fines and another rule for others. Basically, access to friends in certain places could get points written off. This was a serious matter that the officers reported to the confidential recipient. The transcript read into the record by Deputy Wallace and repeated in the Chamber by Deputy Niall Collins was interesting. I understand that it may enter the public domain in the near future. The officers were stonewalled. The matter went to the Commissioner's office, was investigated and ran on and on until the two whistleblowers eventually approached the relevant authorities. Under the Garda Síochána Act, they were permitted to take the matter to Members of the Oireachtas, as they did. They also brought it to the attention of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Taoiseach. Finally, the Minister made a decision. It was not to hold an independent inquiry into a serious matter with a significant amount of supporting documentation. Rather, it was to hold an internal Garda inquiry. The police investigating the police is not acceptable. There is no question mark over the integrity of the Assistant Commissioner, Mr. John O'Mahoney, but the perception was of police investigating police. It was a bad decision. When the publication was reported, the Minister went out to the plinth and, with the Commissioner, was more interested in having a go at the whistleblowers and calling them reckless and wild than in actually dealing with the substantive issues. Of course, that could not be allowed to sit for too long. The subsequent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General revealed that one in five motorists accused of road traffic offences was getting off, that a half of all summonses were not being served and that the scale of the problem identified by the whistleblowers was real and even wider than they had believed. This was a serious matter, yet the Minister still would not hold an independent inquiry. I challenged him in the Chamber on that after the report's publication. I almost pleaded with him. The matter then went to the Committee of Public Accounts and the rest, as they say, is history. The Minister has finally referred it to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission but considerable damage has been already done. The Minister must reflect on the model of policing and his relationships. Our party is conducting a comparative analysis between the policing and ombudsman models of the State and the models in the North and elsewhere in Europe. When it concludes, we will introduce the Garda Síochána (amendment) Bill 2014, which will contain proposals for change. Deputy Wallace did likewise last year and I commend him on the significant amount of work he did in that regard. I understand that others are also considering making proposals. We need fundamental change to both of our models. Let us be clear - the overwhelming majority of members of the Garda Síochána are doing a fantastic job. There is no question mark over them. They are on the front line defending our communities. In many instances, they are heroes. However, they feel let down by the cutbacks and the station closures. This point takes me back to the relationship between the Minister and the Commissioner. The latter echoes the Minister's language. He would call such measures ""modernisation"" or ""smart policing"" instead of acknowledging that they were really cutbacks - fewer Garda vehicles, stations and personnel. The number of gardaí will probably fall below the 13,000 template. It is an unhealthy relationship. We need change. As the Minister knows, the GSOC will appear tomorrow before the committee I Chair. We will put questions to it and seek clarification. For example, why did the GSOC believe it needed to consult its sister organisation in Britain, why did it believe it needed to bring foreign security consultants into the State under the cover of darkness and why did it not trust the apparatuses of the State? One can come to only a single conclusion. We will tease through these questions tomorrow, but the conclusion is that there is a serious level of distrust between the Minister's office, the office of the Garda Commissioner and the office of the three GSOC commissioners. This distrust must end. Tomorrow, we will probe the protocols of co-operation to see how they are working. I understand there are ongoing difficulties in accessing documentation, but we will tease through that matter tomorrow. When all of this is over and we have established the facts, what the citizens will need is an independent police force in which they can have confidence from top to bottom. They will need an ombudsman's office that has all of the powers it needs to protect the public and to watch the watchers. Lessons need to be learned. The only way to know definitively the level of the security breach at the GSOC is to publish the report of the security consultancy firm. I hope the GSOC will agree to facilitate that publication. When we see the report, we can have it independently verified. We need an independent inquiry into this matter. The public will demand it and need to know the full facts. They feel distrust, as they have seen too many issues arise. The hearings of the Committee of Public Accounts did little for their confidence. I will leave it to the Government to suggest what form the independent inquiry should take, be it a judicial review or an international body, but someone who is truly independent of the GSOC, the Department and the Garda must examine the issue and make a ruling. For all of our sakes, I hope it will be found that spying did not take place. Regardless of what happens, there must be fundamental change. Our party will put that to the Minister and engage constructively with him."	spk_348

The Minister said in 2008 Civil Defence funding was approximately €6.8 million and it is down to €4.24 million this year. That would suggest a cut of approximately one third but the Minister suggests those figures do not give the full facts. Maybe we will tease that through. The Civil Defence came back under the remit of the Department of Defence in recent times, which was supported by all Members of the House at that time as a sensible enough move.

He may not be able to solve every problem but meeting the representatives would be a good gesture, particularly following the activities in which they have been involved in recent times. They have been helping communities throughout the recent weather crisis. The Minister should try to engage with them in the next month or so to tease out the issues.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-02-06	dail	31	Departmental Bodies Expenditure	dbsect_12	Yes, absolutely. The Minister said in 2008 Civil Defence funding was approximately €6.8 million and it is down to €4.24 million this year. That would suggest a cut of approximately one third but the Minister suggests those figures do not give the full facts. Maybe we will tease that through. The Civil Defence came back under the remit of the Department of Defence in recent times, which was supported by all Members of the House at that time as a sensible enough move. The concern was that there would be an impact on training and resources going into those areas. Will the Minister engage with the Civil Defence Officers Association, the representative association?

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-01-28	dail	31	Health Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_30	As a representative of Donegal North-East, the best example I can give in dealing with the substantive issue in this debate is the case of Letterkenny General Hospital. As Deputies will know, a serious flood last year affected the hospital's new three-storey building as well as the older part of the hospital. Approximately 40% of the hospital's floor space was contaminated by flood water. It was an unprecedented level of crisis for a hospital in this State. The response of the hospital's management and staff to that incident, both on the night it happened and during the clean-up in the days that followed, was absolutely heroic. It has been a substantial challenge for them to hold the place together since that time. However, the hospital's accident and emergency department has been overwhelmed in recent weeks. Contrary to what some people have suggested, this is not solely as a result of the impact of the flood. It is a reflection of the historic neglect of the hospital. Letterkenny General Hospital is the seventh largest hospital in the State. Each year, it takes in approximately 21,000 inpatients, which is considerably more than some hospitals that have higher budgets. It is remarkable that it is designated as a general hospital rather than a regional hospital as it should be. It deals with 21,000 inpatients. It has the lowest budget allocation per inpatient and the lowest allocation of staff in the State. That has been the case for many years. It has been suggested to me that last year's flood and the response to it took the spotlight from the hospital's inevitable medical staffing crisis. The hospital has approximately six medical registrars, measured as whole-time equivalents, when it needs 16 of them. There is a real crisis in terms of that key component. It is not possible to sustain all the specialties in a hospital and man a 24-hour accident and emergency unit in the absence of the required number of medical registrars. I would like to conclude by speaking about the historic neglect of certain hospitals in various parts of Ireland. I refer, for example, to the manner in which junior doctors are allocated from the training hospitals. It is right that the taxpayer, through the HSE, subsidises those training hospitals. However, there does not seem to be a means of ensuring these key staff are allocated fairly to other hospitals. I want to use this debate to call for that to change. This is not some parish pump thing. The facts are the facts. It is a fact that Letterkenny General Hospital has the lowest budget allocation per inpatient and the lowest allocation of medical staff in the State. That was the scenario before the flood. We want to see the full restoration of Letterkenny General Hospital. I am not just talking in terms of capital. We need to ensure the hospital has enough staff to run effectively. I will make three recommendations in that context. First, Letterkenny General Hospital needs to be upgraded to regional hospital status. Second, there needs to be a fair allocation of staff and budgetary resources to the hospital, based on its number of inpatients. Third, and most immediately, there needs to be an allocation of medical registrars to the hospital, especially given that we have heard from the most senior staff at the hospital that it is facing a staffing crisis in this key area. I call on the Minister of State to pass this urgent message on to the Minister and Ministers of State at the Department of Health. The staff of the hospital should be met half way. The Government should respond to the heroism of the staff and management of the hospital by giving them what they need to do their jobs.	spk_442

I am very disappointed and it is a missed opportunity that it will not be incorporated into the Charities Act 2009. The reasons given are to do with technical issues for Revenue, but every year the Finance Act introduces a range of technical changes to deal with issues such as this; therefore, it is doable if there was the will to do it. Yesterday the Minister spoke about the five year review built into the Act, but we have waited five years for the Act to be implemented. It will not be implemented this year and is suggested it could be another five years before human rights will be incorporated. That is not acceptable. I must remind the Minister of State that her colleague, Deputy Joe Costello, is now the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development and promoting Ireland's track record in human rights. He works with organisations in advancing human rights in Ireland and abroad, particularly abroad, and deals with our overseas aid, of which we are very proud. The idea of regulating the charity sector did not come about in 2009. Those who have served in the House for a long time know the debate has taken place for many years. One Fine Gael Member recalled debating the issue in 2003. We know for a long time that this needs to happen and that the charity sector is not adequately regulated. However, there was considerable consultation with the charity sector prior to the publication of the Charities Bill in 2009 and it finally seemed that there would be regulation. The then Government dragged its feet for cost reasons and regulation did not happen. The current Government also did not proceed with it for cost reasons. That was a huge mistake. I fervently believe we would not be debating the CRC and the Rehab Group debacle if that had been done. The Minister chose to put on record matters of profound concern during this debate. I reiterate the calls on those running the Rehab Group to answer questions. They may well have satisfactory explanations regarding what was revealed and I hope they do but they need to answer these questions and restore people's faith. The Government parties have dragged their feet and there is a crisis in the charity sector. As many Members said, more importantly, this is about our most vulnerable citizens, including the elderly and disabled and those who are sick or ill. All of us have supported charities. They are being damaged by the actions of a few. If regulation had been in place, those actions would not have happened. While it is highly unlikely, I ask the Government to seriously support our Bill. The Minister suggested his Bill could be implemented towards the end of 2014. We should be clear that the legislation is not only about a charities regulator; it is also about a register of charities, the charities appeal tribunal and the consultative panels. A range of infrastructure is required to implement this legislation and not just a regulator.	spk_578

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-01-21	dail	31	Charities (Amendment) Bill 2014 [Private Members]: Second Stage	dbsect_30	"That is correct. Sinn Féin is using its Private Members' business tonight and tomorrow night to debate our recently published Charities (Amendment) Bill 2014. As most Members of the House will already be aware, this Bill seeks to amend the Charities Act of 2009 by ensuring that all the provisions of that Act are fully enacted by 31 May 2014. It also seeks to add the ""advancement of human rights"" on to the definitions of charities eligible to be registered, as outlined in the charitable purpose section or section 3 of the 2009 Act. I want to take Members briefly through the purpose of the 2009 Act before going on to discuss our Bill. The original purpose of the Charities Act 2009 was to reform the law relating to charities. It aimed to ensure greater accountability, offer protection against abuse of charitable status and fraud and also to enhance public trust and confidence in charities and increase transparency in the sector. The Act provided for the creation of a new charities regulation infrastructure, a charities regulator, a register of charities, consultative panels to advise the regulator and a charity appeals tribunal, and the Act laid down, for the first time in primary legislation, a definition of charitable purposes. The Act meant that organisations, which wished to present themselves to the public as charities, or fundraise directly from the public for charitable purposes, will have to seek and secure inclusion in the new register of charities. What we in Sinn Féin have produced is a short and simple Bill which is of the utmost importance not only to charities but also to the public in what has escalated to a crisis following the Central Remedial Clinic scandal. Our Bill seeks to ensure that the 2009 Act is fully implemented once and for all. Since the foundation of this State charities have been unregulated. The effect of this is now doing untold damage both to the charities but, more important, to all of the vulnerable people who depend on them. In 2009 Fianna Fáil published a shiny piece of legislation claiming to regulate the charities sector but never implemented it, thereby failing the charities and public confidence in them. Labour and Fine Gael have had almost three years to rectify this by fully enacting all the provisions contained within the Act but instead they rested on their laurels and dragged their feet, allowing scandal after scandal until it got so big that they had no option but to agree to the establishment of a regulatory authority. I thank the Minister for finally listening to the charities sector and Sinn Féin on this one. Unfortunately the failure to act on this issue over the years is what has created the scandal we are now witnessing. The next logical step is to support our Bill tomorrow night and ensure that the entire infrastructure arising from the original Charities Act is fully implemented by May of this year. Despite the fact that it is welcome and certainly a step in the right direction, the establishment of a charities regulatory authority by Easter in isolation is simply not enough. We need all provisions of this Bill enacted and we need it done as soon as is possible. The most vulnerable in our society are already suffering massively due to the deeply unfair and unjust cutbacks implemented by this Government. The failure to fund many schemes, on which many of our most marginalised people depended, has meant that more and more people were relying on charities for their very survival. Economically and in terms of the protection of people's rights, the charities sector has often had to step in and do what the Government has ceased to do.  The scandals which have erupted have, understandably, had a hugely negative effect on public confidence which has led to a dip in donations to charities. The recent revelations of generous salary top-up payments and gold-plated pensions paid from charitable funds at the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts hearings are proof that the sector needs regulation urgently. In a survey by The Wheel it was found that one in five charities around the country was facing a 10% dip in their donations even before the scandalous revelations about the Central Remedial Clinic this week. Of 150 charities surveyed, it found that 53% have suffered a drop in fundraising, 97% believe public trust has been lost and 54% believe the damage may be permanent. The survey also revealed that one in four has received concerned telephone calls or correspondence from donors or members of the public and 14% of volunteers, fundraisers or staff have been subjected to negative or abusive comments. It was also widely agreed by more than 80% that the Government had not done enough to implement the Charities Act 2009. The second aspect of our Bill relates to the inclusion of the ""advancement of human rights"" in the definitions under ""charitable purpose"" in section 3 of the Charities Bill 2009. This should never have been left out in 2009 and is seen as a serious omission. In other jurisdictions it is widely accepted that the advancement of human rights is a charitable purpose. There is also a knock-on effect in the failure to include this; for example, the principle of equivalence, which lies behind the Good Friday Agreement and which has directed much of the legislation in this area, is undermined as a result of this omission because as most of Members will know, human rights advocacy is afforded charitable status in the North. Despite the fact that existing human rights non-governmental organisations are protected, organisations established in the future to protect human rights will not be afforded charitable status. In addition, existing NGOs will encounter greater difficulties in raising funds because they will not meet the criteria set out in the legislation. The omission of human rights as a charitable purpose is a systematic and concerted assault on the human rights architecture of this State.  The Minister will bring in a Bill to amalgamate the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority later this year. There have been concerns around the significant cuts to funding, particularly in terms of the Equality Authority where the chairman stood down because of the huge cuts and the inability of the authority to do its job. This State is internationally respected in terms of our human rights track record in developing countries. We are a world leader in terms of our contribution We have not had any indication of the Government's position, but I hope it can support this Bill and work with us and we can work with it to make it happen. All of us, collectively, need to send a message from the House about the issue that has arisen at the Committee of Public Accounts and which has been handled expertly. The committee's hearings have shone a light of despair on a dark issue. People contribute to charities and Ireland is one of the leading countries in terms of what we contribute  It is clear to Sinn Féin that if we had not put this issue on the agenda, we might have been waiting until the end of the year. When asked about this last Friday morning, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, said it would be taken in October or November. He knows how Bills scheduled for late this year may be taken next year. The first step is welcome, but let us go the whole way and have the entire Act implemented. We should work together to restore confidence in the sector. I hope for all-party support tomorrow night and that we can work together to make it clear to the public that what it has seen at the CRC will never happen again in the charity sector. The money the public contributes should, in the main, go to those they hope to benefit. The concern about the burden of administration and managerial costs should be dealt with once and for all. I hope we can work together to secure a pass tomorrow night rather than a ""No""."	spk_553
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-01-16	dail	31	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_15	As the Tánaiste knows, Letterkenny General Hospital was devastated by a flood last July. A total of 40% of the floor space of the hospital was contaminated by flood water. The response from the staff and management as those flood waters were coming into the accident and emergency department and the rest of the hospital was nothing short of heroic. The heroism shown by the staff and management has continued since then with the extra hours they have had to work and the establishment of temporary departments. Prior to the flood, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I revealed that, based on the number of inpatients going through the hospital per year, Letterkenny General Hospital had the lowest hospital budget in the State and the lowest number of allocations of medical staff. Again and again, patients had suffered in Donegal because of this injustice. As I speak, there is once again a crisis at the hospital's accident and emergency department. Such is the extent of that crisis that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has said they are the worst conditions it has seen in 15 years. Patients across the county are being diverted to Sligo Regional Hospital.  I ask the Tánaiste to state whether the Government will remove the moratorium and allow the management of Letterkenny General Hospital to allocate the necessary nurses and medical staff to run the hospital effectively. Will it meet the heroism of the staff who have worked unbelievable hours in unbelievable conditions to keep that hospital going halfway and give them an additional allocation of staff to help them to do their jobs? 	spk_119

She was brought to that hospital at 5 p.m. last Monday evening and waited in the accident and emergency department for 14 hours in unbelievable conditions until 7 a.m. the following morning. Another woman who attended the accident and emergency department with her husband said:The whole unit was swarming and heaving with people, patients, bodies and staff. Our hospital was completely overwhelmed. There were no beds available in the hospital, the emergency unit was stacked to bursting.They are just two stories. Both families praised the nurses and doctors to the nth degree. They were certainly not the ones who failed those families and so many others. The Government's cutbacks and moratorium have led to this debacle. The Tánaiste knows that, I know that and every Deputy in this House knows that. When is the Government going to remove the moratorium on vital front-line staff to prevent scenarios like those described by these families? The dignity of their loved ones was taken away. That is no way to deliver a health service. The Tánaiste knows the reasons so I implore him to act. Everybody who knows about that hospital knows that the heroism was remarkable in keeping the hospital going. A total of 40% of its floor space was contaminated, which is an unprecedented crisis for a hospital. In light of the hours they worked and the fact that they did what they could, they cannot continue to be failed. They are literally at breaking point not just in terms of the accident and emergency department, but other departments. Will the Tánaiste stand up now, remove the moratorium and stand by the staff and management of that hospital? 	spk_121

This has thrown into sharp focus the Charities Act 2009 which has not been enacted and the need for a charities regulator. When will the Government enact the Charities Act? My second question refers to the mediation Bill. We are dealing with the Legal Services Regulation Bill. The reason the latter Bill was pushed so hard by the IMF and others was due to the cost of legal services for people in this State. However, the mediation Bill would have a much bigger impact in reducing costs by encouraging and enabling people in the context of family law and civil law to engage at an early stage before going the route of huge costs. The mediation Bill is on the B list, but that is not good enough. It might be available at the end of this year, but it is likely that it will be next year. Will the Tánaiste try to push that Bill forward?	spk_158

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	41	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2014-01-16	dail	31	Charities (Amendment) Bill 2014: First Stage	dbsect_18	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the full implementation of the unenacted provisions of the Charities Act 2009; to include the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose and to provide for related matters.The Bill aims to enact provisions of the Charities Act 2009. The Act was passed to reform the law on charities and ensure they were regulated. It was also to instil public confidence in that system and assist with the urgent and vital fund-raising activities of charities. We saw a run of stories before Christmas that impacted on confidence in the charity sector. Unfortunately, it had a negative impact on charities that had done nothing wrong. As a result, many of them have reported a loss of income. The Government has not implemented the legislation but has talked about the cost of establishing a regulatory office.It has engaged in a consultation process on how some of the law could be enacted without having to establish a regulatory authority. That is not acceptable, particularly in the context of recent revelations in relation to the Central Remedial Clinic, representatives of which are appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts today. This Bill seeks to set the date of 31 May 2014 in respect of full enactment of the Charities Act 2009 and to include therein advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose. Many of the existing organisations involved in human rights advocacy are charities that rely on fundraising and defend human rights not only in Ireland but overseas. We are very proud of the work done by these organisations, which is part of our infrastructure as a people in terms of our outreach to the outside world. Their omission from the Charities Act 2009 was unfortunate. As I said, the objectives of the Charities (Amendment) Bill 2014 are, first, to set a date for full enactment of that Act in order to restore public confidence and regulation of the charities sector. The charities sector desperately wants this to happen. The second objective is to extend the scope of that legislation to include advancement of human rights.	spk_205

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-12-17	dail	31	Third Report of the Constitutional Convention - Same-Sex Marriage: Statements	dbsect_27	I congratulate the Constitutional Convention on its excellent work to date. I had some reservations initially but I am pleased to see the Constitutional Convention take on a life of its own and begin to undertake the task of making some much-needed changes to Bunreacht na hÉireann. When the Constitutional Convention met in April 2013 it was meeting to consider same-sex marriage. The Constitutional Convention voted by a decisive majority in favour of changing the Constitution to allow civil marriage for same-sex couples. The convention's strong endorsement of equal marriage rights in Ireland marks an historic step in the campaign for marriage equality in Ireland and we are grateful to all members of the convention who made this happen. My party and I feel very strongly about marriage equality. As republicans, equality is at the heart of all we believe in and we strive for this every day in the course of our work and activism. We believe in a new republic where all citizens are equal, regardless of the colour of their skin, their religious belief, sexual orientation, where they live and what they do. Offering same-sex couples civil partnership is offering them a second-class right. This is absolutely and entirely unacceptable in 2013 Ireland. It is prehistoric, ancient and discriminatory. The time has come for marriage equality. This is a human rights and equality issue. Loving, committed relationships between two consenting adults should be treated equally regardless of gender or sexual orientation. All couples, same-sex or otherwise, should be allowed to share the same responsibilities, obligations and respect that marriage provides. This should be enshrined in the Constitution. We also need to see complementary legislative changes to equally recognise and protect all family forms, including non-marital families of all sexual orientations, and more robust general equality provision that expressly prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. Sinn Féin has a long-standing position of support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, equality in all dimensions of life and law, including the equal right to civil partnership, legal recognition of same-sex marriage and the equal right to found a family including by adoption. Any constitutional provision on the family must not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and must equally recognise Irish families in all their diverse contemporary forms. The 1937 Constitution should be amended to unambiguously enshrine equality in all aspects of life as part of a comprehensive Bill of Rights or Charter of Rights as required under the Good Friday Agreement, under strand three paragraph 9 on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity. Sinn Féin submitted a submission to the Constitutional Convention calling for a Bill of Rights amendment. We have been very pleased with the responses. Along with my party colleagues I have met a range of NGOs, stakeholders and people who campaign on human rights matters and it has been received very favourably. I cannot stress enough the need for a comprehensive Bill of Rights amendment that would follow a systematic review of the provisions of Articles 38 to 45, inclusive. The work of change was delegated to the constitutional review group in 1986. It was then continued, but was never finished, by the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution. The Government discontinued that committee in favour of the Constitutional Convention. As I pointed out earlier, the Constitutional Convention has done a fine job. Following the successful pilot period, the Government and the Oireachtas should now mandate a fresh Constitutional Convention in the same format with a broader and more comprehensive remit to address the two broad areas of a Bill of Rights and institutional reform in the 2014 to 2015 period and to introduce the remaining proposals for amendment in time for 2016. What better way to celebrate 1916 than by enshrining rights of equality within the Constitution? This would be more in keeping with the coalition parties' pre-election promises than the limited Constitutional Convention it authorised last year. While the convention, in its limited terms of reference, has been a very positive development and has worked better than most people had hoped, it needs to be strengthened. I welcome the Government's commitment to holding a referendum on marriage equality but it is of the utmost importance that the Government adopts a proactive approach to bringing forward the legislation to give effect to this referendum. We need a date for the referendum so that all relevant bodies can work towards this. I was sorry to hear the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, refer to referendum fatigue. This idea that the public is tired of referenda should not be held up as a reason for delaying the delivery of equality. It does not wash. I am sure we can all create the mental and emotional space needed to deal with the referendum, especially when it concerns the equality and the delivery of constitutionally entrenched rights. The Government charged the Constitutional Convention with making recommendations on such matters and it recommended that this be put to the people. Our reluctance to allow that process to flow unhindered will effectively undermine the credibility of the convention. Sinn Féin will actively and enthusiastically campaign to ensure the civil and legal rights of the LGBT community, including the right to marry, are fully protected in the law. Let me now make a personal reflection. I got married recently and this has brought me great happiness. The Minister was one of those who shared congratulations with me on my marriage. Like with all married couples, my and Sinéad's wedding day was a very special day. During it and the days leading up to and after it we felt the embrace and good will of family and friends all around us. This was a wonderful time in our lives. Among the guests at our wedding was a good number of gay couples. I had the privilege of attending the marriage of one of those couples in Spain and that was a powerful day. There have been many civil partnership ceremonies all across Ireland and more people have had their eyes opened to how important it is to allow two people who love each other to marry. The words of Barack Obama on this issue were very simple, but powerful. He spoke about two people who love each other, who want to step up to the plate, if that is their choice. Some people do not get married and their love is equally as valid as that of those who are married. If two people who love each other want to step up and say they want to make a life commitment in every legal way they can to the person they love, that should be facilitated. The day Sinéad and I got married, I felt a tinge of sadness that we were able to get married, but in our presence were couples who loved each other every bit as much as we did and who had made a commitment in every way they could to each other, but who could not have the same equality or moment we had. The sooner that day comes and the sooner I can go to their weddings the better. I know we live in a diverse society and that we must respect everybody's perspective. There are people who profess to follow the word of Christ, but who use the word of Christ, as they interpret it, to oppose the right of two human beings who love each other to be married. These people are wrong. I am a Christian and I have faith in Christ, but I cannot for the life of me understand how people who believe in the Christ I love and in whose teachings I believe can advocate that Christ of love, compassion and every good thing we learnt about him and believe in and oppose the right of two human beings, two children of God who love each other, to have that moment to say they commit themselves to each other for as long as they both wish. I was deeply moved by the comments of Barack Obama and by those of his remarkable wife, the First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, who both used their words so powerfully. They challenged those powerful forces in American society who opposed same sex marriage by simply speaking about two human beings who love each other. I wanted to share this with the House because we had a wonderful wedding day. Marriage equality was our theme on the day and we used the rainbow colours of marriage equality throughout the day. Sinéad's bouquet was the marriage equality colours. Our wedding day was a powerful day. I ask everybody and I am willing to discuss it with them over a cup of coffee or in whatever forum they want, to think about the reasons they oppose same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is not a threat to marriage between man and a woman or to the love or status of these couples because of the marriage of two other human beings. I thank the Chair for indulging me on this contribution.	spk_362

It is the eyes in the air providing crucial intelligence. I will not get into it but the criminals need to be very worried about the technology it provides to assist gardaí on the ground to capture people who are a threat to the public. They have great enthusiasm for what they do. The only concern is that I got a sense that hours have been cut back over recent years. The cutting edge they can give gardaí on the ground is remarkable and my concern is that the Garda helicopter is in the air for fewer hours than in recent years. Rather than turn it into a political football, since everybody in this House would agree that we need to give them everything we can, I urge the Minister to examine that area to ensure we give them every support we can into the future.	spk_66

That will be covered in any review of the case but maybe the process could be reviewed. If one has an underlying condition that rules one out there is no point going through everything else.	spk_59

We also visited the Garda air support team. My question is to establish the levels of support we can give them. With their professionalism and dedication the Minister will agree that we need to give them everything they need.	spk_64
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-12-11	dail	31	Garda Resources	dbsect_13	What I found really interesting, and which may not be commonly understood by the public, is that one presumes air support is to back up a Garda pursuit but it is used for all sorts of support to the Garda. It is the eyes in the air providing crucial intelligence. I will not get into it but the criminals need to be very worried about the technology it provides to assist gardaí on the ground to capture people who are a threat to the public. They have great enthusiasm for what they do. The only concern is that I got a sense that hours have been cut back over recent years. The cutting edge they can give gardaí on the ground is remarkable and my concern is that the Garda helicopter is in the air for fewer hours than in recent years. Rather than turn it into a political football, since everybody in this House would agree that we need to give them everything we can, I urge the Minister to examine that area to ensure we give them every support we can into the future.	spk_66
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-12-11	dail	31	Bethany Home: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_37	As I begin my contribution on this matter, I am mindful that behind me is the statue of James Connolly, as well as those of all the other leaders who fought in the 1916 Rising. Many people share my view that James Connolly was the greatest Irish person who ever lived and that the courage and values he espoused, which are imprinted into the Proclamation, will forever be a framework for the Irish people. However, it was not just about James Connolly because he was inspired by those who came before him, just as Members are today, such as Michael Davitt and James Fintan Lalor, who had a vision for a society that was fair and just. After the execution of James Connolly, people such as Liam Mellowes, about whom I saw a documentary the other night, came to the fore. These were people who really believed in equality and fairness and in everyone having a chance in life. Their values, courage and message were hijacked by conservatives, by people whose vision was narrow, mean and cruel and who besmirched the promise of the Proclamation very quickly after partition and the treaty. It is no accident that Bethany Home came into being in the year of the treaty and the foundation of the new State. I cannot understand how the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, can wipe her hands of this issue. Anyone with basic knowledge of history knows the regimes that ran the State in the decades that followed its foundation pursued an agenda that put poor children and mothers into homes. How much more evidence does one need? One can research the newspapers and people such as Niall Meehan have demonstrated clearly and beyond any reasonable doubt that this State was culpable in putting young mothers and leaving children abandoned in this home, as well as in so many others. It is incredible that when some people enter Government, the bean counters sometimes influence their direction, that is, those who know the cost of everything and the value of nothing, to use Oscar Wilde's famous phrase. I refer to the people who always look at the bottom line rather than what is right or what is the right thing to do. One should remember that these people who controlled the State with the willing consent of the Governments that had been elected during those decades, be they Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil-led or whatever, would call themselves Christians. Regardless of whether they were Protestants or Roman Catholics, they professed to follow the lesson of Christ. What would Christ think about what was done in his name in Bethany Home? What would Christ think of the 222 children who died because of meanness, cruelty and harshness and of enforcing one's moral values on people and simply perceiving them as pieces of dirt? That is what happened in the State. That was the history of the State for decades, in which the promise of men and women of values, of passion, of equality and of decency were besmirched and buried. Now is the time for Members to set right these things and they must do it. I sat through the presentations given in Leinster House earlier this year and I do not believe there was a dry eye in the AV room when Derek Leinster and Patrick Anderson-McQuoid, two people who are decent to the core of their being, to their bone, gave their testimony. I simply cannot understand how any politician who heard the evidence and testimony or who saw the compelling evidence put together by Niall Meehan and others can deny these people and these families their justice. Members must do the right thing and must do what is right. How, with all the evidence of history and all the multiples of reports, newsreels and everything that is available, can Members deny they owe a debt of service to the citizens who the State failed? Members owe an apology to those who have been so cruelly failed in the past. I am aware this motion will be voted down late at night. Sitting opposite me on his own on the Government benches is a Minister of State who has absolutely no responsibility for justice and equality. He is the only representative of the Government in the Chamber this evening. I have nothing against the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, personally but for God's sake. Last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was in the Chamber rewriting history. I will reiterate what I have stated previously on such occasions, which is that my party does not claim to have a monopoly of decency. I believe the vast majority of parliamentarians in these Houses to be thoroughly decent people. However, what will happen here this evening, when this motion is voted down, is indecent. I ask the Government to reflect on this and to deliver justice to those families who were failed as part of that hijack of the Republic for decades by people who besmirched the Republic and besmirched the name of Jesus Christ to keep people down in oppression. While those days are over, Members must now heal the wounds and give justice and a simple apology to those who suffered at their hands.	spk_633

I acknowledge that much of this time has been spent consulting with stakeholders and the experts in the field. It is important to stress to all Deputies the importance of speaking with our partners in the NGO community and to the experts working in these fields. We may be the people tasked with legislating, but we are not the experts. We need to ensure we are speaking to the people who know what they are talking about. Once again, we are here discussing rights. As a republican, I believe that all citizens are equal and that we need to work to ensure that all citizens on this island are afforded the rights they so justly deserve. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that all persons with disabilities must have equal recognition before the law. This means that those with diminished capacity must be given the same legal rights as everyone else. As we all know, Ireland has signed this convention, but cannot ratify it until new capacity legislation is in place. This is because without legal capacity, other rights guaranteed by the convention cannot be achieved. The legislation in this area is old and archaic, dating back to 1871, and is much in need of reform. The Bill as presented is much improved from its predecessor, the Scheme of Mental Capacity Bill 2008. There are a number of important changes included in this Bill which I and my party welcome. In particular, I welcome the fact that, at its core, this Bill affords the opportunity for an individual to make legally binding agreements with others to assist and support them in making their own decisions. I am firmly of the belief that everyone should have the right to benefit from assisted decision making. Therefore, we welcome entirely the provisions of this Bill, but we believe the positive support measures contained within it should be open to all as well as being accessible, inexpensive, easy to use and flexible. We also need further clarity on the legally binding nature of assisted decision-making agreements. Access to supports should not be based simply on a functional assessment of mental capacity. There has been a suggestion that the Bill could use a lower threshold for ability to make an assisted decision-making agreement that has been successfully adopted in British Columbia. This would make such support measures accessible to more people, while retaining safeguards to protect against abuse. We will try to develop this on Committee and Report Stages, but is this something the Minister of State and the Minister might consider? It is something I may seek to amend on Committee Stage. There is no doubt individuals who currently have a good network of support will find this Bill beneficial. However, can we enhance it by introducing a positive obligation on State bodies to provide individuals with opportunities for developing natural supports which can be then used as the basis for creating legally binding agreements? Another important addition would be to give people more choice and control in deciding who will assist them with making these very important decisions. Many organisations involved in this area have argued that the substantive provisions dealing with decision-making representatives and informal decision makers should be amended to place a stronger emphasis on the will and preferences of the person. The Bill provides a broad range of powers to informal substitute decision makers, who are not subject to the same scrutiny as other kinds of substitute decision makers under the Bill. This concerns me.Is there a risk the wide scope of powers given to informal decision-makers could undermine the positive support provisions of the legislation, such as the assisted and co-decision making agreements? I concur with those who argue these powers must be significantly restricted in scope, and accompanied by a duty to explore assisted or co-decision making with the individual as an alternative. I have spoken to a number of organisations which argued that people should have a real ability to challenge decisions made under the Bill. In particular, people who are subject to more restrictive measures under the Bill must have a real ability to challenge the appointment of substitute decision makers as well as the decisions they make. This should include the right to independent advocacy for people subject to the Bill, including the immediate and full commencement of the personal advocacy service provided for in the Citizens Information Act 2007, and learning from the valuable experience of the National Advocacy Service. Further safeguards are needed to address conflicts of interest between the individual and substitute decision makers. There should also be an obligation on State bodies to investigate cases where there may be a conflict between the person and the substitute decision maker. The legal aid provisions of the Bill must be strengthened to ensure an automatic right to legal representation, regardless of means, when an application is made to court for a declaration of an individual's mental capacity for a decision. This is essential to ensure effective access to justice for people affected by the Bill. The costs of court applications and expenses of decision making assistants, co-decision makers, and decision making representatives should not be automatically taken from the individual's estate. This will pose a significant financial barrier to people seeking to realise their rights under the Bill. The Bill must interact with the Mental Health Act and other relevant areas of law. The lack of interface between the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill and the Mental Health Act 2001 must be addressed, ensuring people treated in approved centres can benefit from the positive provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill. The Mental Health Act should be amended to reflect the provisions of the capacity legislation. A commitment to reform other laws relating to legal capacity excluded from the provisions of the Bill must be made by Government to ensure compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This includes laws on consent to sex, voting, jury service, marriage and civil partnership. The Bill must provide safeguards for people who are detained against their will, no matter where the detention happens. The Bill does not acknowledge that people who are not wards or detained under the Mental Health Act can be unlawfully detained, such as people 	spk_366

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-11-21	dail	31	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	There are reports in this morning's media that the Garda Commissioner has demanded the return of files from the Committee of Public Accounts with regard to the penalty points debacle. I hope the Tánaiste agrees that this a disturbing development. We can recap what has happened. Two Garda whistleblowers were very concerned about practices surrounding the termination of penalty points. They reported concerns to the internal Garda confidential recipient in March 2012 and the issue went nowhere, so the whistleblowers were essentially stonewalled for months. In autumn 2012, under section 62 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, the whistleblowers passed their evidence to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, as they are entitled to do. No investigation that we are aware of had taken place within An Garda Síochána until the information was passed. The people in question were discredited and talked down afterwards. An internal Garda investigation that followed was not in the public interest, and there should have been an independent investigation. When the results of the investigation were published, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, sought to discredit the whistleblowers and downplay the extent of the scandal. There were ongoing attempts afterwards to discredit the Garda whistleblowers, but they have now been vindicated. We now have the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which reveals that one in five motorists facing offences got off and half of all summonses that should have been served for road traffic offences were not carried through. It was a widespread problem and in some districts there were 50 times as many terminations as in other districts in the State. It was a major issue. We have seen revelations that senior journalists and one State solicitor allegedly had penalty points terminated. The public must know all the facts. Will the Tánaiste ensure that the Committee of Public Accounts can do its work with the evidence it has and reveal the full facts of what was a scandal? Thanks to the whistleblowers, such events should not be repeated, as there are now clear directives to all gardaí concerning the termination of penalty points and the framework in which gardaí operate. Will the Tánaiste stand by the whistleblowers and protect them from this latest assault?	spk_196

I can only talk about my community but I will, in the first instance, talk of my family. My grandfather had to leave his home and work on building sites across England, be apart from his wife and bring back the money to build a modest home in Buncrana. He was away for long periods, leaving behind a heartbroken wife and family. That was not just his story but that of his community. When it came to my father's time, he left his home town of Buncrana before he was 15 years of age to work on the building sites in England to become a man long before his time working in steel fixing and hard labour. Almost all of his peers, all young people in his school photograph, followed that path of emigration to Britain. When it came to my time, I had to leave when I was younger to get work. That has been the story of rural communities throughout the history of the State.That has been our reality. In Donegal today, once again the spectre and dark cloud of emigration hangs over us, as 49% of our young people between the age of 18 and 24 are unemployed, according to CSO figures. That masks major emigration in all those communities from the Inishowen peninsula, where I come from, as well as in the north, west and south of Donegal. Every GAA team and soccer team can tell a story of struggling to continue to field senior teams, and there has been a loss of a whole generation of our young people because of a failure of political leaders in the economic crisis. It comes despite the debates and issues we have rehearsed in this forum. That is the scale of the crisis and the reality in the community I come from. I have no doubt the Minister is aware of this as representatives of Fine Gael and Labour are in those communities as well. We all feel the same. Everybody watches ""Reeling in the Years"" on television and from time to time I have seen images of the current leadership of the Labour Party when they were student leaders. They were young idealists and people who promised to change Ireland from what had come before it, the Ireland Raymond Crotty had so painfully painted in his book  How can the Labour leaders look back to the young activists they were, remembering days of idealism and promise in the Labour Party, while they stand over what has been done? At what point will they admit that it would take €400 million to really have a youth guarantee and keep our young people here, reversing a trend that has occurred throughout our history. That is what it would take and the Government has the power to act. It is about choices. The Government used to blame the troika but it is not here anymore; the Government definitely has nobody to blame. The justifications have rung hollow and there is no more room for them. The Minister must explain this to the next generation of Labour Party activists, who have put a vote of no confidence in the party leadership. They will have to explain how this issue will be changed and how the Labour Party will return to the young people at its roots and the images we have seen in the images of ""Reeling in the Years"". It is a challenge and the Government has two more years. I appeal to the Labour Party to work with us and others on the left who want to give hope to these young people and provide a future for them. It is a choice and I hope the Government acts on it in the next two years."	spk_325

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-10-17	dail	31	Cochlear Implants: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_13	I find it hard to believe that we are arguing for this. Perhaps I am naïve, but I thought this was a no-brainer and that the Government would stand up in the House on Tuesday and announce it had made funding available for bilateral cochlear implants. Alas, that was not the case. I am proud to stand in solidarity with these kids and their families and friends. Our party is committed to ensuring that the Government makes funding available as soon as possible. A year ago, when Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and I were at the Disability Federation of Ireland pre-budget event, I called for a threshold of decency on disability supports. That is a promise from members of every political party and none and a political consensus that they will not cut supports for disability. Unfortunately, we have not signed up to the threshold of decency idea. In a real republic all citizens are equal, but not here. These profoundly deaf children are not equal, despite the fact that we can change this relatively easily. Last year, we were struck by the bravery of citizens with profound disabilities in protesting outside Leinster House at the cuts made by the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly. The courage and dignity of those who braved the elements to make their stand shone a light on the reality for them, their carers and their families. Despite the promises of both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in the final pre-election leaders’ debate last year, the Government has proceeded to enforce cut after cut on those with disabilities in this State, their families and their carers. Their broken promises on disability are the cruellest of all. In Ireland, profoundly deaf children receive only one cochlear implant. This is the same as providing a child with glasses with only one lens. It is wrong, cruel and unacceptable. These children have a limited time window for the implants to be successful; dragging our heels is simply not an option. The cost is a measly €12.58 million in the context of the overall budget and the impact it will have. It is unthinkable that the Government cannot do it, as it is a small price to pay to give children the opportunity to hear. I attended a briefing in the AV room prior to the recess with the Happy New Ear group and Dr. Laura Viani, the surgeon with the cochlear implant programme in Beaumont Hospital. I was really touched by the plight of these children and their parents. It is simply outrageous to consider that Ireland's vulnerable children and children in need being ignored due to budget restraints. The importance of early intervention for these children is immense. The younger they are treated, the more chance they have of catching up with their peers and continuing life through mainstream education without a requirement for special needs schooling. By delaying treatment, the Government is increasing the risk that these children will develop additional needs, which will result in a greater cost to the State. This is a matter we can do something about. We can give these children the gift of hearing for relatively little expense. Why can the Government not commit to this? These children deserve to live their lives as their friends do. I watched the famous debate in which the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, the presumptive Government at the time, were asked about their number one priority. In terms of social justice, they said the number one priority was disability support. There were promises in the programme for Government and the national disability implementation plan. The Disability Federation of Ireland stated:The disability movement has been hit hard by harsh outcomes [...], the social infrastructure that exists to support them has been decimated and the initiatives announced today do too little to reverse that. Yet again there has been no commitment from Government to support people with disabilities and their families.That is the verdict of the Disability Federation of Ireland on the budget. The Minister of State sat at the debate last year and was offered the opportunity to examine the threshold of decency. This is about decency. It is indecent not to provide just over €12 million so that the children involved can have the opportunity to live their lives to their full potential. We cannot address many disabilities and there are many in respect of which we can only provide support for carers or try to alleviate or ameliorate the impact. In contrast, this is one we can fundamentally address. I cannot understand it. The Minister of State and I canvas at election time. In my years in public life, I have never met a voter who said that he or she did not want me to deliver on disability support but wanted me to protect the wealthy and ensure there was no wealth tax for the very wealthy in society. No voter ever asked me to protect the wealthy or to ensure a child who needed a second cochlear implant would not get it. I never claimed that our party had a monopoly on decency. Deputies and Senators of all political perspectives in this House are thoroughly decent people who have given their lives to public service. What the Government is doing and the policies it is pursuing are indecent. The Minister of State can attend Disability Federation of Ireland events, give a spiel, make commitments in the programme for Government, put in place plans and table amendments to this straightforward and simple Private Members' motion, referring to a new review group and a new clinical care programme, but these political promises will be broken. Who wants it to happen? Not so long ago, the Minister of State insisted that she had to vote down equality budgeting, even though it is Labour Party policy.	spk_525
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-10-17	dail	31	Cochlear Implants: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_13	"Why do we need equality budgeting? We need it because of the spectacle today, where parents, who are heroes, are in the Gallery advocating for their children. Every parent and every carer for a disabled person is a hero, but we have failed them in politics because we make promises and then they are broken.Equality budgeting solves that because it ensures that every single budget measure, intervention or new policy from a Department is subject to an equality impact assessment, and the vulnerable who are failed repeatedly by politics are protected by legislation. That is why it is so vital to bring in equality budgeting and protect those who are most vulnerable in society. The Minister of State is aware that this is wrong. She will make a speech and tell us that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is conducting a review and they will have a programme and do their best subject to budgetary constraints. Is that what she entered politics for? When she was a much younger woman, with all the progressive ideals that she had at that time, and the equality and fairness for which she stood, did she ever imagine she would find herself in the seat opposite right now having to defend the indefensible? At some point, one must search inside one's self and ask, ""How can I stand against equality budgeting?"" How can she allow the wealthiest in Irish society to have another celebration? The champagne bottles were probably popping all around Ireland to celebrate because they had been let off the hook again. That is how one frees up resources. We have shown the Minister of State how she can free up €1.4 billion by asking the very wealthy in Irish society to contribute, yet all we need here is €12 million - she can work out the percentage. It is about choices. The Minister of State can choose to defend the vulnerable in Irish society. She can choose to protect those who need our support, who have nobody else to protect them and who are failed repeatedly by politics and promises, or she can merely blame it on somebody else. There is no hiding place on this one. There is no big bad troika. There is no big bad Fine Gael. This is a choice. When the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, puts her head down after all her years in politics, puts her head on the pillow and looks back, she will see this was not her greatest moment. Deputy Lynch should turn this around. She has the power. She is in government. She has a strong bloc of TDs and Senators. She has significant power. She can change this. She has two more years for her legacy. I appeal to her to go back to her roots to find Kathleen Lynch, the younger woman who started this journey, and stand up for the rights of those here. If she can do so I will be a happy man but, more importantly, there are a great many across this State who will celebrate with me. I wish her good luck with that."	spk_527

The rightful position of women in Irish society is as equals in every way. The 1937 Constitution should be amended to entrench unambiguously women's equality in all aspects of life as part of a comprehensive bill or charter of rights. Constitutional recognition should also be given to the unquestionable economic and social value of unpaid domestic, agricultural and care work. This should be gender neutral, encompassing in particular care of children, the elderly and people with disabilities. It should be complemented by constitutional protections for economic and social rights in a bill or charter of rights, including the equal rights to work and to an adequate standard of living. Despite the fact that the likes of Mrs. Justice Denham and others have interpreted the real function of Article 41.2 as being to recognise unpaid care work and that it can be construed as gender neutral in a modern context, for avoidance of doubt it would be preferable if this clause was removed in favour of robust and comprehensive equality guarantees for women in the context of a bill or charter of rights. Removal or amendment of the clause is not enough. Women need unambiguous constitutional guarantees to enable them to hold the State accountable under law for all violations of our equal rights, be those through actions or failures to act such as in the case of the Magdalen women, the death of Savita Halappanavar, the one in five women who experiences domestic violence and the one in four women who experiences sexual violence or other sexual abuse in her lifetime. If unpaid care work is to be constitutionally recognised for its economic and social contribution to the life of the State, it should be done by way of a gender-neutral clause recognising all such work, including by men. This work should no longer be, and is no longer, the exclusive domain of women. The increasing contribution of men should be encouraged and recognised as necessary to women's equality as well as to the overall quality of Irish life. This latter proposal is in keeping with the recommendations made by the Constitutional Review Group, CRG, and the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution, as well as the UN Human Rights Committee, the Irish Human Rights Commission - to bring it into line with Ireland's equality obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and with the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, respectively - and most of the civil society submissions. The Constitution should guarantee women's equal representation and equal access to participation in public life, particularly in public leadership and management roles. As one way of implementing this guarantee, our party supports the introduction of gender quotas as a special temporary measure to accelerate the equal - at least 50% - representation of women in the Parliament, the Executive, local councils, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Judiciary, State boards, semi-State and other statutory public bodies and any other organisation that is in receipt of public funding. We support such quotas with a view to their earliest possible obsolescence as such equal representation becomes normalised and entrenched. Gender targets could be incrementally phased in, for example, starting on a 30% or 40% basis if necessary, but the ultimate goal is a 50:50 gender balance within short order. One of the advices to which I have always been drawn is that an economy should serve society, not  Regarding constitutional measures, we can support the introduction of 50:50 gender quotas for political party nominations for all elections and ministerial appointments, as well as for judicial nominations and appointments to State and semi-State boards of management and to the boards of other statutory bodies and those in receipt of public funding. Gender quotas for elections should be met by way of a list system. However, if supported by appropriate and sufficient general constitutional guarantees of equality, equal representation and access, such quotas could also be introduced by way of ordinary legislation. As my party has supported affirmative action measures to achieve equal representation of Northern Nationalists, we believe that consideration should also be given to whether there should be constitutional commitments to increasing diversity and representation in public life through affirmative action measures for under-represented groups, for example, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities such as Travellers and people from Ireland's new communities. The quotas that Sinn Féin has implemented work. The highly capable women of our party are coming out of their backroom roles where they were and still are concentrated. This corroborates the strong evidence from other jurisdictions that experienced rapid increases from low bases and where women's representation is highest. Claims are made regarding evidence of lower corruption where women's representation is higher. These claims are correct. If true, this could be of significant benefit to society and politics more generally. Increased women's participation in electoral contests could raise the overall quality of representation by widening the candidate pool. This could also help redress a notable problem in politics, leading to improved decision making. I would also ask that the convention consider, under item No. 9, provisions to diversify political life further and to increase representation of minorities, for example, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities, such as Travellers and the new Irish. Our party has submitted a proposal to the constitutional convention, entitled ""A Bill of Rights Amendment"", calling for provisions to be more properly contained within a comprehensive and robust bill or charter of rights. This could be considered under the open remit of item No. 9. A bill of rights is an outstanding commitment under the Good Friday Agreement that must be honoured. Perhaps the likes of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, or the Irish Congress of Trade Unions could preside over a debate on how to clarify the rights of citizens in the Constitution for advocates and citizens instead of leaving it to Supreme Court justices to interpret. I will briefly address some of the initiatives that Sinn Féin has taken to ensure gender equality within our party. Its objective is to reach 50:50 representation of women and men among our membership, leadership and elected representatives. I am proud to say that our party constitution commits us to gender quotas with respect to our internal leadership. We have a policy of incrementally increasing quotas for women candidates at all levels of public office, starting with a target of 30% and increasing to 50% as soon as practicable. To increase the immediate representation of women and the likelihood of re-election through incumbency, we have adopted a policy that all seat co-options should be to women until such time as the 50% target is met.In the Assembly we have adopted a practice of gender equality in ministerial appointments. We have also increased our female general membership to nearly 30% and will be adopting a plan to pursue further increases in the participation of women in Sinn Féin. I welcome the outcome of the convention's deliberations on this topic. I am glad that in 2013 we are moving towards removing the archaic and outdated clauses within our Constitution. I wish the convention all the best for the remainder of its time."	spk_131

Such attempts have faced a number of obstructions, most notably in 2008  Sinn Féin believes the lawful and effective collection and use of forensic evidence from crime scenes, victims and suspects can be crucial for obtaining sound convictions that are not based on confession evidence alone, a practice that has led to widespread abuse of due process rights. I note the fly is now beside me. Clearly it is attracted by microphones.	spk_213
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-10-09	dail	31	Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill 2013: Second Stage	dbsect_12	It is a fan of oratory. In some cases, forensic evidence also can be crucial to avoiding wrongful conviction while the true culprit evades justice. The use of forensic science to solve criminal cases is growing globally. A multidisciplinary field that embraces chemistry, physics, botany, zoology and medicine, forensic science includes the identification of human bodies or traces. Traditional methods such as fingerprinting and trace analyses are still used with the assistance of computers. In addition, forensic dentistry, voice and speech spectrograms, blood analysis and DNA analysis are increasingly applied. A wide range of powers and procedures are now available to enable the Garda and indeed the PSNI to take, compare and retain crime scene evidence, including photographs, fingerprints, footwear impressions and objects including suspected weapons or parts thereof, as well as the taking of intimate samples for evidentiary comparison. Sinn Féin acknowledges the need for collection and analysis of forensic evidence. However my party is also aware that forensic science is constantly evolving and the degree of its accuracy is a continual matter of debate among experts. For example, in 2009 a debate emerged among forensic scientists on whether a certain type of internal bleeding seen in infant deaths can only be caused by the shaking of a baby, which finding generally results in a murder conviction. Closer to home, in 2007 Sean Hoey was acquitted in the Omagh bombing case as a consequence of the judge’s rejection of the validity of the low copy number, LCN, DNA profiling technique that has been used in more than 21,000 serious crime cases in the British jurisdiction and internationally, particularly in cold cases. These are two of many situations in which the use of forensic science is at the very least uncertain and potentially could lead to perversion of justice. Sinn Féin therefore believes that ongoing research is needed in a variety of areas where forensic methods and definitions, both newly emergent and established, are being used in court for the prosecution of persons. Notwithstanding the above, most methods of forensic evidence gathering are accepted by Sinn Féin as being generally relevant and necessary methods of criminal investigation where applied to the appropriate standard by trained personnel and under appropriate supervision and monitoring. While I welcome the main thrust of this Bill, Sinn Féin has several concerns it would like to raise and on which it may seek to include amendments. At the core of this debate, one must remember that any prejudice to the presumption of innocence must be eliminated. One cannot move to a position in which people without criminal records are being treated as potential suspects for future crimes. One of my main objections to this Bill relates to its providing for the taking of samples such as mouth swabs or hair follicles from some former offenders who no longer are subject to sentence. This is stated in section 33 of the Bill, where it states that a sample may be taken from a former offender. I ask the Minister to clarify at a later stage whether that means this Bill will not have due regard for the Good Friday and Weston Park agreements. Is it compliant with these agreements because, initially, this seems contrary to the workings thereof? A concern would arise in respect of the retention of anything related to former political prisoners released under the Good Friday Agreement. The ICCL has highlighted another concern in the form of international co-operation, specifically concerning how samples or DNA profiles generated from such samples or both may be transmitted to other states, including outside the European Union. Again, I call on the Minister for clarification. Will the role of the proposed DNA database system oversight committee extend to reviewing the appropriateness of the date protection safeguards in place in states to which samples or profiles may be transmitted? I agree wholeheartedly with the ICCL that as a matter of principle, profiles or samples should never be transmitted to states that cannot guarantee they will protected by appropriate privacy safeguards. I also ask the Minister the reason this Bill was never submitted to the Irish Human Rights Commission for its consideration.	spk_215

I will be brief. I reiterate this Bill should have been referred to the Irish Human Rights Commission. I also wish to talk about innocent people who were affected by this in the past. On a practical level and noting the Minister's assurances, is he satisfied the forensic science laboratory has the necessary equipment, resources and staff to meet the demands of this Bill? There is no point in passing this legislation only to be faced with poor resources. Function creep is another issue of concern with this Bill and Sinn Féin does not want to see a situation in which there is a gradual widening of the database beyond the purposes for which it was originally intended. I wish to conclude by warning that although there are many positives to a DNA database, one must keep in mind that they can put innocent people at risk. This is particularly the case as technology has developed to allow the generation of DNA profiles from the tiniest of DNA samples. In the Omagh bomb case LCN DNA evidence produced a partial match to a six-year old schoolboy in Nottingham who was on the British database. He was quickly eliminated from the investigation but imagine if he had been an innocent man in his 20s living in the Border counties?	spk_219

Before the summer recess, I commended him on many good innovations in the Bill we were debating at that time. This is also a very welcome Bill and, as Deputy McConalogue said, there is much common sense contained in it. On balance, we very much welcome it. I cannot help noticing the amount of legislation which comes through this portfolio and other legislation which amends existing legislation, such as the Fines Act 2010, which has never been fully implemented. I wonder how this process can take so long. The original Act came into being in 2010 and here we are three years later amending it. Why has it only ever been partially commenced? Surely there is a better way to legislate than this. That aside, I welcome this Bill which strives to modernise the courts fines system and offer alternatives to imprisonment to those who have been found guilty for failure to pay a fine. I was pleased to hear the Minister, when he launched this Bill in July of this year, reiterate his commitment to keeping to a minimum the number of people committed to prison for the non-payment of fines. In effect, the Bill will ensure there are substantially fewer prisoners in our jails serving short sentences for non-payment of fines. This is something about which I feel very strongly given that prisoners are hugely costly to the State. We know that each prisoner costs us more than €60,000 per year. If one breaks the figure down in respect of short sentences, one can see that we really need to think about our whole imprisonment strategy. My office undertook an exercise and spent some time attempting to cost the difference between imprisoning people who were guilty of minor offences, in particular those sentenced to fewer than six months, versus imposing community service on them. The results were quite striking. The saving that can be made from this change alone is potentially tens of millions of euro. I would be happy to share that finding with the Minister. The Irish Penal Reform Trust has told us there were 8,304 committals to prison for fines default in 2012, which we can all agree is a very significant figure. However, the more significant statistic here is that more than 85% of people imprisoned for non-payment of fines return to prison within four years. Unfortunately, this highlights that for some people, they would prefer to serve time in prison than pay a fine, in particular, as the statistics show, if they have previously spent time in prison. For some who have already spent some time in prison, being sentenced to a day or, as the Minister demonstrated, in most cases, a couple of hours in prison is really no deterrent at all when it comes to the non-payment of fines. The system in its current form is not working and needs reform, so I am glad we are finally moving towards this. I take the opportunity to speak briefly about the important work undertaken by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in its report on penal reform in March of this year. I fully support all the recommendations contained in the report and look forward to working towards implementing them. The first recommendation of the report was a reduction in prison numbers via a decarceration strategy, reducing the prison population by one third over a ten year period. The second recommendation was to commute prison sentences of fewer than six months, recommending that all sentences for fewer than six months imprisonment imposed in respect of non-violent offences should be commuted and replaced with community service orders. As I said, that is not only desirable in terms of wanting fewer people in prison but it would save a lot of money for our taxpayers. It is preferable having people working in community service and giving something back to their communities than being in prison for short periods of time. According to the Irish Prison Service, 272 people were jailed for non-payment of television licence fines in 2012. This is a prime example of where community service should be used as a real alternative and an opportunity to make people give something back or do something positive for society. In this Bill, there is the option of instalment payments or attachment orders. The whole process makes sense. We do not want a situation where people, in particular elderly people, face prison sentences for non-payment of the likes of television licences. I welcome section 5 which ensures the court will impose a fine based on the person's ability to pay it and the effect it may have on that person's dependants. The system should take into account a person's ability to pay a fine when it is being set as this is fair. However, I have some reservations around how the financial circumstances are defined in terms of a person's property. I would like it clarified as to whether there is a possibility that debt may be recovered via repossession of the family home. This may be something on which I will seek to submit amendments on Committee Stage, but we can discuss it further on that Stage. Section 6(2) has made a change to the Fines Act 2010 with which I do not agree. I appeal to the Minister to retain the 24 month period as opposed to changing it to 12 months. This makes sense given the current financial climate. There is also a suggestion from the Irish Penal Reform Trust and some other non-governmental organisations that a flat administration fee or a cap be put on fines as opposed to the 10% charge set out in the Bill. I would like to hear the Minister's reasoning behind this 10% charge. Obviously, it is an administrative fee but why is it 10%? Again, this may be something I will seek to amend on Committee Stage. In regard section 6(6), it is regrettable that there is no instalment option for fines of less than €100. For many individuals and families in the Ireland of 2013, €100 is still a significant amount of money and could make a very significant impact on a family. I will seek to amend this section to remove this. Regarding section 8, the IPRT has recommended that consideration should be given to setting out a maximum level or proportion of receivers' fees where property is seized. I would have to agree with them on this aspect of the matter. In terms of section 11, it is worth querying if it may be beneficial to provide for community service or attachment of earnings rather than imprisonment to be pursued as the next option in cases where there has been a failure to recover assets. I would like to conclude by reiterating my overall support for this Bill. I commend the Minister on introducing it. As I believe it marks a step in the right direction, I do not want to be overly negative about it. However, I have some concerns around some aspects of it. As I have indicated throughout my speech, I intend to submit amendments on Committee Stage to strengthen the Bill where I feel it could be strengthened.	spk_418
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-09-25	dail	31	Cuts in Education: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_30	"As a proud Irish republican, I believe that all citizens are equal and that education is a fundamental right and not a privilege. I have often heard the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, use the terminology ""citizens"", and it is right that he does. However, with that terminology comes its natural extension that citizens have a right to an education that takes them on the path to achieve their full potential. The way in which Sinn Féin views education certainly is not shared, on the basis of the evidence, by the present Government or its Fianna Fáil predecessors, whose past track record and current policies are ensuring that only the more wealthy sections of society will be able to progress to higher education. This is a view that is reflected by a recent survey carried out by the Irish League of Credit Unions showing that parents increasingly struggle to pay for their children's third level education. The average monthly outgoings of a student amount to €1,000. This is the unacceptable reality, in which the increasingly punitive costs of attending college mean that in the forthcoming academic year alone, an estimated one student in 12 will be forced to drop out of his or her course because of financial pressures. Countless more aspiring students will not even be able to consider higher education as an option because of their limited income. How ironic that it is a Labour Party Minister who is overseeing and implementing such regressive cuts, which are institutionalising a two-tier education system. The financial barriers that are denying access to a third-level education contradict much of what the Labour Party is supposed to stand for. It also makes a mockery of the Government's claims to be prioritising a knowledge-based economy that supposedly is so important for our economic recovery. In this context, I refer to the issue of masters studies. How many times have Members come across people who wish to continue their education by completing their masters degrees? However, while the Government will not fund such studies, it will pay them €188 per week to be on the dole. If one does the sums, it would cost less to allow them to continue with their education and to have a better chance of being re-employed. This single example alone demonstrates it simply does not make sense. All this rhetoric perhaps is unsurprising and I refer to the famous signing of the USI banner. While I acknowledge the Minister has stated that he profoundly regrets so doing, nevertheless he signed that pledge and then within weeks of being in government, there was a reneging on that promise and a U-turn. The students will not forget that and each year, when they lobby the political parties, as they will again soon, they will point to that episode. This is the reason Sinn Féin has brought forward its proposals for equality budgeting because political promises can be and are broken. The only way in which to protect citizens' rights is to have equality impact assessments of budgetary measures that are in place. I note this is the Minister's party policy, against which he voted when Sinn Féin tabled the Bill to give effect to such measures. I urge the Minister to reflect on that. People today sought to have their pledges signed and Sinn Féin did so. I assure the Minister that Sinn Féin intends to honour these pledges in respect of equality budgeting if it ever has the chance to sit on the Government side of the House. The importance of the maintenance grants cannot be overstated as approximately-----"	spk_470

I have many more pages to read as there is so much more I could say. I believe the Minister knows in his heart that the cuts he has implemented are wrong. I heard him speak of the €100 million he may be obliged to cut and how he is fighting to lessen that amount. The Minister is an intelligent man and knows this is absolutely crazy stuff. During a recession and private sector contraction, the role of the Government is to invest, particularly in the education system, to ensure that people can prepare for when the upturn comes, as well as investing in infrastructure. These measures are established rules of thumb and the Minister is aware that what is happening at present does not make sense. As I always point out in such debates, I do not presume that Sinn Féin has a monopoly over decency. What is happening, however, is indecent, is wrong and does not make sense. At some point, I hope the Labour Party recovers its soul and fights to stop this in government.	spk_472

When one considers the pressures on the Supreme Court at present the Bill is necessary. A total of 605 cases were appealed to the Supreme Court last year, which is a 21% increase on the year before. It issued judgments in 121 cases compared to 64 judgments issued by the US Supreme Court and 85 judgments issued by the supreme court in London. When one considers the respective population sizes this is not sustainable and must change. We know from international best practice that if the Supreme Court is clogged up with appeals it is not able to focus on one of its most important functions, which is being a check on the Executive, examining the constitutionality of legislation, interpreting the Constitution and fulfilling its crucial independent role in our State and democracy. I hope this will free up the Supreme Court. There will be ten judges, which we also welcome, who will be led by the Chief Justice. Arguably this is a very exciting development in terms of the potential of the Supreme Court to move to the next level but there is a little concern. I appreciate when we have discussions about judicial appointments that the Minister is rightly determined to defend the integrity of the Judiciary and to demonstrate it is independent. As I have stated previously, the eight Supreme Court judges are people of impeccable qualification and capacity, and arguably the most talented group we have had in the history of the State. Earlier today when discussing the Legal Services Regulation Bill a point was made with regard to perception, and there is a perception that political appointments are not truly independent. Particularly in terms of the Supreme Court we need to see judges who are really independent of thought and have no fear whatsoever of challenging the Government and holding it to account, and clarifying matters of legal importance. I read an interesting article earlier this week which expressed concern. The bulk, if not all, appointments to the Supreme Court are from the High Court and therefore we can see their track record in terms of challenging the Government, and now we have freed up the Supreme Court to have this badly needed space to fulfil one of its primary roles and to begin to be more creative and imaginative in terms of challenging the Government we also need to ensure a good balance in how it is made up. Irish society comprises people who are liberal and conservative and come from various backgrounds. We need a Judiciary, particularly at Supreme Court level, which is representative of the various perspectives in Irish society in terms of the decisions it makes. We will continue to debate this issue. I know the Minister is examining judicial appointments and I hope before the end of term to see legislation, which will have to be brought by the Minister, which will ensure judicial appointments are entirely independent of the Government. There is no question whatsoever about the independence of the Judiciary and it can fulfil its very critical role in our democracy."	spk_195

The Minister will appreciate that we support the objective of the Bill. One of the initial objectives was to ensure accountability in judgments in family law courts and to have a reporting system to ensure same. The Minister has tried to provide a counterbalance in the Bill of protecting the privacy of the parties, in particular where children are involved. There is more work to do on the ""bona fide"" issue. It is too much to ask the parties in the court and their legal representatives to ascertain the position. I have not tabled an amendment on local media, but I am concerned about the issue. The Minister is aware that the media are present in the District and Circuit courts and family courts are held in the Circuit Court. The journalists represent a newspaper and according to the Bill are bona fide. If they report different aspects of a case in a local newspaper, it does not take much of a stretch of the imagination for people to work out basic details and identify people even when the parties are not named. In a city, one might not be aware of a divorce or separation across the street, but in rural areas one is, particularly where children are involved and families are in dispute. In the case of large, extended families, narratives could be put out by either side. Sadly, that occurs all too often.If we do not have a fairly tight restriction with one bona fide representative and with these checks and balances in place, I am concerned that we would be on dangerous ground. We also discussed the issue of contemporaneous reporting. A reporter could go online or on radio to report a case that, unfortunately, somehow manages to identify families. People may even wrongly assume which family is involved, in which case children could face teasing or other difficulties. I appeal, therefore, for more caution concerning the bona fide representatives. I appreciate that the Bill gives a judge a fair degree of discretion, but I am not sure if it is tight enough around these issues. I ask the Minister to consider the matter further."	spk_210

It is a thoughtful contribution and it is overdue in terms of what we need. Much of the focus in recent times has been on issues that are certainly important but they are not the most important in terms of what we need from An Garda Síochána. I believe every Member of this House would agree that the overwhelming majority of the men and women in An Garda Síochána are people of the highest calibre. We are very proud of them, we know them personally, we went to school with them, we played football with them and when we leave our children to school or go to the supermarket we meet them. They are an integral part of our community. They are proud of what they do. That is not the issue. The issue here is about the power we bestow on them, the great power and responsibility we give them on behalf of our communities and the fact that some within An Garda Síochána have abused those powers. Unfortunately, we have seen in the history of all organisations that at some time power is abused. Therefore, we need checks and balances to protect our citizens from the abuse of power but also to protect the good name of An Garda Síochána and the good name of the overwhelming majority of gardaí who have never abused power and who have often spoken out against it. I commend in particular the whistleblowers who have raised issues of considerable public importance to their own personal detriment. Long live whistleblowers. In terms of the existing issue of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, the Garda inspectorate and other institutional changes, they did not fall out of a tree. They followed the debacle of the Morris tribunal in my home county where a nest of vipers who were not worthy of the name ""garda"" had abused their power in the most appalling fashion. The Morris tribunal revealed that sorry saga, particularly the use of informers and in some cases so-called informers to gain promotion. It was an appalling period in my county's history. Mr. Justice Morris made a series of recommendations and they were to have been implemented. That is what gave birth to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission but unfortunately from the outset it did not have the powers it required to hold the Garda to account. If there is any doubt about that, it was blown away by the report that the GSOC has given to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner in regard to what is known as the Kieran Boylan affair, the fact that a convicted drug dealer, allegedly in possession of cocaine and heroin worth €1.7 million, had charges dropped against him without any explanation. That investigation, which took four years, exposed a number of deeply troubling issues. As stated by the GSOC, it showed that the lessons of the Morris tribunal have not been learned and that it has grave concerns about the handling of informers and the retention of contemporaneous notes, which are critical to retrospective investigation. That is the reality. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, which also recently came before the committee that I chair, the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, has confirmed that it has faced serious blockages in its investigations. At times senior gardaí have questioned the relevance of the documents that it has sought to attain. There is a real need for serious additional powers to be given to it. That is the reason this legislation is so important. Sinn Féin would put forward proposals to strengthen it. We would work with the Deputies here on Committee Stage if the Bill was allowed to go forward, and it should be, to try to strengthen it. We believe there should be an independent policing authority. We would like to see more of the powers of accountability that are in the North of Ireland. We would also like to see a good deal of what is in place in terms of the Policing Board of Northern Ireland replicated in terms of joint policing committees. The joint policing committees in this State need to be strengthened. We need to ensure that the Garda is completely independent from the State. We cannot have a situation any more where Ministers appoint senior gardaí and they in turn defend cutbacks, the closure of Garda stations, and reduction of Garda vehicles numbering in the hundreds, in the face of the clear evidence to the contrary from the Garda Representation Association and gardaí on the ground.The days of a  When this Government came into power, it said it would act as a trailblazer. We heard exciting speeches about a new day and a new Republic. In that context, it is outrageous that this Bill was rejected as it was by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, last night. If the Government wants to make clarifications or changes, that can be facilitated on Committee Stage. I think the Deputies who introduced this Bill have made an excellent contribution. All Bills can be strengthened and tweaked. If the Government is sincere about independence, political reform, the protection of citizens and the integrity of serving members of the Garda Síochána, it will accept this Bill and amend it as necessary. Of course we know that the Government has proven that it is failing in this regard. That is a serious disappointment to our people. Nonetheless, the Opposition will continue to advocate for change in this area."	spk_454
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-07-11	dail	31	Thirty-third Amendment of the Constitution (Court of Appeal) Bill 2013: Second Stage	dbsect_11	"This Bill provides for the establishment of a new court of appeal. A referendum is required to make the necessary constitutional provision for the establishment of such a court.If the referendum is passed, the new court of appeal will hear appeals from the High Court, and the Supreme Court will hear cases on appeal from the court of appeal and, in exceptional circumstances, from the High Court. This reform would, as we all know, bring about a major change in the courts system and ease the four-year backlog of cases at the Supreme Court, which would in future take only appeals on constitutional issues or cases of major importance. Sinn Féin supports this legislation and the proposition that the question be put to the people. We are currently in a situation where some very important cases of a constitutional nature are waiting a number of years to be heard. I firmly believe this should not be the case. I welcome the idea behind the legislation before us which seeks to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, the Bill does not specify the number of judges who will sit on the new court and we are told that this and the age of retirement, pension conditions and remuneration will all be set out later in legislation. I want to take the opportunity to speak briefly on the issue of judicial appointments. We have had opportunities to engage on this in the past, but I would like to add to what has been said. As the Minister knows, I launched the Reform of Judicial Appointments Procedures Bill earlier this year. I did so in the hope that this would put an end to the system of political appointees being made judges. This should not rule out people who have been involved in politics. It is healthy for citizens to be involved in politics, but we would like more accountability in terms of the process. Our Bill would amend the way in which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board operates in order to increase transparency and accountability in judicial appointments, a reform which is badly needed. Confidence in the justice system is contingent on a Judiciary which is free from political control or political or other bias and it is essential that there is an independent and impartial Judiciary which is representative of the community it serves. I appreciate there have been excellent articles on the eight current judges who sit on the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice, in the press recently. When we look at their respective CVs, we see they are people of eminent qualifications. However, sadly, when people are appointed politically, this leaves an impression we need to deal with. We cannot have a situation where there are questions regarding the appointment of people who love the law, are extremely talented and are committed to the service of the people because of the process of their appointment. Future judicial appointments should be drawn from a wider pool of qualified candidates, which in turn would enhance confidence in the justice system. For too long, throughout the length and breadth of the State, we have all been aware of stories relating to how judges were appointed with a wink and nod after demonstrating their loyalty to either Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats or whoever. The days of the old boys' club, which dominated the legal and political spheres in Ireland, must come to an end. They have failed our people. The practice of the Government appointing judges, senior judges in particular, must be ended if the public is to have any faith in a Judiciary free from political or any other bias. The sheer number of judges appointed politically adds to an already embedded and unfortunate public perception of the Judiciary. We in Sinn Féin call for the establishment of a fair and accountable appointment and removal process for the Judiciary that involves meaningful lay participation representative of the public interest. We believe that judicial independence is undermined by the current appointment process in the 26 counties. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was established in the wake of the controversial appointment of Harry Whelehan as President of the High Court in 1994 and was meant to have removed sole discretion for judicial appointments from government. However, there is still political involvement in the appointment of the Judiciary as the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board merely provides a short list of seven qualified candidates to the Government, which then makes the appointments of judicial officeholders. The appointment procedures should be transparent in order to enhance public confidence in the process. The current Government promised to be a reforming government and to put an end to the ""jobs for the boys"" culture but, looking at its appointments so far, it is clear a number of them are of people associated with the Fine Gael and Labour Parties. This is unfortunate. I also want to speak about the need for a judicial council and the capacity for people to raise their concerns. We need full accountability. The majority of people in the Judiciary who have served the State down through the years were people who were eminently qualified and who had every right to be where they were. They have given considerable service to the State, particularly those at the higher end. Consider, for example the eight current members of the Supreme Court. I have no doubt they are all eminently qualified and love the law and the work they do. However, we need to put an end to the current process of selection. Our Bill provides for this. I know the Minister has concerns, but the Bill can be amended and tweaked. We need to get to a point where we have a small shortlist, preferably a list of three, from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. The list should outline the reasons for their selection and the Government could then outline the reason for an appointment. This process must be set out in a way that can be shaped, argued and debated. There must be no question mark over the appointment of a member of the Judiciary so that they remain and are bona fide genuinely independent.  Another issue is that the Supreme Court decides on matters of constitutional importance. Therefore, we need a balance in the Supreme Court of people from different perspectives. To understand the need for balance, all we need to do is to listen to the debate that took place in this House till 5 a.m. This House of 166 Deputies is representative of Irish society. Participants in the debate were people from the left and people from the right, people who are liberal and people who are conservative. We need the Supreme Court to be genuinely representative of all political perspectives in the State. That is why it is important that the appointments are independent and strike the right balance, particularly given the powers these judges have in terms of the Constitution and its interpretation and in terms of holding governments to account. Access to the courts and to justice is a constitutional right, yet the expense of these can run into extremely high figures, thereby acting as a barrier to people seeking to exercise this right. We know that if cases move faster, the chances of reducing costs are better. Another point I want to raise concerns the referendum. We have put dozens of referendums to the people of the State over the years, some with greater success than others. The Constitution belongs to the citizens of the State and they reserve the right to change it as they see fit. We owe it to the people to do this in an appropriate fashion. We need to ensure that when this eventually goes to the people, they understand exactly what they are being asked to vote on. We need to explain the question in as clear a way as possible and explain both sides of the argument in a clear, balanced and open fashion. The plan envisages that the new court of appeal will deal with most cases that are currently dealt with by the Supreme Court, which would therefore reduce the higher court's workload and allow it to focus on the development of the law. There are to be two tests to decide what types of appeal the Supreme Court will hear: the first is public importance, and the second is where it is in the interests of justice that the appeal by heard by the highest court in the State. In exceptional circumstances, where these tests of public interest and the interests of justice are met, the Supreme Court will be able to hear appeals directly from the High Court. The Supreme Court in Ireland, unlike equivalent institutions in other common law jurisdictions, is the court of final appeal, not only for constitutional matters but for all appeals from the lower courts. Figures published this week by the Courts Service show that the court received 605 appeals last year, a 21% increase on 2011. It gave judgments in 121 cases, compared to 64 in the United States Supreme Court and 85 in the Supreme Court in London. It is important to welcome the creation of a new court, where proceedings take place within a reasonable time, as an inefficient court system is costly. Runaway legal costs must be tackled. I commend the reform efforts being made in the context of the debate on the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Second Stage debate of which will take place tomorrow. This Bill includes some very important and welcome reforms. This is good governance and we need more of the same. I also applaud the Minister on his concept of a separate family law system.Many exciting announcements have been made in the past few weeks. Credit where credit is due. My job is to oppose and hold to account, but it is also to acknowledge when things are moving well. Let us have the backlog in the Attorney General's office addressed, if we can. Good legislation needs to move quickly. We need to get the Legal Services Regulation Bill moving in the autumn as the delays have been very frustrating. While we may not agree on all the changes the Minister seeks to bring forward, we will probably agree on more than we disagree on. There are many exciting developments on the way in the reform of the courts system and its efficiency. I hope we can have the judicial appointments issue addressed and I will work with the Minister in the next few years to develop that debate. This measure is welcome and we will support it. While we need to talk about the wider reforms that need to happen in the Judiciary, there are many welcome developments. I offer my support to the Bill and ask the Minister to take on board some of the concerns I have highlighted."	spk_201

That is acceptable. The Minister has, once again, taken the opportunity to include miscellaneous provisions on a range of other issues that needed to be addressed, and that is fine. However, on Tuesday last, the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, stood up and gutted a Bill presented by my party in my name on equality budgeting in legal provisions that protect the most vulnerable in society, and it was dismissed because it did not contain enough references to other Acts.

We were shattered by this. The approach the Minister has taken is fine. He has identified issues that need to be addressed and this is the vehicle to do it, but he used that approach to attack a perfectly good Bill that we were inviting him to amend and allow to go to Committee Stage. I take the opportunity to make that little complaint. I will try not to use any more unintentional puns for the rest of the speech. I welcome the spirit of this Bill. While I and my party have some concerns as regards the need for safeguards, we are broadly supportive of the Bill and will seek to submit amendments to reflect this and improve it where we feel it may be lacking. First, I will deal with the section with which I have most concerns, namely that which relates to reducing the application of the  I agree with the Minister when he stated that media access and the reporting of cases will add transparency to the conduct of family law and child-care proceedings and will provide valuable information on the operation of the law in this area. However, I am concerned about how this will work in practice. Should this Bill become law, it means that only bona fide representatives of the press would be allowed into court. I am particularly concerned about the term ""bona fide representatives of the Press"". Who are these persons and who deems them to be ""bona fide""? Will there be an accreditation process in place to ensure that these persons are the appropriate ones to have access? There is a sense among legal practitioners that the term ""bona fide"" is generally understood across the board. Perhaps this is okay for the legal world, but will it offer much needed comfort to the young victims coming before a court? We need to ensure that the procedures put in place inspire confidence in these persons. My colleague in the Seanad, Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, submitted an amendment on this issue calling for an accreditation process, which was not accepted. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this. I will be submitting an amendment along the same lines when the time comes.Another concern is the number of journalists who will be given access to certain cases. Is there a possibility that allowing more than one journalist into a court at a time could also be problematic? I note the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, highlighted that this could be a problem:Allowing more than one journalist into any case could be problematic given that each journalist may include and exclude different details from their reports which individually might protect the identity of a child but collectively could expose them.She raised concerns about local media reporting of cases of this type and how this would make it all the more difficult to disguise the identity of the child in question. I come from a rural area and I can understand this concern. When a marriage breakdown occurs in a local area, there can be rumours. Two parties and their families are involved. People often fall out as a result and become estranged and there can be tensions. Narratives are sometimes put out by one side in order to demonise the other party. Information is often known and circulating in those communities. It would not be too much of a stretch of the imagination that a local newspaper, even when making efforts to protect the identity of the parties, might put a spotlight on the case. I ask the Minister to consider how to ensure that the element of local reporting does not draw attention to the individuals involved. It is a real challenge that we need to work through on Committee Stage. The Ombudsman for Children also raised concerns about contemporaneous reporting of cases, as a child may hear or read a report of a court case and realise the story was about his or her case. There is a chance that this would deter a child from continuing with the case. I ask the Minister to reassure the House that safeguards will be in place to avoid such occurrences. He has indicated that he will address some of the concerns raised by the Children's Rights Alliance and the Ombudsman for Children. Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and others will table amendments on Committee Stage, as will the Minister, and the concerns can be discussed further. The second provision in the Bill is to increase the monetary jurisdiction of the District Court and the Circuit Court. It is hoped that in time this will allow for a reduction in the fees charged to clients and, hopefully, the costs of litigation in the long term. I am confident that this may ease pressure on the higher courts. The changes to the monetary jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts is a positive step, particularly as it is two decades since a review was carried out. Any measure that leads to a reduction in fees, thus reducing the cost of taking a case for ordinary families and businesses, is welcome. We hope that the knock-on effect will be to reduce the costs for the State over the longer term. I also note the comments of the Law Society. It is concerned that the District Court, and particularly the Circuit Court, will not have enough resources to deal with the pressure that will inevitably be placed on them by the dramatically increased workload. There will be a need for more judges and more court staff in order to avoid delays, given that there is already too much pressure on the system. I ask the Minister to provide the resources necessary to ensure that the full benefits of this legislation can be implemented. Part 4 of the Bill provides for additional judges for the Supreme Court, which is very welcome, as is the proposed constitutional amendment which will be debated later this week. The Supreme Court judges, who are very talented, will then be able to devote their time to dealing with issues of wider public concern. The Minister is correct to take advantage of this opportunity. Part 5 deals with juries and is a sensible proposition. It allows for up to 15 jurors to be sworn in to ensure a minimum number of jury members for lengthy trials. I commend the Minister on taking the opportunity in Part 6 to provide for legal advice and legal aid. This provision is overdue. Part 7 is a technical provision relating to the Personal Insolvency Bill. The Minister indicated that he reserved the right to introduce further amendments on Committee Stage, which Sinn Féin will monitor carefully. The Opposition has real concerns about some key aspects of the Personal Insolvency Bill but the Minister's amendments seem to be technical amendments relating to how the courts will deal with personal insolvency cases. This Bill is a welcome development, albeit with our caveats and concerns. I look forward to engaging with the Minister on Committee Stage to see if the Bill and the protections it proposes can be strengthened."	spk_288

As an Irish republican, equality is at the core of all that I believe in. I believe in a new republic, one in which all citizens are equal regardless of the colour of their skin, their religious beliefs, their sexual orientation, where they live or what they do. We are appealing to the Government via the legislation before the House to implement equality budgeting.  Creating the conditions for establishing an equal society means recognising that many diverse groups and sections of society need enhanced protection from the State. This Bill amends the existing legislation and aims to provide for equality proofing, through impact assessments, of Government policy and budgets as well as public bodies. The legislation will ensure that, in exercising their functions, the Government and public bodies do so in a way that is designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome that result from socioeconomic disadvantage. The Bill recognises those additional sectors of society that require enhanced protection from the State in respect of policy and spending decisions. While we all know that times are hard, what some of us fail to recognise is just how difficult they are for some of the poorest and most vulnerable. The Government came into office on a wave of promises in 2011. Soon afterwards, however, it became apparent that many of its plans involved taking from some of the most vulnerable. A study carried out by TASC revealed that lone parents, the group most at risk of poverty, lost the highest percentage of income in budget 2011. Low-income workers are disproportionately affected by austerity measures, such as the universal social charge, which is a highly regressive tax in that it comes into force at its highest level of 7% at just above the minimum wage. Women make up the majority of workers earning the minimum wage or slightly above it. They are also more reliant on public services and welfare provisions, all of which are being severely curtailed by the Government. This applies, in particular, to women with children. Cuts in health expenditure have also resulted in reductions in services for people with disabilities. Recent budgets have resulted in cuts in the disability allowance, carer's allowance and carer’s benefit. We continue to see increases in inequality and poverty and there is growing evidence showing the disproportionate impact economic policies have been having on disadvantaged groups since the beginning of the economic crisis. Equality budgeting has been internationally accepted as a means to deal effectively with inequality and poverty. Worldwide, more than 60 countries have adopted or are working towards equality budgeting. These include the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Tanzania and Uganda. The time has come for Ireland to follow suit and make a stand by providing a more just and equitable society for all. Creating true equality sometimes requires that we put in place mechanisms to ensure this objective is achieved. This is one of those times. If we were to adopt equality budgeting, we would ensure that equality is placed well and truly at the centre of any decisions concerning public expenditure and income. I will now outline some of the specifics of the Bill. The existing Equal Status Act 2000 came into force on 25 October 2000 and was amended by the Equality Act 2004 on 19 July 2004. The Acts relate to discrimination based on the following nine grounds: gender; civil status; family status; age; race; religion; disability; sexual orientation; and membership of the Traveller community. They apply to people who buy and sell a wide variety of goods, use or provide a wide range of services, obtain or dispose of accommodation and attend or are in charge of educational establishments. Separate provisions apply to clubs practising discrimination. All complaints must relate to at least one of the nine discriminatory grounds listed. Sinn Féin's Equal Status (Amendment) Bill 2013 aims to achieve a number of objectives. It seeks to add new and additional anti-discriminatory categories to the existing nine categories. These prohibit discrimination on the grounds of trade union membership or socioeconomic background, which is very important, as well as discrimination against Irish language speakers, former political prisoners who served their sentences before the Good Friday Agreement or were released under its terms, and rural dwellers.It seeks to introduce equality impact assessment schemes and consultation on a statutory compulsory basis by all Departments and public bodies where they are introducing any new measure, policy or budget detailing what adverse impact this may have on the existing nine and, it is hoped, the additional six anti-discriminatory categories proposed in the Bill and how they intend to better achieve equality of opportunity, or would better eliminate or lessen existing discrimination. They must have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. The equality impact assessment scheme of each Department and public body will be assessed for compliance and monitored by the Equality Authority of Ireland, which will become the human rights and equality authority later this year when the legislation is passed. It will offer advice as per guidelines detailing the statutory duties of all Departments and public bodies. Departments and public bodies will publish the results of their equality impact assessments and state the aims of the measure, policy, budget to which the assessment relates and give details of any consideration given against the duty to promote equality of opportunity and against the existing nine categories and, it is hoped, the additional six proposed. The Government and public bodies in carrying out their functions must have regard to reducing the inequalities of outcome which result from socioeconomic disadvantage. A system for complaints against Departments and public bodies will be introduced also and overseen by the Equality Authority of Ireland. The authority may approve a Department's scheme and will have the power to modify it or request the Department to make a revised scheme. Each Department and public body must publish an annual report on the operation and performance of the scheme. Through equality audits and impact assessments, equality budgeting provides information on the economic impact of policy measures on different sections of society. Inequality and poverty are on the increase in Ireland. The gap between the richest and poorest in Ireland increased by 25% in 2010, with the top 20% earning 5.5 times the income of those on the lowest 20%. The percentage of people in Ireland living in consistent poverty increased in 2010, as did the percentage of children at risk of poverty, which stands at 19.5%. We know that economic policy measures introduced since the beginning of the economic crisis are having a disproportionate impact on certain sections of society, thereby exacerbating inequality and poverty. Equality budgeting makes sense. It is fair and just. I am asking all Deputies in the House and particularly Government Deputies to allow the Bill to progress to Committee Stage."	spk_326

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-06-28	dail	31	Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Bill 2013 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_2	"My home town of Buncrana has an interesting link with the fight to end slavery. On 8 April 1748 a slave trader named John Newton limped into Lough Swilly on his boat The first few lines are evidence of the miracle: ""Amazing grace! How sweet the sound/That saved a wretch like me."" He was a wretch. He was a slave trader. He was an awful man but his life was turned around by that moment of salvation for himself and his crew, not immediately but over time. He went on to work with William Wilberforce, one of the greatest parliamentarians of all time, who campaigned, from his early days in Parliament and throughout his life, to bring an end to the slave trade in Britain. What John Newton brought was the seal of a man who had been responsible for absolute brutality towards, and horrendous treatment of, so many people, taking them from Africa across to the British colonies and trading and moving them around as so many others did. Wilberforce worked with him and the abolitionists against all the odds. There is a film called ""Amazing Grace"" which does great justice to their story. There are scenes of Wilberforce in parliament confronting Members of Parliament who represented traders who benefited from the trade. He could not have been speaking to people more opposed to him, yet he achieved his aim. It was a great achievement. One would think that was the end of the story and a period in history to inspire us all, but slavery continues today. The trafficking of human beings as it continues today, for whatever purpose, is grotesque, barbaric and completely unacceptable in 2013. Human trafficking is humiliating, dehumanising, abusive and exploitative, and robs people of their dignity and of their very person. More often than not it is the most vulnerable in society who are trafficked, making this all the more heartbreaking. I commend the Minister on his introduction of this Bill and Sinn Féin will support it. As we all know, this Bill will transpose some important provisions of the EU anti-trafficking directive into domestic legislation, and we welcome this. Sinn Féin and I welcome the inclusion of a definition of forced labour, which is something many of us in this House, and many NGOs, have long been calling for. Although the previous legislation criminalised forced labour in a formal capacity, it failed properly to define it. The definition brought in here follows that of the International Labour Organisation: ""All work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the person has not offered himself voluntarily."" This definition offers clarity where previously there were difficulties in identifying and securing convictions for trafficking for forced labour. Previously, while trafficking for forced labour was an offence, forced labour and servitude in and of itself was not an offence. In the North this was brought into law under the British Coroners and Justice Act 2009. It is crucial to note here the importance of all-Ireland and all-island harmonisation on an issue such as trafficking. Recommendations that we do this have come from further afield too. The US State Department recommended that Ireland consider measures which would ""explicitly criminalize forced labor and other forms of compelled service"". Similarly, the OSCE special representative and co-ordinator for combating trafficking in human beings stated that ""the introduction of an autonomous offence of forced labour could be an additional tool to tackle the criminal phenomenon of labour exploitation."" The legislation also provides that public officials who are found guilty of certain trafficking offences in the course of their public duties will face harsher sentences. This is in line with the directive and is appropriate. It recognises that a person in such a position is in a position of responsibility, and has a certain duty of care to the victim, that to abuse that responsibility is a crime of particular seriousness, and that therefore there should be particular penalties to discourage that crime. It is important that we acknowledge why we are discussing this Bill. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence yesterday issued an all-party recommendation on prostitution. We know that a considerable number of women - and it is almost always women - coming into the country have been trafficked here, usually for reasons of economic disadvantage. They have been brought here under false pretences and spend their lives in drudgery in houses and apartments across the State. We have to put an end to that and confront Irish men who think it is all right to visit a website and avail of these women. We must confront the culture and tell them about the reality of these women's lives, where they came from and how they got here. I am very proud that the committee's recommendation was agreed by all parties and Independents. I leave the Minister to consider that recommendation. In fairness to the Minister, he has given the matter very serious consideration. I look forward to the day when we have a Swedish model, nuanced to fit Irish law and best practice. As is the case with almost all Bills coming through the House, my party colleagues and I have several concerns. First, Ireland has yet to clarify what supports and assistance will be provided to victims after criminal proceedings have concluded, as the EU directive requires. We would like to see commitments in this regard which would outline types of support and timelines for their provision. We believe the Government should use this opportunity to outline how it plans to improve victim identification with a view to improving support for and protection of victims and to preparing witnesses for criminal prosecution. There is also an issue around the lack of safe accommodation for victims. The current direct provision accommodation for victims is controversial and widely regarded as inadequate and inappropriate. Experts in the area, such as the Immigrant Council of Ireland, tell us that the service provided is institutional in nature and, specifically, does not cater for the needs of different genders. It is questionable whether it meets the EU directive's requirement for appropriate and safe accommodation. It is unfortunate that Ireland has failed to outline any procedures for victims of trafficking with special needs, including those with disabilities, health issues, pregnancy or trauma from physical, mental and sexual abuse. The failure to identify such special needs is a matter of great concern and a shortcoming in the Bill. The State also fails to outline any measures to prevent secondary victimisation, by which people who are trafficked are forced to relive their ordeals by repeatedly giving accounts of their experiences. The Government needs to outline what measures and protocols will be taken to ensure victims do not have to recount their ordeals on numerous occasions, as required by the EU directive. Finally, I urge the Minister to consider strengthening the all-Ireland approach to the whole problem of trafficking. There is very good co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI. I had the opportunity last year to meet the Garda Assistant Commissioner, Kieran Kenny, who has specific responsibilities in this area, and was very impressed with him, his team, his approach and his reassurances. There is a strong relationship between the two forces, so let us strengthen that and ensure that the Garda and the PSNI work hand in glove to combat and prevent trafficking of people into the sex industry, bonded labour and forced labour, forced marriages, etc. In conclusion, this is a good Bill overall and we are happy to support its journey through the Houses, but I ask the Minister please to take into consideration some of the shortcomings I have pointed out. One of the concerns we will have, as we give resources to the police services on the island to combat human trafficking, is how we support the victims, whether in prostitution or in another sphere, so that they have support and sustenance and are not just left there. I am sure that will not be the case but I ask the Minister to consider those concerns. Overall, this is a good Bill."	spk_3

We in Sinn Féin will support the Bill, having supported the motion last week, because we know of the urgency of constructing a new prison in Cork. I had an opportunity, as a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, to visit the prison. While I commend the governor of the prison on his honesty and professionalism, as well as his team, they are all very open about the fact that conditions in the prison are unacceptable and are not in any way what they would desire. They also made a presentation to us that day on what was planned for the new Cork Prison. We had a chance to get a sense of the site and the challenges facing it. When one builds a new prison it is not always easy to find a location for it and I accept that there are challenges. At the initial presentation on this matter by the Minister at our committee and during the debate on the motion last week, I urged that the concerns of residents be listened to as much as possible in the construction phase. In the North of Ireland there have been a number of opportunities for Ministers to try to ensure as much as possible that local employment is provided in the construction phases of major projects.I ask the Government to bring the benefits to the people of the city, where possible. I am sure the jobs will be much needed. That is not the most important issue, however. The most important issue is to have a modern prison that reflects the vision for penal reform. The all-party report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality submitted a five point plan on decarceration to reduce prison numbers by one third in the next ten years. We investigated community service and restorative justice as alternatives to prison. I understand the Government will be introducing a fines (amendment) Bill later this year. That will be crucial to ending the practice whereby people go to prison for non-payment of fines. There are ways of gathering fines and holding people to account which do not entail putting people into prison.  One of the issues that were brought to our attention is that managing prisons can be frustrating for governors. They must do their best to meet the challenge of rehabilitation and maintaining morale while also dealing with a steady flow of prisoners through the doors of their prisons. A governor cannot turn away an individual who is sentenced to prison. The result is overcrowding and the practice of slopping out, which belongs to the Victorian era. We should provide for single cell occupancy in order that people who are sent to prison are not treated as if they are less than human. They are already being punished by dint of imprisonment and they may also be meeting their responsibility to society by participating in rehabilitation, training and reorienting their lives while they are in prison. The committee had an opportunity to travel to Helsinki for an intensive series of meetings with a range of experts from the justice committee of the Finnish Parliament, the parole board and leading lights of academia, as well as a visit to an open prison. When someone is sentenced to prison in Finland, an exit plan is developed for him or her. At present in Ireland, a prisoner can have 25% of his or her sentence remitted simply by keeping his or her head down. Remission is not linked to demonstrable rehabilitation. The committee's report argues that the period of remission should be increased to 33% as an incentive for prisoners to follow a clear path back into society. That is in the best interest of prisoners and, more important, of society. The issue of value for money also arises because it costs €65,000 per annum to keep a prisoner. That is a huge amount of money for taxpayers to spend. International best practice indicates that certain prisoners should not be held in shared cells, particularly those who are under protection or serving life sentences and, arguably, those who are recovering from drug addiction. We need to give individual prisoners the space they require for various reasons. A practical reality must also be borne in mind, however. If prisoners are sharing a cell overnight, the practical reality is that they will have to use the toilet in front of each other. That is not what we should want for our prison system because it undermines the dignity of those affected. The Irish Penal Reform Trust and Fr. Peter McVerry have criticised the plans for Cork. The prison will have 275 cells but only 30 are intended as single occupancy. The fact that only 10% of the accommodation in a brand new prison will be single occupancy is a missed opportunity given what we now know. I appreciate that we cannot provide single occupancy in every cell but in a context where 59 prisoners are currently under protection in Cork Prison, 30 single occupancy cells appear to be inadequate. Where was the consultation with the Irish Penal Reform Trust, the joint committee or prisoner advocacy groups? Are these plans simply the result of a group of architects and the prison authorities doing the best they could with the site? This is a missed opportunity. If in the future we implement a decarceration strategy to decrease prisoner numbers, many of the cells that are currently intended to be shared could become single occupancy but that would be by accident rather than design. Even at this late stage I urge the Government to take on board the legitimate concerns of those it regards as respected partners and consider amending its plans. My party is not going to vote against this Bill and we did not vote against the motion introduced last week even though we have concerns about the proposal. However, I ask the Government to investigate whether it can increase the number of single occupancy cells. I do not believe any prisoners should sleep overnight in shared cells. Nelson Mandela, who may leave this life very soon, famously said that to know how a country works, one should visit its prisons to see how those on the bottom rung are treated. Perhaps we should be inspired by his advice in getting the design of this prison right. How can we make it better than what is currently proposed? The refurbishment plans for Mountjoy Prison have had a big impact on single cell occupancy. The all-party recommendations of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality are progressive and address the need for somebody who commits a crime to pay his or debt to society. The committee does not take a soft-touch approach to justice. Restorative justice requires offenders to take responsibility and meeting one's victim face-to-face is not an easy way out. Community service is a way of repaying a debt to society by working for the community. These approaches are not soft on crime but they offer a means of rehabilitating offenders while also saving money for the taxpayer. The Government has our goodwill in respect of this project. I appreciate that it can pass the Bill without our co-operation and we support the Bill, albeit with serious reservations. I urge the Government to find a means of increasing the number of single occupancy cells in order to protect prisoners who are vulnerable or in need of rehabilitation. The prison authorities will know better than me the projected figures. The criticism of the Government's plans has been stinging. There is considerable disappointment with the design of the prison.I appreciate that time is of the essence. I know that things can be amended. It is not a huge task to look at various wings and restructure them. That is not a massive task in terms of what is coming down the line. We know the existing numbers in Cork. We hope fewer people will be sent to jail as a result of the changes being introduced in the fines (amendment) Bill. As the prison could be reconfigured, it is closer to our vision of what we want. We need to send a message by designing a prison that reflects our values and our vision for rehabilitation in 2013. I think we all know that what is on the table now is not up to standard. We need to sort it out.	spk_274

The Tánaiste will know well one of the main lines in that Proclamation, namely, cherishing all of the children of the nation equally. The decision yesterday announced by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the Minister, Deputy Quinn - he was nowhere to be seen yesterday; it is welcome that he is here today - flies in the face of that pledge. The latest cuts of 25% in real terms since 2011 are shameful. I cannot understand that because every parliamentarian in these Houses has interacted with parents, families and carers of people with disabilities. How can we continue to stand over cuts such as these? These are cuts to children with autism, speech and language difficulties, multiple disabilities, severe emotional disturbance and visual or hearing impairments. Why are children such as these and vulnerable people paying the price of austerity? People watching these debates know that the very wealthy got bailed out, and they take the hit. How can the Tánaiste possibly stand over this type of decision? Members of this House come from different political backgrounds but, fundamentally, we are decent people. We listen to people who are carers and those who are struggling. I appeal to the Minister to reverse this decision. He should not present it in some Orwellian fashion that the budget is the same as it was last year. He knows that the number of students has increased. More money needs to be allocated to this area.

All of us got e-mails last night from teachers and principals across the State describing clearly the real impact on the children involved in their schools.This is defending the indefensible. I will read from the Labour Party manifesto for the last election. It states, ""Labour will support schools, parents and children with special educational needs by ensuring that necessary supports follow a child from primary to second level and achieving greater integration of special needs-related services."" The Labour Party was spot on when it said that and it should honour that. I was on a panel sponsored by the Disability Federation of Ireland last year and it put out a pledge called ""a threshold of decency"" for every political party to subscribe to, stating there would be no more cuts to disability services. What citizen would support the cutting of services to children with disabilities, their parents or carers? That was the pledge and this Government has not accepted it. The Tánaiste should stop the Orwellian language and the nonsense. Let us be realistic, the fact is that children going to school in September will have to cope will less support for those pupils with disabilities. There was a presentation recently by parents of children with Down's syndrome. In Donegal Deputies from all parties recently met parents who told them what it means to be the parent of a disabled child and what those resources and supports mean to them. I am appealing to decency here because I think we are decent people in these Houses. Let us reverse this decision. Do not hide behind the NCSE but do the right thing and reverse the decision.

Every year we debate this, every year Sinn Féin opposes it and every year it passes. We all know the background to the Offences against the State Act and I will not rehearse it again today. Suffice to say I have no hesitation in renewing the call on those responsible for what happened at Omagh to cease their activities and to embrace the peace process. The events of that day were a direct attack on the peace process and the Sinn Féin strategy. It is a credit to all those involved in the peace process at the time that it survived and has since flourished. While there is a while go before we, as republicans, realise our ultimate goal of a united Ireland, we must continue to defend the peace process. Although full responsibility for the events of that day, 15 August 1998, lies with the so-called Real IRA, subsequent details have shown that less than perfect policing procedures, analysis and communication of intelligence were employed. Recently, I met the Omagh support group which continues to campaign for justice and I listened to their real concerns about that day. These people deserve to know the truth and I urge the Government to act on its pre-election promises and have a public North-South investigation into that fateful day. The Omagh bomb was of particular importance to me. Three children from my home town of Buncrana lost their lives and two of our friends from Spain who stay in the town every year as part of their English language learning development also lost their lives. Our community was devastated by that bomb. I and my party call on those responsible to take note of the progress made on this island since the passage of the Good Friday Agreement. They will not derail our peace process, they do not have the capacity to do so. I want to put on the record of this House that senior members of my party, the leadership, have repeatedly had their lives threatened by many of these individuals. Up until recent times, the leadership of my party was receiving warnings from the PSNI. This is a serious matter for us and we do not take it lightly. We have stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Sinn Féin, both leadership and membership, to confront these individuals to demonstrate clearly and to work day in and day out to defend the peace process. However, they do not warrant a strong argument for the retention of these measures. We live in a society where there is space for those with varying views to put forward those arguments and if they believe in the strength of their convictions, I ask that they debate them with the rest of society. The Good Friday Agreement was overwhelmingly and democratically endorsed by the vast majority of the Irish people. If the perpetrators believe in democracy at all, I ask that they cease their activities. The Minister has referred in the past to upholding and implementing in full the Good Friday Agreement because it is the democratic wish of the Irish people. There is an onus on us to do so and as part of this there is a responsibility to bring about as quickly as possible the normalisation of policing and justice on the island of Ireland. Our international commitments are not the only reason for us to oppose the motion. The Government has certain obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. The Agreement places an onus on both Governments to work towards the normalisation of the security apparatus in the Twenty-six Counties and the Six Counties. As the Minister stated, the agreement was endorsed overwhelmingly by the majority of people on this island. It needs to be protected and implemented in full. Therefore, the scrapping of the legislation before us for renewal is a pressing issue for all of us in these Houses. In the past, many Deputies have argued in favour of the provisions of the Act because they have played a role. Today, I do not think anyone can truthfully argue that these provisions have a place in the present or future of this State. Sinn Féin believes the legislation is counter-productive in the long run. The retention of these provisions is an admission of the failure of this and previous Governments. The challenge to us is to prove that we have a normal society and that normal policing will convict those who seek to undermine it. There is no place in society for the emergency legislation that was passed in 1998. Draconian legislation can never be a substitute for sound law and good and accountable policing. As Members in this Chamber will be aware, Sinn Féin has consistently opposed the retention of this amendment. We have argued each year that it should be repealed in its entirety. At this time, there is neither a need for such legislation nor an argument in favour of it. The continuation of it will only serve to erode further the human rights ethos in which the State's legislation should be grounded. If Deputies in this Chamber truly value the concepts of democracy and human rights, I implore them to vote accordingly and to reject the motion. We are a normal society and the existing laws are strong enough if properly resourced. Sinn Féin has been in a minority in this House in recent years when it has rightly opposed the 1998 Act. The chances are that we will be in a minority again today. We are not in a minority internationally, however, as we analyse this measure. The UN Human Rights Committee shares our stance on it. An Garda Síochána and the courts can convict those who carry out atrocious acts in this day and age and ensure they serve a proper sentence for those actions. We must make every attempt to convince so-called dissident groups to move away from violence and to get them to accept the will of the people as expressed in the Good Friday Agreement. We must also convince them of the opportunities that the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process give republicans to further the republican and all-island agenda, and that is where our focus for the next 12 months should be. I ask Members to vote against this measure. On the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, it is a sad reflection on any government or state when it has to admit that the ordinary courts are not adequate. If we are serious about dealing with organised criminal gangs, we need to put resources in place. For instance, we should not be closing rural Garda stations. This morning we discussed this. Not only did the Government close rural Garda stations, but it cut the number of Garda vehicles and the number of Garda personnel. If any Member of these Houses really wants to know the position, he or she should speak to gardaí on the ground who tell us that they have depleted resources and capacity to combat crime. The Minister will say that is just one aspect of the matter. If we are to be serious, we should ensure financial resources are invested in front-line manpower. If the recruitment embargo must be lifted to deal with organised criminal gangs, that should be done. I am sure those who are involved in organised criminal activity see the introduction of legislation to ensure they are tried before the Special Criminal Court as an admission of the State's failure to provide protections and safeguards to those who serve on juries. It is the wrong way to go. We will oppose this proposal for that reason. That is not to disregard flippantly the activities of these criminal gangs. We understand they cause misery and hardship and have no regard for law and order. If one examines best international practice, one will see that other countries have found more effective ways of dealing with organised criminal gangs that do not involve institutions like the Special Criminal Court. The Minister cannot argue for the retention of draconian legislation while he is responsible for implementing considerable cutbacks to An Garda Síochána and taking away its resources to combat criminality in our communities. There is a contradiction in the argument and for that reason, we will oppose both motions.	spk_161

It is a relic of that time and is no longer necessary. The United Nations and the EU are in place to deal with conflict resolution. I am not asking for the Minister's personal view, I am asking for the Government position. Does it stand over our long-held and proud tradition of active, participative neutrality, playing to our strengths, to protect human rights, help developing nations and, where necessary, to be involved in peacekeeping and conflict resolution?	spk_32

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-06-18	dail	31	Development of Cork Prison: Motion	dbsect_31	We had an opportunity to have an initial discussion on the motion at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality last week. As I pointed out then, I was part of the committee delegation that visited Cork Prison last year. The governor made it clear from the outset that the prison is not up to standard and does not comply with the requirements of a civilised society. When people are in prison, we want to rehabilitate them and have the environment that allows that to happen. On that basis, the new prison is welcome and the sooner it is built, the better. However, since last week's committee meeting there has been very strong criticism from the Irish Penal Reform Trust and individuals such as Fr. Peter McVerry about the proposal for shared cells. It is very welcome that slopping out will cease. At the moment almost all the cells in Cork Prison require slopping out, which is a very demeaning practice. However, the practical difficulties with shared cells are obviously that somebody has to use the toilet in front of another human being. If we are trying to rehabilitate prisoners and take them away from the life they had led to being fully equipped to act as a participating citizen, having to use a toilet in front of another person is a bad way to start. There are also issues with prisoners trying to come off drugs. Unfortunately, many people who have been imprisoned are addicted to drugs. A prisoner may be in a cell with another who is not coming off drugs. There are practical reasons and also reasons of dignity for moving away from multiple occupancy cells. Sinn Féin wants to support the motion but before wrapping up the debate, I want the Minister to give an assurance that he will do everything to look at those plans again and see if amendments can be made because we want to move forward. The redevelopment of Mountjoy Prison has been very welcome and it now has single occupancy cells. Already apparently the impact has been extremely positive. Our committee prepared the penal reform report which has been submitted to the Minister for consideration. It is an excellent report completed by our rapporteur, Senator Bacik, and agreed unanimously. It contains a vision for decarceration with a target of reducing prisoner numbers by a third.The report includes looking at community service, restorative justice and alternatives to imprisonment for people who are convicted of minor offences. Naturally, there is a need for people who are a threat to society and who are violent to continue to be imprisoned. We need to see a tailored plan for prisoners and to have an exit strategy for people when they are imprisoned that will take them through the process and that will ensure they are genuinely rehabilitated. We examined other issues. At the moment if a man is in prison and if he keeps his head down and does not engage in any real reform of himself as a person he will get 25% remission almost automatically. The sub-committee on penal reform has argued that there should be tangible rehabilitation on a tailor-made basis with a personal plan. In response the incentive could be one third remission for prisoners within the system. We want to see value for money. We are paying approximately €65,000 for every prisoner locked up each year. It is costing us a fortune and the long-term benefits are not evident. The five-point plan from the sub-committee, which was an all-party proposal given to the Minister, is a real template for progress. I urge the Minister in that spirit to examine the plans for the prison in Cork again. Let us move on as we mean to go along. We want to rehabilitate prisoners. In 2013, in what we hope is a civilised State, is it really appropriate that people have to use the toilet in front of others? It is altogether demeaning and totally unacceptable for what is a new prison being built here and now. I urge the Minister to address the concerns of the brilliant people who work in partnership with us, including Fr. Peter McVerry and those in the Irish Penal Reform Trust, who we all respect in the House as making a constructive contribution to penal reform the State. It is not about easy solutions for people who find themselves in crime. This is not about easy alternatives but hard ones. I recognise that the Minister is enthusiastic about restorative justice. When a person must stand in front of his victims and take ownership of what he has done and do the right thing and when a person has to do community service in his community for what are not serious crimes but crimes nonetheless, it is a case of painful and difficult choices, but they cost the taxpayer less and we get a better result. In the context of penal reform and of a new vision for how we run our criminal justice system and our prisons, let us progress on the right basis. I appeal to Minister to do everything he can to address the issue of double occupancy. The Minister should also reassure the NGOs with whom we are partners in this regard and he should do so today.	spk_209

The troika has said it is only interested in deficit reduction in the coming years, but how we get there is entirely in our hands. The Government makes choices. It chooses every time to let the very wealthy in this State and those from overseas who come to this State off the hook. They say to the highly paid every time to stay where they are because everything is hunky dory. That is the choice the Government has made. It has decided against all economic logic to take €500 million, mostly through cuts, from low to middle-income people who spend money in the economy. I do not think those on the Government side are stupid. They talk to businesses in their communities. They must see that the economy desperately needs a lift, stimulus, hope and positivity, yet they continue to take more. Where is the logic? There is a crazy situation whereby the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, gives speeches about an end to austerity and our President, Michael D. Higgins, goes to Europe and says things that are absolutely right, and those on the Government side all say he is absolutely right. What the hell are they at? One minute they tell us that we have to go through austerity, that we must have the household tax and that we cannot tax the wealthy because, God forbid, they would run a million miles if we ever asked them to pay their fair share, while on the other hand they talk about an end to austerity. It is almost like two different people or mindsets. When will we see an end to austerity? Then they come to us and talk about alternatives. We give the Government alternatives budget after budget, fully costed by the Department of Finance. What does the Government need? Some €365 million could be saved by implementing a third rate of tax on the highly paid. The Government could raise hundreds of millions from a wealth tax on the assets of the very wealthy who are here. It could raise hundreds of millions if it brought in standardised discretionary tax rates. I could go on and on. The Government makes choices. In the case of those in Fine Gael, it is no surprise. They always represented the big house and always looked after those in it. Now they have followed Fianna Fáil and sucked the hope out of our people again, but the people are waiting for them in the long grass.	spk_656

The Government will read out a list that will present the Minister as verging on a saint; the Opposition will argue a case that tries to present him in as bad a light as possible. I will say something that may surprise the Minister. For the record, I believe he is an immensely hardworking Minister and somebody of immense capability, with the potential to do great good in his portfolio in the time ahead. Of course he will win this vote of confidence tomorrow. However, I will outline to him substantial concerns my party has in regard to policing, the present and the historical relationship between his ministry and senior police in this State, and the need for change. I ask the Minister to hear our case, which is made to him in sincerity. We acknowledge his strengths but he also needs to hear the weaknesses. In terms of Garda morale, 140 stations will have closed across the State. The argument that has been made by the Minister and the Garda Commissioner is that it is all about efficiency, modernisation and smart policing. It is the way to go. The Minister has spoken about the 750 stations that existed in the time of the RIC and the fact that these police officers would have cycled around, and the need for modernity. The difficulty with his argument, however, is that he has reduced Garda numbers and presided over this reduction, by 10% in recent years from the previous Government until now. We see a net reduction of hundreds of Garda vehicles. Any Member of this House or the Seanad who talks to their local gardaí, from grass roots to senior level, will say they admit to us they are not happy with the changes, not because they are resisting change but because they see the impact in their communities.The Minister and his Government colleagues must know that morale is genuinely low. As recently as last week I spoke to a couple of gardaí in this city who shared with me their concerns about how these cutbacks will affect their ability to do policing. They are immensely impressive people who want to provide a service to this State, but we are failing them. For the first time in its 35 year history the GRA did not invite the Minister of the day to its conference. That is deeply worrying because nobody wins if front-line gardaí have such concerns about a Minister. I admit that the previous Minister, Dermot Ahern, had a similarly poor relationship, to the point that the former president of the GRA made a blistering speech which gave rise to considerable controversy. We need to deal with this issue. A couple of weeks ago the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission published a seven page summary of a 500 page report that it had submitted to the Minister. The report expressed grave concern that the lessons of the Morris tribunal, which was the reason the commission was established, had not been learned. It found that contemporaneous notes had not been maintained and expressed concern about the handling of informants. The commission clearly felt it did not have the co-operation it should have received in investigating the Kieran Boylan affair and the serious allegation that an individual convicted of drug dealing found in possession of €1.7 million of cocaine and heroine had his charges dropped without reasonable explanation. The commission carried out an investigation in the public interest and put its concerns in the public domain but the Garda Commissioner dismissed the report by saying he did not have sufficient time to consider it. Two weeks later we still do not know the Commissioner's response. The Minister has stated that he wants to pull both sides together to address the issue but the Government needs to clearly outline what it intends to do to address the commission's concerns. The penalty points debacle began when two honourable members of the Garda came across what they regarded as double standards in the administration of the law. They expressed their concerns to the appropriate Garda authority, that is, the confidential recipient, but nothing happened for months. They also raised the issue with the Comptroller and Auditor General in light of the financial implications and with the Road Safety Authority. I understand they also made contact with the Taoiseach, who passed their information on to the Minister, Deputy Shatter. These individuals were not hiding behind a cloak of anonymity; they were trying to change things for the good. However, the Minister chose to ask senior police to investigate senior police. That was the wrong decision. He should have requested the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to investigate the issue because of the concern that senior police will not have sufficient independence or separation from the individuals they are investigating. The Garda Commissioner and the Minister then chose to criticise the Garda whistleblowers instead of commending them and implied they were acting anonymously when their identities were in fact known. In raising the matter with the appropriate authorities and putting it into the public domain when they felt they were getting nowhere with the internal structure, these two brave men have done a service to the people of this State because we will now have a new penalty points system that is accountable and provides a paper trail. It is acceptable in certain circumstances to rescind penalty points as long as citizens clearly understand the reason. These individuals should have been commended instead of criticised. That was the wrong approach on the part of the Minister. The overwhelming majority of gardaí, from the bottom to the top, are people of the highest honour who want to serve this State. There is nothing to fear in making the system better and more accountable. The Government has indicated that it intends to introduce whistleblower legislation. I remind the Minister that we got into this crisis because too many people in the private and public sectors failed to blow the whistle or shout stop. For whatever reason, they did not speak out about what they knew to be wrong. We now want to create an environment in which people can feel comfortable speaking out. What encouragement will those who want to speak out get from this debacle? One of the aforementioned whistleblowers has had to resign from the force and I am sure the other one is seriously considering his position. That is in nobody's interest. The matter was badly handled in a way that goes against stated Government policy. In regard to the Deputy Wallace affair, I think the Minister looks back on that moment and wonders why he chose to make his comments. It was wrong but it was not new. For too long the relationship between senior gardaí and the Ministers of the day was unhealthy. They were almost interdependent. The history extends back to the Seán Doherty affair, the Michael McDowell business and the issues arising for Deputy O'Dea. This unhealthy relationship needs to change. Our amendment to the motion calls for an independent police authority, a proposal which Fine Gael used to support. The authority would have independence in its budget and affairs, and would be insulated from political interference. As an independent policing authority, the Garda should be fully accountable to the Oireachtas and joint policing committees. Gardaí would also be required to co-operate fully with the ombudsman and the Garda Síochána Inspectorate. We need a new beginning to policing and the relationship between senior gardaí and Ministers. The information on Deputy Wallace came into the Minister's possession but he was wrong to use it. It was a huge error of judgment on the part of the Minister. In regard to the issues raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath, the Minister put his own version of what happened at that checkpoint into the public domain and repeated it in the House tonight. He may be entirely correct in his assessment but there are different presentations of what happened that night. The only people who can shed light on the matter are the gardaí who were on duty. While the Garda Commissioner has indicated that no record exists of the incident, there must be a record of the checkpoint itself because a checkpoint with a mandatory breathalyser test can only be sanctioned by somebody at the level of inspector or higher. The record of the checkpoint would set out the number of tests administered and their outcome, when they took place and who was on duty. That information would be passed onto the local superintendent and to Garda headquarters. We call on the Garda Commissioner to speak to the gardaí who were on duty that night to confirm or contest the Minister's version of events in order to put the issue to bed. Checkpoints and stoppages are not the central issue in this affair. It is more important that the public have faith in the Garda and its accountability. The Morris tribunal found that a small minority of gardaí in my county of Donegal behaved reprehensibly and abused their power. We were supposed to have learned lessons from that tribunal. We subsequently established the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Síochána Inspectorate and the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to move us in the right direction. Let us take the next step by establishing an independent policing authority which would be completely free from political interference while remaining fully accountable to these Houses.  I have been marking the Minister from the Opposition benches and have seen many things that impressed me. I do not dispute his immense capacity or desire to introduce reform and improve matters.He has waited most of his life to become Minister for Justice and Equality and I am sure he wishes to complete his term of office. If he survives this period, I ask him to learn lessons from recent events. If he manages to remain Minister for Justice and Equality for the duration of the Government, I ask him to introduce the reforms that are necessary. He should also allow the allegations by Garda whistleblowers concerning penalty points to be examined independently by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. There is nothing to fear from having a spotlight shone on this issue. There are two certainties with regard to the Garda Síochána. First, morale among the men and women of the force is at an all-time low. Whether the Minister accepts, agrees or understands this, gardaí feel demoralised as a result of the recent plethora of cutbacks and the impact they are having. This is an important issue which must be addressed through engagement and by winning hearts and minds. This will require the reversal of some of the cutbacks the Government has made. The second certainty is that we must restore public confidence in how policing is carried out at senior levels and the manner in which it relates to the Department of Justice and Equality. Those are the two challenges facing the Minister. The Minister will survive the vote of confidence tomorrow night as the Opposition will vote virtually	spk_563

The Minister indicated on Second Stage and on Committee Stage that he intended to bring forward significant amendments and that he may have to change the name of the Bill to facilitate the amendments. I recall the debate on Second Stage took place soon after the bomb attacks in Boston that availed of mobile telephone communication. There is genuine concern and these matters evolve as time moves on. If the Minister is saying the security and intelligence services in the State, working in co-operation with the PSNI in the North, has solid intelligence of a real threat, then citizens will accept that, under strong conditions, it is necessary to shut down a mobile telephone network to prevent the threat. We will monitor this closely because we have concerns about how intelligence services conduct their business. If there is a real threat to people's lives and this is a means to prevent it, that is fine. The intent is fine but our difficulty is that it is a haphazard way to deal with legislation. The debate on Second Stage took place weeks ago, following the attacks in Boston. I understand it is linked to the G8 event in Fermanagh and the need for an all-Ireland synchronisation of the intelligence and security response. The legislation we are dealing with deals with money laundering and criminality and the support measures to tackle criminal gangs, which I will deal with at length. The Minister has an acceptable intent to put in place measures to protect people's lives in the State from a real threat that has been proven in recent times. Why can the Government not do this in terms of other issues that impact on our international responsibilities, such as the revelation yesterday in the US Senate committee about Apple? Apple may not be the biggest avoiders but the issue is that it says it pays less than 2% tax-----	spk_166

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-05-22	dail	31	Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2013: Instruction to Committee	dbsect_6	The Minister and the Government have chosen to change the name of the Bill and change the direction of what it is about for a specified purpose that complies with their international security responsibilities. We also have responsibilities to the international community in terms of business and attracting business. That is the link point I am making. Where is the radical intervention through an existing Bill to make something happen and to change our laws to comply with our international responsibilities? We have been criticised by the US Senate and the public accounts committee in Westminster. Why can we not do it in respect of these matters? The other point linked to the specifics of the Bill we should be discussing today is the report from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists about white collar crime and tax avoidance. The Government has been aware of this for quite a while. Citizens in Ireland are avoiding their tax responsibilities with offshore accounts. This is a global approach where people in the professions, such as accountancy and law, assist this. It is estimated that between €16 trillion and €25 trillion is hidden in offshore accounts. Many Irish citizens are involved in the business. Where is the dramatic intervention in the process of legislation changing a Bill to make it happen and deal with the issue? I refer to the Ansbacher debacle. No one was prosecuted. We are discussing money laundering, criminality, criminal gangs and their impact on our economy, and white collar crime and its impact. Tax avoidance is stealing from our State. The Government is choosing to ask people to pay the family home tax to raise €500 million per annum. How many hundreds of millions of euro have been lost through legalised tax avoidance by major corporations and white collar crime? I do not see the Government coming in with emergency interventions in legislation to make it happen yet the Government is doing it here. That is our point. There seems to be a selective approach to haphazard legislation when it suits but in other cases it cannot happen because it will be delayed in the Office of the Attorney General and the process will go on until we have a solution. With regard to the specifics of the Bill we were dealing with, the Exchequer is losing €861 million annually because of illegal black market activity and theft. Sinn Féin supports the original Bill, which brings Ireland into line with international norms on tackling these issues. Retail Excellence Ireland made an excellent presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on cigarette smuggling and the practical solutions proposed, such as scanning containers. Retail Excellence Ireland offered to resource some of the cost of handheld devices that can be used in markets to see if illegal cigarettes are being sold. The impact is profound because we know the cost of smoking to health services. We know the lost revenue from cigarette smuggling and the Government should do everything it can to co-operate to tackle criminal gangs in terms of diesel laundering and cigarette smuggling. We must protect citizens but the issue I have is that when it comes to major corporations and white collar criminals in the State, there is not the same urgency to amend legislation. That is our fundamental objection to the motion. This seems to be a selective approach. Who could not agree with the need to shut down a mobile telephone network for a period of time to protect citizens?	spk_170

The amendments being introduced by the Minister required a motion so Members could speak on them. It is a very significant set of amendments that changes the name of the Bill and requires a motion.

In conclusion, the issue the Minister has brought forward is one that I accept must be addressed by the Government. That is fair enough. My only objection is the process the Minister has chosen. If he is saying this is a necessary intervention he must make, and he did raise it on Second and Committee Stages, I ask him to also consider that approach and to accept representations from the Opposition for other matters of importance that require us to meet our international obligations.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-05-21	dail	31	Issuing of fixed ticket charges and exercise of Garda discretion: Statements	dbsect_19	"What has been evidenced in the past week is an unhealthy relationship or partnership between the Minister and the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan. The Commissioner is standing over and supporting the Minister in the face of the closure of 140 Garda stations and the failure to replace thousands of retired gardaí and hundreds of Garda vehicles whose period of service has expired. Garda morale is at an all-time low. The Minister knows that gardaí on the front line have spoken up against these issues. They have spoken to Members of both Houses about their concerns. The Commissioner has stood by the Minister and has talked about efficiency, modernisation and smart policing. Such is the anger among the ranks of An Garda Síochána that, for the first time in 35 years, gardaí did not invite the Minister to attend their conference. There were walk-outs at the AGSI conference. This demonstrates the anger on the ground. Despite this, the Garda Commissioner stands solidly behind the Minister in defending the cutbacks that are having an effect across the board. In the past week, there were three serious moments that are very worrying for every citizen. The first concerns the Garda ombudsman's report, the public-interest investigation into what is known as the Kieran Boylan affair. A convicted drug dealer, alleged to have been in possession of heroin and cocaine worth €1.7 million, he had charges dropped against him without any clear explanation. He also benefited from a haulier licence after his conviction. The relationship of Mr. Boylan with some within An Garda Síochána at quite a high level is a serious matter. The ombudsman, having completed four years in office, has reported to the public in a remarkable summary of the full report. The ombudsman has grave concerns about the level of co-operation from An Garda Síochána. The report refers to the Morris tribunal and states lessons have not been learned. The report refers to the failure to keep contemporaneous notes of issues surrounding the handling of informers, which issues were so central to all the crises associated with the tribunal. Very serious matters were raised, including the failure to co-operate continually. Only 17 of 62 requests for information were returned within the 30-day period. The Minister had nothing to say about that other than that he will pull the Garda Commissioner together with the ombudsman. We know that sources within An Garda Síochána briefed against the ombudsman's office on the weekend in question in the media, unchallenged by the Minister. He let the matter continue and issued no comment since. Next was the penalty points debacle. Two Garda whistleblowers came across what they believed to be considerable malpractice in regard to the rescinding of penalty points that have been issued. They tried to raise those concerns through the appropriate Garda channel, the confidential receiver. They did not seem to get anywhere with that. I understand they brought the matter to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Road Safety Authority, and that they tried to make contact with the Taoiseach repeatedly. Having make all these attempts, they then took their concerns to Members of the Oireachtas, as was their right because they felt the matters of serious concern were not dealt with. The Minister chose to ask senior police to investigate senior police rather than ask the ombudsman to carry out an independent examination of the serious matters in question. Was there a paper trail behind every single penalty point that was rescinded? If somebody said he was in a medical emergency and that points should not be issued, as was his right, there should be backup documentation to prove there was indeed a medical emergency. Where is the paper trail behind all the hundreds and thousands of penalty points that were rescinded? How can the motorist be sure the law applies as much to him as everyone else? These were the matters that very courageous whistleblowers put into the public domain. On the day on which the report was published, the Minister chose to go on the offensive against them. This State was brought to the edge of economic crisis because too many people in the public and private sectors failed to blow the whistle and shout ""Stop"". The Government is preparing whistleblower legislation. What encouragement will whistleblowers receive from the Minister's attacks on the two courageous gardaí? One of the gardaí said he has been driven out of the force because of the choices he made. At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Garda Commissioner spoke about hiding behind a cloak of anonymity. He must know the whistleblowers’ identities, however, because they went through the appropriate authorities. We have had the Garda ombudsman's report and the penalty points debacle in which the Minister chose to shoot the messenger, the whistleblowers, rather than shed more light on these issues. Next was the Deputy Mick Wallace debacle on “Prime Time”. We now know the Minister was briefed by the Garda Commissioner on these matters. Under what remit was he operating? Was there a legal requirement? What was the legal basis? Could the Minister refer to the legal basis, under sections 41 and 62 of the Garda Síochána Act, in respect of which the Commissioner would have given him the information? How did the information make its way from the two gardaí, who did not charge the Deputy but who instead gave him a brief slap on the wrist, to the Garda Commissioner without its being filed within the system? Why did the Commissioner feel it was essential to give the Minister that information? Was the timing not fortuitous? When did the Minister receive the briefing from the Garda Commissioner? Let me read to the Minister his press release some years ago on the then Minister, Deputy Willie O’Dea, who had to resign: ""It must be presumed that any such information, when furnished by a member of the Gardaí, to a Government Minister would be expected to be kept confidential and disclosed to no other persons, other than to members of Cabinet within the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions, where the information is sufficiently serious to require such discussion."" The Minister continued:Such conduct is entirely unacceptable by any minister in any Government. Such conduct by a Minister for Defence, part of whose constitutional duty is to secure the security of the State, renders the Minister unfit for Cabinet office.Deputy Shatter is the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Defence. He has a unique array of powers that very few, if any, Ministers have in the developed world. With these powers comes access to some of the most sensitive information. We expect the Minister to use that wisely. For the life of me, I cannot understand how a man such as the Minister, who has undoubted intellectual and legal capacity and who is not just an ordinary legal practitioner but one of great repute, felt it would be acceptable to make the intervention he made in the debate in question. I cannot figure it out. The Minister was entirely wrong.  What was the legal basis for the information provided to the Minister? When the Minister was on ""Prime Time"", he did not name the exact date, time and location of the incident in question. How is it that a journalist got hold of that information after the ""Prime Time"" debate and was able to contact Deputy Wallace with specific details on where he was stopped? How did that information come to be in the hands of a journalist such that those questions could be asked?Who in An Garda Síochána felt it necessary to get that information to a journalist to assist the Minister? Does he not find that strange? I certainly do. I would like to get his thoughts on that. A very unhealthy relationship is developing. It is a disservice to the overwhelming majority of members of An Garda Síochána who have very low morale as a result of cutbacks and all of the challenges they have faced. They need to be assured that those at the very top of An Garda Síochána answer questions and deal with them effectively, and that the Minister of the day holds them to account, deals with issues of legitimate concern and does not let them down."	spk_222

Transparency International Ireland last night put out a statement detailing the treatment of these whistleblowers, who are courageous men who have been isolated and put aside. One of them had to leave the force because of these allegations. As the Tánaiste knows, Garda morale is on the floor. Some 140 Garda stations have closed in recent times and thousands of gardaí have retired and not been replaced. Hundreds of Garda vehicles have been removed. For the first time in the 35-year history of the Garda Representative Association, GRA, it did not invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to its conference. That is the environment we are in. Nevertheless, when two gardaí who love what they do and who believe in fairness, justice and consistency of the law step up to the plate and raise issues of concern, they are brushed aside, criticised and isolated. What will the Government do to reassure the men and women listening today and over recent days who are working in the public and private sector and who are considering speaking out about concerns they have?

This week the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission published a seven page summary into the public interest investigation into the Garda and expressed concern that the recommendations of the Morris tribunal on the handling of informers, and very serious issues arose at the time, have not been implemented by the Garda Síochána. Senior gardaí were challenged on this and on not co-operating fully. In only 17 of 62 information requests was the information received within 30 days. When these issues were brought to the attention of senior gardaí and the Tánaiste's colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, they chose to batten down the hatches rather than let in the light. Will the Tánaiste allow an independent examination of the allegations? Will he allow someone to speak independently to the two Garda whistleblowers, look through the documentation and examine the issue independently so we can reassure the public that the concerns of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, about which I spoke last week, and the concerns of the two Garda whistleblowers are dealt with so the overwhelming majority of gardaí, who give so much for us every day and who are struggling with huge wage cuts and reductions in resources, can go out with their heads held high and not be let down by the failure of their senior colleagues to open the windows and let in the light?	spk_52

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-05-15	dail	31	Good Friday Agreement: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_30	"When the Good Friday Agreement was signed, I was in my mid-20s. I grew up in a republican family during the conflict and my father was imprisoned for nine years. Like thousands of others who had similar experiences, it was unbelievable to watch television coverage of the negotiations. I recall seeing images of the various negotiators standing in the windows of different rooms in the early hours of the morning. I also recall the drama and the immense achievement of Senator George Mitchell in bringing everybody over the line in the context of finalising the Agreement, which was then overwhelmingly endorsed by the majority of Irish people on both sides of the Border. That was a moment of great hope. It has been a rocky road since but the institutions are up and running, power-sharing is in place, there has been a new beginning in respect of policing and - despite the activities of a tiny minority of individuals who have no support whatsoever - there is peace in the main. However, that is not enough because it is not what was agreed. The outstanding issues include the failure to introduce a Bill of Rights for the North and an all-Ireland charter of rights, the failure to act on the Weston Park commitment to hold an independent inquiry into the killing of human rights lawyer Pat Finucane and the fact that Marian Price and Martin Corey remain in prison. Whose interest does it serve to imprison people without either trial or access to due process? All this does is to drive some young people into the arms of so-called dissident republican organisations. That is the only eventuality to which the ongoing imprisonment of Marian Price and Martin Corey - without any charges being proffered against them and without their having access to due process - gives rise. I cannot understand why the British Government is adhering to its approach in this regard. The complacency in respect of this matter is unacceptable. Consider how long it took to arrive at the Good Friday Agreement. If the true potential of the Agreement is to be achieved, then both the Irish and British Governments need to reconsider their attitude. The Irish Government must engage in renewed substantive engagement with its British counterpart in order to progress outstanding issues, including the establishment of a Bill of Rights for the North, an all-Ireland charter of rights and other legislative commitments. Sinn Féin wants a strong, inclusive and effective Bill of Rights to be introduced. This instrument must be capable of helping us move away from a society in which fundamental human rights were systematically trampled upon to one in which they are thoroughly, extensively and enduringly protected and promoted. Fifteen years on from the signing of the Agreement, my party maintains that a meaningful process should be put in place to implement a Bill of Rights that is worthy of the aspiration of all the people regarding a rights-based society which offers protection to the most vulnerable and which respects the diversity of our communities. Equality must be at its very core. The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which is chaired by Deputy McHugh, recently heard from representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Consortium about the failure of the Irish and British Governments to implement the key human rights obligations contained in the Agreement. It is 15 years since the Agreement, which was democratically endorsed by the vast majority of the people on this island who voted for a Bill of Rights for the North and an all-Ireland charter of rights, was signed but we are no further along the road. Despite the democratic demand on the part of the people, both Governments have failed to meet this obligation and that continues to undermine the agreement. A Bill of Rights for the North would be an opportunity to establish fundamental rights for all in our society. Who does not want that? What reason could anyone have for delaying the introduction of a Bill of Rights? Who does not believe in equality? Difficulties with regard to equality were core to the conflict in the first instance and were at the heart of the profound tragedy of 30 years of pain and hurt among people in republication and Nationalist areas, in Britain and across this entire island. It is sometimes for parties in this House which do not have representation in the North to use this matter as an opportunity to score points and to offer often the most bizarre arguments against Sinn Féin. I appeal to the political parties which support the Good Friday Agreement and which contributed - in some cases significantly - to its development to reflect on the level of engagement which is taking place. The Minister for Justice and Equality used the term ""in another jurisdiction"". The Irish Government is a co-signatory to the Good Friday Agreement. It is, therefore, a co-guarantor and it has every right to have a view in respect of and have a say on what happens in the Six Counties. It does not need to apologise for that or to refer to ""another jurisdiction"". Those in government will skilfully, diplomatically and respectfully engage with all parties but there is also a need for frank discussion, particularly as the Agreement is not being honoured in full. We know where complacency led us in the past and we cannot afford to go down that path again."	spk_581

Fascism did not just emerge with Hitler’s rise to power. It was already evident in Mussolini’s Italy and later in Franco’s Spain.Many men from this country who went to fight fascism in Spain were excommunicated from the Catholic Church. They were condemned up and down the country and isolated on their return. Many of them never returned home. If we are to look back and address those who took the decision to confront Nazism and fascism, we must do it in the round. We welcome this legislation. The men who served in the Allied forces suffered egregiously when they returned home, as did their families, for many years. The passing of this legislation is the right thing to do, but I ask the Government to also consider what it can do to heal the wounds of the men and women who left this country to fight fascism in Spain and with the 5th International Brigade who received no real acknowledgement from the State of the unbelievable courage they showed at the time.	spk_182

As Deputy Niall Collins has noted, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has been examining this issue and has invited a variety of spokespersons for national organisations, academics and former prostitutes to share the views and experiences of those who want to change our law to adopt the Swedish model and those who oppose such a change. We have heard hours of testimony, questions and examinations. At the recent Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis, my party overwhelmingly endorsed the Turn Off the Red Light campaign. The campaign is supported by more than 60 organisations across the State, including most trade unions, women's groups, domestic violence support groups, immigrant groups, farming organisations, young people's organisations and organisations that support children. This is the context in which Deputy Pringle has brought the Bill before us. We need to change the law because the current system is simply not working. I was moved by the testimony given to the joint committee on the reality of prostitution. The vast majority of those who find themselves in prostitution, most of whom are women, never wanted to become prostitutes. It was not their childhood ambition or the ambition of their families that they would become available for purchase by men they do not know or love and with whom they do not have any affinity, other than through an economic transaction. Prostitution does not involve equal interaction because the purchaser is the dominant economic party. The industry is a tragedy and if I hear it described one more time as the oldest profession, I will scream. Prostitution is an insult to everything for which Irish people stand and to the Proclamation to which Members pay allegiance every time we enter this building. It could not be further away from the principle of equality.  It makes me very angry to hear terms such as ""sex workers"" used by those who argue for maintaining prostitution, many of whom receive funding from the industry for online forums, websites and agencies. As the spokespersons of the trade union movement stated during the hearings of the joint committee - I recall in particular the contribution of Mr. Liam Doran of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation - prostitution is not work and has no connection with the workers' rights for which we fought. We want to support the women and small number of men involved in prostitution, those who moved to Ireland from abroad, were trafficked here or found themselves addicted to drugs or in economic hardship, by offering them a means to exit the industry. It is not good enough to change the legislation and give the Garda a new set of guidelines. We must provide meaningful supports to the women involved.  I listened recently to a report on ""Today with Pat Kenny"" in which Paddy O'Gorman, one of the reporters with the programme, spoke to some of the women who are affected by prostitution. I was deeply moved by the story of one woman, a drug addict, and the stark reality of what her life entails. Her life is a human tragedy which began in her teenage years in foster care when she experienced abuse and subsequently found herself on the streets of Dublin as a result of drug abuse. It is scandalous that some men believe it is acceptable to drive to Dublin from different parts of Ireland to purchase the services of the woman in question. We must confront and put an end to this scandal.  I received an e-mail this morning from a person lobbying on the legislation who used the term ""adult entertainment business"" to describe prostitution. The industry in Ireland, in which approximately 1,000 women are involved, is a modern form of slavery. We need to confront this issue by saying ""No"" and ""Stop"" to those who insist on using this language.  I had the opportunity of visiting Stockholm with a delegation from the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to study how the Swedish law on prostitution came about and the way in which it operates. We spent a full day in meetings with legislators, including members of the Swedish parliamentary committee on justice, officials from the Department of Justice, police and prosecution service and social workers. While there is no panacea for prostitution and the Swedish legislation is not perfect, it is the best model I can imagine. I was particularly moved by our encounter with a social worker who travels with the vice squad when it arrests some of those, primarily men, who avail of prostitution. I was very impressed with the support she provides. We asked her difficult questions, including whether the Swedish law will drive prostitution further underground. She and many others pointed out that prostitution, by its nature, requires people to offer themselves for sale, whether on the streets or websites. The argument that it will be driven underground is, therefore, nonsensical. When I asked how the women engaged in prostitution felt about the law she indicated that the overwhelming majority of the hundreds of women she dealt with were pleased to be offered a route out of a life of prostitution and welcomed the supports she provides. She was a highly impressive and remarkable woman, working at the heart of an impressive and remarkable law. I hope a similar law will be quickly introduced in this State in order that our legislation comes to reflect the promise of the Proclamation that hangs in the Lobby. Prostitution and trafficking have been dramatically reduced in Sweden since the new legislation was introduced. While women are still involved in prostitution and the model is not perfect, it is a hell of a lot better than the model in place in this country. Moreover, it reflects the values of the Swedish population much more than the  While the opponents of Deputy Pringle's Bill will never say so aloud, their objective is to completely decriminalise prostitution and allow prostitutes to work where they like. I point them to Amsterdam, the best example of a European city where prostitution has been fully liberalised, which is a disaster. To see women lined up in windows is an affront to all the values we claim to hold dear. Where does equality enter the picture in the red light district of Amsterdam? The Dutch are a fine people but their law on prostitution lets down their country and everything they stand for, which is a shame. The Swedish law is the model we should adopt.  Members of the Garda Síochána informed the joint committee that organised crime is behind prostitution. A legal loophole has allowed an English based website to offer hundreds of women for sale in Ireland. The site was set up by a convicted pimp whose son is also a pimp who was convicted in this city. These are the kind of people who make millions in profit off the backs of women available for sale in Ireland. The individuals in question also support an online campaign that seeks to prevent people such as me, Deputies Thomas Pringle and Niall Collins, and many others from doing what is right. They organise online attacks on individuals such as Sister Stanislaus Kennedy. They have also claimed the Turn Off the Red Light campaign is run by the religious and compare it to the Magdalen laundries. Pimps are funding campaigns to prevent us from doing the right thing. As legislators, we can choose the side of English based pimps or align ourselves with all the women's groups, Macra na Feirme, Barnardos and the rape crisis centres. I know where I stand. We need to do the right thing by the women who find themselves in these tragic circumstances by offering them supports, housing and genuine equality. They must be helped to get off drugs and find their place in society again. We must tell the small minority of men who purchase the services of women that they have no right do so. If they wish, as Irish men, to stand by the Proclamation and claim the rights of citizenship of this Republic, they do not have any right to use their economic position to pay for the services of a woman. They should be men and do what is right by refusing to avail of prostitution. I long to see the day that we have a law that does justice to what we claim to stand for. I commend Deputy Thomas Pringle on introducing this legislation, which I fully support."	spk_6

I am not convinced that the Government grasps just how dire the situation is for tens of thousands of households across the State. As I speak, almost one in four households is in mortgage distress. That is more than 180,000 households, which is a huge number. It is important to remember that this is not just a number or a statistic. These are real people, most with real families to take care of. That means hundreds of thousands of citizens - men, women and children - feel the impact of mortgage distress. Since the Government came to power, the number in arrears has almost doubled, just like it did in the last 18 months of Fianna Fail’s tenure. As we witness an increasing number of people fall into mortgage arrears, we also witness a change in the demographics of those who are in mortgage arrears. We are seeing people from all walks of life struggling to keep up with their mortgage repayments, not just those at the very bottom of the ladder. It is not just younger people who bought during the boom. We are now seeing more middle-aged and elderly people in mortgage distress. A report by the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, published just two weeks ago found that clients in mortgage difficulty are primarily households with children, located in urban areas and headed up by people between the ages of 45 and 65. These are all families who put their faith in politicians, economists and the great and the good. Let us not forget the newspapers, radios and TV channels with their property supplements and programmes which fed the message that we all needed to get our foot on that ladder and to do it now before prices increased further. That was the environment and the culture that fed this mess we now have to untangle as a people. I listened to reports from the Garda Representative Association’s annual conference yesterday and the stories of many rank and file gardaí who are no longer able to pay their mortgages. The people who are at the front line of protecting the citizens of this State can in some instances no longer pay their mortgages. That is what Ireland has become in 2013. It is a shame the Minister was not present to hear the stories. I hope the relationship will build again in the near future. One could ask what we do to resolve the situation. Let us examine the action that has been taken. We look after the banks, yet again, and make it easier for them to repossess family homes. We are now, as a modern society, putting people out of their family homes in order to help the banks, as if we had not done enough for the banks. The Fine Gael and Labour Government is turning its back on people, while supporting bankers at State-supported banks to pay themselves grotesque salaries. Before I speak to the details of the legislation, it is important to put it in the context of the soon-to-be up and running Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI. My party and I have a number of problems with the system. First is the bank veto, which means that people who are struggling with high debts are effectively barred from entering the insolvency process if their bank, which accounts for most of people's debts, disapproves of it. With so many people struggling under the weight of unsustainable mortgage debt, there is an onus on us to come up with a response to the crisis which does not put banks in control. It is not the right response for banks to be in control and to have a veto. Remarkably, in today’s Ireland the banks still rule. We paid the price to bail them out and yet they are just not stepping up to the mark to resolve the crisis, one they had more than a hand in creating. Sinn Féin has called for an independent body that would force banks to accept reasonable arrangements on a case-by-case basis. That could include write-downs in some instances. It is important to remember that write-downs must be part of the solution in some cases. We also have concerns about the role of personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs. There are genuine concerns that the private sector route that has been chosen will mean that many personal insolvency practitioners will cherry-pick cases with greater opportunities to make money, which means that those who are in the greatest need will not be able to get access to a PIP. Sinn Féin has long advocated for a public insolvency service. I fail to understand why the Minister did not consider making MABS the practitioners, and resourcing it accordingly. It has respected mediators of long standing and it has contacts throughout the State. The service would be well placed to deal with the issue. I wish to reiterate a point that has been made many times previously. The rushing of the personal insolvency legislation through both of these Houses with inadequate time for a more thorough examination of the Bill was wrong. Given the scale of the crisis, the fact that it is getting worse, and the major flaws in the personal insolvency system, now is not the time to make it easier for the banks to evict people from their homes. The biggest problem with the Bill before us is that it will result in an increased number of people being put out of their family homes. However, that is not the only thing that this legislation will do. It is important to bear in mind all that goes with the family home being repossessed. I refer to the stress, strain and anxiety it places on people, relationships, the impact on children who live in such homes and the huge negative effect on families. That cannot and should not be underestimated. The Bill has the potential to break up families and to ruin people’s lives. Another important point relates to the large number of mortgages which are with sub-prime lenders who are no longer operating in the State. Certain banks, such as Bank of Scotland, have left this country and just want to cash in. There is no incentive and nothing in the Bill that would force them to make sustainable arrangements. Section 2 of the Bill allows the court, either by its own motion, or on application by a relevant person, to adjourn repossession proceedings for a maximum period of two months to allow for the consideration of the making of a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement.What will this mean in reality? Why two months? Why not four or six months, to give real time for people to put in place a plan B? Two months is no consolation to someone who is about to lose his or her home and may eventually do so. Sinn Féin will continue to argue that a different approach is needed. We would make protection of the family home the priority and establish an independent body to force banks into pursuing reasonable arrangements. Sinn Féin is opposed to this Bill as it stands and will not be voting for it. One thing we can agree on is that relying on a loophole in the law is never a good way to do business. However, in the current crisis, this loophole has been a relief for many. My party agrees, as do I, that a loophole in the law is not acceptable moving forward, but until such time as the necessary safeguards are put in place, we should not close it. As long as the banks have the final say, as per the Personal Insolvency Act, and as long as this Government does not force the banks to deal reasonably with people who are doing their best to pay their mortgage, then we will not support this Bill which will make it easier for banks to repossess the family home. We are particularly concerned about the bank veto and the fact that there is no incentive to engage with the personal insolvency process in a fair and reasonable manner prior to seeking repossession. We believe that the code of conduct is skewed against the mortgage holder and that there are insufficient protections for families who are in the most distress. We are also concerned about the fact that there is not sufficient scope in this Bill for judges to assess whether the banks are being reasonable in their assessment of cases. I intend to table amendments on a number of these issues, to be discussed on Committee Stage in what I hope will be a reasonable manner. I want to amend this Bill to make it a solution and not part of the problem.	spk_315

It is a sneaky rise when the ECB is likely to cut interest rates next week. It is even more galling for home owners when they followed the proceedings yesterday where Richie Boucher was awarded a remuneration package of €843,000. Where is the Labour Party in all of this? A few years ago the policy of the Tánaiste's party was that the cap for bankers' pay should be €250,000 in line with the then Minister for Finance's income. A number of his backbenchers made a big stand about that this week and confronted this issue vigorously. It seemed at one point that he was going to make a stand once and for all on these issues but then, interestingly, yesterday the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who is seated behind the Tánaiste, confirmed to all of us that this was not the Minister, Deputy Noonan's decision, Fine Gael's decision but was a Government decision. Can the Tánaiste confirm that he signed off on that decision at the Economic Management Council in Cabinet? Was the Labour Party in full agreement with this decision?

We must all continue to work hard to ensure it is made increasingly tough for those involved in criminality to channel their money in a way that allows them to live a lifestyle repugnant to any sense of justice. For too long, many of our communities have faced the scourge of organised criminality and criminal gangs. Over the years we have had instances where governments have been slow to tackle this and unwittingly allowed criminals to operate all too easily. Dublin in the 1980s was in the throes of a massive drug epidemic. Limerick became a city people were afraid even to visit because it was referred to so often as ""stab city"", a massive disservice to the wonderful and resilient people of the city. The gangland killings on the streets of Dublin continue. Sinn Féin has repeatedly criticised the failure of successive Twenty-six Counties Governments to seriously tackle the causes of organised crime across the State. Substantial cuts to front-line services, both statutory and community, in the most disadvantaged and vulnerable communities across this State can only benefit these criminal gangs. Also, cutting Garda numbers by 10% can only benefit these gangs. The previous Government and the existing Government have operated and are operating, respectively, a policy of removing resources from gardaí to the point that we may fall below the unacceptable threshold of 13,000 in numbers. I noted the Minister's comments that the Croke Park II agreement vote will cause a delay in recruitment, but I appeal to the Minister and the Government to resolve this as soon as possible. Often much of the criminality narrative and reporting has centred on drugs, but this is not the only type of criminality facing us. We must also tackle diesel laundering and cigarette smuggling head on. Retail Ireland has pointed out that this recession has led to an increase in fuel smuggling and the sale of smuggled cigarettes. The impact of these activities has been very serious for our domestic economy. Last year Retail Ireland reported that 12% of all diesel sold in Ireland was illegal, 19 oil laundries were detected and closed, and 690,000 litres of oil were seized. These are massive figures which are having a huge effect on our economy and also hurting the communities in which they are taking place. Almost 25% of the Irish cigarette market is sourced from the black market and in 2011, 109 million illegal cigarettes, with a value of €45.9 million, were seized. The Exchequer is losing €861 million annually because of illegal black market activity and theft. We are already seeing a struggling retail sector as a result of the economic downturn and now we are seeing it suffer again because of the sale of counterfeit and smuggled goods. Retail Ireland has stated that sales have fallen by over 30% since the start of the recession and thousands of jobs have been lost. It is crucial that this sector is not further squeezed by illegal criminal activity. We must take on board some of the recommendations that have been put forward in this area. Retail Ireland, when addressing the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, offered to put money towards the scanners that could be used to detect illegal goods concealed in large containers that are coming into our ports. This is a simple, cost-effective action that can be taken to tackle this type of smuggling head on with fast and effective results. Retail Ireland also raised the open selling of counterfeit cigarettes in markets and the need to deploy Garda resources to police this. Mobile scanners can be used to detect these counterfeit tobacco products. The presentation by Retail Ireland not only outlined the scale of the problem but outlined solutions, and I commend it to the Minister. We must be more serious about white collar crime. The Minister will have been alarmed, as I was, to learn that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, including journalists from institutions as eminent as  People in this State were identified as playing a role in that. In this State historically we have seen accountants and solicitors who have colluded in this practice and encouraged clients to participate in this criminality, denying the State badly needed revenue for hospitals, school and communities.There was the spectacle of the Ansbacher scandal a number of years ago. How many went to jail over that scandal? Repeatedly, the people are exposed to white-collar crime which has an even more devastating impact than many of the cases that go through the circuit and district courts every week, but yet very few serve real time and pay the price for that. The deterrent needs to be much stronger. There has been plenty of forewarning of offshore accounts and tax avoidance. When will we deal with that? When will we demand full accountability from banks and all the professional classes to ensure that this stops once and for all? It is a global challenge, but Europe could lead the way with further amendments to legislation on these matters. As a party, we call not only for international co-operation on matters such as this, but also for a strong all-island policing policy. This is not merely an all-island issue. We need to tackle this internationally, and as strongly as possible. There can be no hiding place for criminals to squirrel away their illegally gained moneys and we must make sure of this, through international co-operation and co-operation on this island between our two policing services. In the recent past I had the privilege of meeting Assistant Garda Commissioner Kieran Kenny who is responsible directly for that relationship and the co-ordination between the PSNI and the Garda, and I was reassured by the messages I received from him and the practical examples of co-operations. I commend both police services for that and I hope to see more stronger co-operation in tackling the scourge of criminality on this island. I take this opportunity to re-pledge my party's support for the Criminal Assets Bureau on its significant successes. The CAB is a vital instrument in combatting gangs, going after what these people hold most dearly - their money. According to its latest figures, the CAB has seized more than €133 million of illicit profits from criminal activity since its foundation in 1996. I very much welcome this, but Sinn Féin would like to see some changes to how this money is used. My party has made a number of attempts - I, personally, have made one attempt - to bring forward a Private Members' Bill which would ensure that the money seized is ring-fenced for and reinvested in the communities worst affected by this type of activity. It was ruled out of order because of the cost to the Exchequer rule. I disagree with that. Our proposals would not be a cost to the Exchequer and would be cost neutral, but there it is. I would encourage the Minister to look at that. The money seized should be pumped into drugs task forces and community projects supporting communities affected by drugs crime and other crimes. Approximately, €14 million was seized solely under the proceeds of crime legislation between 2006 and 2010, and we have asked the Government to retain this money for community development purposes. This is separate to the money that is seized by CAB for revenue and social welfare fraud. It is the money taken from drug dealers and criminals who are profiting from the communities they are terrorising. The Government continues to cut community funding in general and the current legislation allows for all moneys collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau to be returned to the Exchequer in accordance with the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 and 2005. The funds are then paid into the Government's Central Fund, from which the Government draws for expenditure. If the Government had the political will to fund these much needed community organisations, it could easily do it by amending the Proceeds of Crime Acts. Sinn Féin calls on the Government to introduce this mechanism to fund local drugs task forces and community groups in the worst affected areas. Before I conclude, I would bring the Minister's attention to a couple of issues. Some of the previous money laundering Bills have had knock-on effects for some ordinary citizens inadvertently caught-up in criminal investigations. Can the Minister reassure me that if a person is cleared of any suspicion here, this will be the case internationally? We have seen situations where a person may have had money placed in his or her accounts by accident, arose suspicions, been cleared and then had it held against them while travelling. We need to ensure that the right procedures are taken to ensure data protection and consistency are followed. These laws also place a greater onus on small businesses to pour more resources, often with a financial impact, into identifying customers. We need to ensure that in any legislation such as this that we are passing the House does not contain anything that has the potential to make life difficult for normal citizens and small businesses. Can the Minister assure me that where this Bill means a small-business owner must take steps to further establish a customer's identity and there is a financial burden, the small business will be compensated for this? I suggest that some of the money seized may be used to make provision for businesses affected in this way. I reiterate my support and that of my party for this Bill. However, I seek reassurance from the Minister on those issues to which I referred before it reaches the next Stage."	spk_200

Were one to put together all those families, it would fill Croke Park five times. This demonstrates the seriousness of this profound crisis, in which one in four mortgages across the State is now in distress. I took the Personal Insolvency Bill on behalf of Sinn Féin and sat through approximately 14 or 15 hours of debate on it. Sinn Féin and others pressed repeatedly to remove the veto from the banks in that process because we thought the banks would not have the necessary compunction to do the right thing, that is, to engage and to be serious. Unfortunately, however, our attempts and amendments were rejected repeatedly. Consequently, the aforementioned Bill will be no panacea. I note the worrying messages, both domestically and internationally, that are asking banks here to go after families and to engage in repossessions. As a west of Ireland man, the Taoiseach knows the scale of the crisis in his part of the world. During the recess, I spoke to many people in County Donegal about its impact and they are deeply concerned, particularly those who had worked in that sector and who best understand the scale of the extant personal debt crisis. Deputy Mathews, who is in the Chamber, warned a long time ago that this issue was as big a crisis as the issue of recapitalisation and bondholders. Now that we are getting to the problem, some sense of urgency and realism is needed within the Cabinet. This takes me to my final set of questions, which pertain to the Economic Management Council and engagement with the banks. First, the Taoiseach has indicated the Government intends to reverse the Dunne judgment and will introduce amending legislation, including the land and conveyancing law reform Bill and so on. This is causing serious concern. For example, has the Government discussed with the banks the rate of repossessions it seeks? Is that the type of conversation it is having? Has the Government discussed the issue of debt write-downs or is the scope for so doing being discussed? I wish to revisit the issue of lending to small businesses. As the Taoiseach is aware, the representative groups for small businesses have been telling Members repeatedly - as any Deputy would know from talking to people involved in small businesses - there is a real problem with getting a credit flow to them. This obviously would be of critical assistance to developing the economy across the State in particular, and I seek the Taoiseach's views in this regard. On the mortgage arrears crisis, how many times has the Economic Management Council met this year? Has the Government grasped the urgency of the scale of this crisis and how serious it would get were it to go after people in the manner suggested?	spk_168

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-04-16	dail	31	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_19	When one considers the scale of the crisis, which affects more than 185,000 households, is the Taoiseach satisfied the committee on mortgage arrears is meeting sufficiently regularly? Were one to put together all those families, it would fill Croke Park five times. This demonstrates the seriousness of this profound crisis, in which one in four mortgages across the State is now in distress. I took the Personal Insolvency Bill on behalf of Sinn Féin and sat through approximately 14 or 15 hours of debate on it. Sinn Féin and others pressed repeatedly to remove the veto from the banks in that process because we thought the banks would not have the necessary compunction to do the right thing, that is, to engage and to be serious. Unfortunately, however, our attempts and amendments were rejected repeatedly. Consequently, the aforementioned Bill will be no panacea. I note the worrying messages, both domestically and internationally, that are asking banks here to go after families and to engage in repossessions. As a west of Ireland man, the Taoiseach knows the scale of the crisis in his part of the world. During the recess, I spoke to many people in County Donegal about its impact and they are deeply concerned, particularly those who had worked in that sector and who best understand the scale of the extant personal debt crisis. Deputy Mathews, who is in the Chamber, warned a long time ago that this issue was as big a crisis as the issue of recapitalisation and bondholders. Now that we are getting to the problem, some sense of urgency and realism is needed within the Cabinet. This takes me to my final set of questions, which pertain to the Economic Management Council and engagement with the banks. First, the Taoiseach has indicated the Government intends to reverse the Dunne judgment and will introduce amending legislation, including the land and conveyancing law reform Bill and so on. This is causing serious concern. For example, has the Government discussed with the banks the rate of repossessions it seeks? Is that the type of conversation it is having? Has the Government discussed the issue of debt write-downs or is the scope for so doing being discussed? I wish to revisit the issue of lending to small businesses. As the Taoiseach is aware, the representative groups for small businesses have been telling Members repeatedly - as any Deputy would know from talking to people involved in small businesses - there is a real problem with getting a credit flow to them. This obviously would be of critical assistance to developing the economy across the State in particular, and I seek the Taoiseach's views in this regard. On the mortgage arrears crisis, how many times has the Economic Management Council met this year? Has the Government grasped the urgency of the scale of this crisis and how serious it would get were it to go after people in the manner suggested?	spk_168
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-04-16	dail	31	Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill 2013: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_29	I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, on introducing the Bill and on all the hard work he has done in respect of this issue. I take this opportunity to mention Arthur Morgan, our party's representative for Louth in the previous Dáil, who, in conjunction with Deputy Ó Caoláin, also worked extremely hard on this issue. I welcome to the House the women from the Survivors of Symphysiotomy group. These women have shown incredible bravery and strength throughout their ordeal. I have the utmost respect and admiration for them. I pay tribute to Marie O'Connor who has worked with them and brought her considerable expertise to bear on their campaign. Symphysiotomy is a cruel and dangerous childbirth operation that unhinges the pelvis, severing the symphysis joint or, in the case of pubiotomy, sundering the pubic bones. Ireland was the only country in the developed world to practise this discarded surgery in the mid to late 20th century. At least 1,500 of these 18th century operations were performed here from 1942 to 2005, mostly in Catholic hospitals. Approximately 200 women who underwent this procedure survive today, many of them permanently disabled, incontinent and in pain. Some lost their babies during the procedure. These operations were performed in preference to caesarean section, the standard treatment for difficult births. The women involved were subjected to a barbaric and cruel practice of which the State should be ashamed. Not only should the State be ashamed of how they were treated, it should also be ashamed of the length of time it has taken for them to find truth and justice. The latter, it is hoped, will be forthcoming in the very near future. The women to whom I refer were subjected to brutality many years ago and they are still being subjected to a form of it now because they are prevented from seeking redress. A wide range of Deputies will contribute to the debate on the Bill. However, that is not enough. It is not sufficient to stand up in the Chamber and simply empathise with these women. We are legislators and we must legislate in the best interests of all the citizens of this State, including the women who have come here tonight hoping for some acknowledgement in respect of the hideous procedure to which they were subjected. That is what we are here to do and it is our duty. As justice spokesperson for Sinn Féin, I want to see justice done. After all these years and all the trauma inflicted upon them, these women must be able to seek the redress they so rightly deserve. That which has been introduced by Deputy Ó Caoláin is a legal necessity. The bar created by the Statute of Limitations sets a two-year time limit on initiating actions in personal cases and it has blocked the efforts of many of the women affected by symphysiotomy. As most Members are aware, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality recommended the lifting of the statute bar in June of 2012. These women will finally be able to take legal action, if they so desire, if that bar is removed. Since taking my seat in this Chamber, we have engaged in numerous debates in respect of women and the way they have been treated by the State. We owe it to the women of Ireland to allow the Bill before the House to pass Second Stage tomorrow night. We must face up to our shameful record on the relationship of women with this State and begin attempting to right the wrongs to which I refer. Many of the women who were subjected to the cruel procedure of symphysiotomy have sadly passed away. The State let them down. Let us not visit a similar fate on one more survivor. This House must legislate for these women and it must do so now. Every Deputy was deeply moved when the Taoiseach finally apologised on behalf of the State for the Magdalen laundries. We met the women afterwards. It meant a great deal to them. We must still bring the issue of redress home, as we must the issue of Bethany Home. Our people must face a number of great shames. The heroic, inspirational and wonderful women gathered above the Chamber tonight must be given the same apology by the Taoiseach on behalf of the State as well as the redress to which they are entitled. The Bill must also be passed. All of this is what they deserve, no more and no less.	spk_305

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-03-21	dail	31	Disability Services: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_4	Recently we discussed the issue of a mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant at the joint committee, following which we had the abrupt announcement that it was to cease pending the outcome of the consultation process in the time ahead. Since then the centres for independent living have contacted the members of the joint committee and have addressed it outlining their profound concerns. Profoundly disabled people were present for the hearing. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure there are no more cuts for disabled people. We cannot go back to the days of institutionalisation which cost the State more money. I appeal to her to resolve that issue. I have two abiding memories of all the years I have canvassed as a candidate in elections. The first was in a rural area of north Donegal and driving through windy roads and eventually arriving at a farm. When we got to the farmyard the woman of the house, an incredibly positive person, was tending the sheep. She went into the house but I was not aware of what was ahead. Her husband had been paralysed in a car accident many years before and her father-in-law was elderly and almost immobile. She was looking after her husband and father-in-law and the farm. When leaving the house, after meeting this remarkably positive woman, I was informed that her sons are the pride of not just that family but the entire community. This woman was a carer of two men who were incapacitated and looked after a farm.  I remember an incredible woman in her early 80s closer to my home place, Buncrana, in the Clonmany area. Her foster son, a talented young boxer in his early 20s, had been paralysed. The doctors told her there was no hope of a recovery and that he would be in a vegetative state. Given her love and affection, she took him home, looked after him and nurtured him. He was able to communicate by typing words. Every one of us, irrespective of which side of the House we are on, is a decent human being and we want to do the best for our communities. The memory of those two women will always be with me. I know there are many similar stories.  We cannot fail carers of disabled people, we cannot let them down. Whatever has to be done we cannot fail such people. In all sincerity we need to have a threshold of decency in terms of what point we get to and we need to ensure that people who are profoundly disabled and their carers, people who need our support as a Republic, are given their independence and dignity in order that they can be productive citizens. Does it really matter if one is economically productive? If one can be there for one's family that means a great deal. We have had too many cuts. The Government needs to do much more. The previous Government put in place cuts of 10% in the income of people with disabilities, including a cut to the blind person's allowance, cuts to grants for housing extension, cuts in health, education and so on. Those cuts will have to be reversed. I repeat again there will have to be a threshold of decency. Whatever our political perspectives in this House, we are decent people. We would not have been elected if we were not decent people. We have the support of our communities to come to this House. We need to ensure we do not fail disabled persons any more. We must ensure that those people in wheelchairs who had been empowered and are terrified at the idea of going backwards, are not impacted further.	spk_203

Ireland has a proud history of neutrality. Our Defence Forces have served across the world under blue helmet operations. Our people have played a leading role in conflict resolution on an ongoing basis, and that is our position. The Secretary General knows that very well. He was here because we have the EU Presidency and he should have been respectful of our neutrality. I am disappointed the Government has yet to publicly rebuke him. Has its members privately rebuked him? Have they complained to his office that it was disrespectful that he would be on some kind of a recruitment exercise? It must increasingly be asked as to what is the point of NATO. It was about the Cold War between the USSR and the United States and two different world views. That is all over, apparently, and we have the United Nations which is supposed to be the body that is responsible for conflict resolution. What is NATO for, what is it about, and how dare its Secretary General come here and say that we should join it, rather than respect our neutrality?

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-03-12	dail	31	Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_24	"Sinn Féin welcomes this legislation which is long overdue. The inaction on this issue for so long has had a seriously negative impact on those who made mistakes in the past, paid for their non-violent crime and yet had their conviction hanging over them for the rest of their lives. Ireland is the only jurisdiction in the European Union which does not have in place appropriate legislation to ensure certain criminal convictions can be expunged and people can move on with their lives and make a clean start with a clean slate. We are all aware of the problems that result from this. People have difficulties in obtaining visas and accessing employment, education and training courses. Many of them cannot take out certain types of insurance and are prevented from taking out a mortgage on that basis. This jurisdiction is far behind the rest of Europe on this issue. However, we do agree that an appropriate range of employments should be expressly excluded. However, these employment-related exemptions should be limited and offence-relevant. For example, it is obviously crucial that work involving substantial access to children or vulnerable adults should be afforded special protection. However, broad and blanket exclusion of all posts in health care, the Civil Service and certain legal and financial-related posts is not justified by the evidence. Where the nature of a past conviction is not relevant, employers and others should not be permitted to discriminate. While we welcome this Bill, there are several problems with it and we will table amendments to seek to have these rectified on Committee and Report Stages. I am hopeful the Minister will take these suggestions on board. These are not ""out there"" suggestions but are considered normal in most other European jurisdictions. Framing this legislation correctly will be key to ensuring the successful reintegration of prisoners in society. Clearly, the Bill must apply to a wide range of convictions and the rehabilitation periods before a conviction can be spent must be reasonable and proportionate to the original conviction. In any area of employment where a conviction will still required to be declared, despite being spent must, under normal circumstances, it must be kept to a minimum and justified based on the public good. The Bill will not apply to most sentences and, while it is welcome that it has been agreed to on Seanad Stage that suspended sentences of up to 24 months can be considered spent, it is a shame this has not been amended to ensure custodial sentences of this length and up to 48 months, as is the case under the British legislation, would also be included. We will seek to have this amended, as the Bill will currently only apply to sentences of less than one year in prison. This is simply not adequate for the needs of those who have served their sentence and are not at risk of reoffending. There are also issues regarding the various combinations of custodial and non­custodial sentences and people may find this difficult to follow. Furthermore, some of the periods of ""rehabilitation"" are on the excessive side. Six to seven years in the case of certain convictions is simply too long. Likewise, a further age-related tier, linked with the length of the rehabilitation period required, should be introduced. In the Twenty-six Counties the Children's Act 2001 makes provision for the convictions of children to become spent after a time. However, an 18-year old who commits a once-off minor offence may have this conviction hanging over him or her until he or she is nearly 30 years old because the seven-year rehabilitation period dates from conviction which may take place up to two years after actual commission of the offence. Facing employment-related discrimination during these crucial years, when the foundations of a career are laid, will have lifelong negative consequences. A tier requiring shorter rehabilitation periods for those who offend between the ages of 18 and 20 years should be introduced. I understand there may be a reluctance on the part of some to go down the road of introducing different reduced rehabilitation periods in case the former prisoner concerned reoffends. However, this is certainly not the first jurisdiction to introduce such legislation; therefore, we must look to other jurisdictions which have relevant experience and see how it has actually worked for them. There is a simpler way of doing this and we will table amendments to that effect on Committee Stage.  There are other technical provisions which need to be amended. We welcome the exclusion of spent convictions from general court proceedings. However, the legislation in its current form allows circumstances that might require courts to deviate from that general approach ""where justice cannot be done except by so admitting or requiring the evidence"" of spent convictions, as set out in section 6(2). The implications of this are not clear. Some exclusions related to a number of specific types of legal proceedings seem reasonable and proportionate, although others seem vague and may require further clarification. We note that the Irish Penal Reform Trust has concerns about the exclusion of certain areas of employment and the potential impact on individuals seeking to benefit from the Bill.  Regarding the provision for new areas of employment to be excluded from the Bill, any additional area of employment should only be introduced in consultation with other Departments. As there are very important issues of equality and privacy that must be addressed, the Bill should also provide for consultation with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Data Protection Commissioner. In fact, there is an argument to be made that both bodies should appear before the committee to discuss this Bill. Sinn Féin believes effective post-release reintegration of offenders with their families and communities once a custodial sentence has been served is essential for the prevention of reoffending and, therefore, ensuring community safety.As that is in everyone's best interests, the Bill is more than welcome. Since it is our view that the primary objective of justice policy is to prevent crime, part of the emphasis must be on incentivising crime-free lifestyles by ensuring gainful employment is available to ex-prisoners, but this should not be out of the reach of the majority of prisoners. To this end, unwarranted barriers and discrimination in law or policy must be proactively removed. A range of barriers currently serve to inhibit the reintegration of all those with a past conviction, especially ex-prisoners, most of which are not addressed in the Bill. The fields in which discrimination operates to exclude those with a past conviction include employment, accommodation, travel and adoption, among others. The extent of this discrimination should not be underestimated.  Sinn Féin also supports the existing regime for the expungement of criminal records of juveniles in so far as it is consistent with principles established under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. A recent study found that nearly half of employers said they would not employ someone with a criminal record. Far from effectively protecting the public, these barriers actually serve to exacerbate Ireland's already high rates of repeat offending. If this and previous Governments actually wanted to remedy crime, they might have tried to do this years ago. I received a letter from the Mercy Law Resource Centre which told me that in 2011 there were 3,808 people sleeping rough. There are clear and documented links between homelessness and crime, recidivism and reoffending. Effective and humane justice policies cost the State less in the long term. We need more initiatives like this that will reduce crime and allow people to reintegrate. A spent convictions regime for non-disclosure of criminal records should be supported by all in order to facilitate post-release reintegration through employment and prevent other forms of discrimination. More than a decade after the Good Friday Agreement, former political prisoners are still subject to grave discrimination in a wide range of areas. The political nature of the conflict in Ireland has now been recognised. This recognition must be formally extended to ex-political prisoners and discrimination against them needs to end. It is Sinn Féin's long-standing and firm position that records of all former political prisoners should be expunged to assist the process of national reconciliation and discrimination on the basis of a conflict-related conviction should be prohibited by law to enable such former prisoners to participate as equals in all aspects of economic and social life. It is a scandal that this has not been addressed in the past. Both Sinn Féin and the Irish Human Rights Commission have also proposed that equality legislation be extended to include criminal conviction as one of the grounds on which discrimination in employment, except where objectively incompatible with job responsibilities, and the provision of services is prohibited. This protection is crucial to ensure effective post-release reintegration, in particular, through the provision of adequate and appropriate housing. This is also something that must be included in this Bill.  I urge the Minister to take on board our suggestions and commend the Bill to the House. We will engage with the Minister on Committee Stage when it commences next Wednesday and continue the discussion then."	spk_443
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-03-12	dail	31	Job Creation and Economic Growth: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_26	I had hoped to have an opportunity to discuss the unemployment crisis in County Donegal with the Minister at an earlier stage last year, but his colleague, the Minister of State, took the debate on that occasion. I will take this opportunity to take the Minister through the history of the unemployment crisis in County Donegal as the crisis is not. As he will recall, the Fruit of the Loom textile industry collapsed in County Donegal and the signs of its decline were evident in the late 1990s. It finally collapsed in the early 2000s. An employment task force was established by the then Government to address the crisis caused not only by the collapse of Fruit of the Loom but also the collapse off the entire textile industry in the region. Definite job creation targets were put in place in the next seven years that would have amounted to a net gain of approximately 6,000 jobs. That was the scale of what was required to allow County Donegal to start to catch up with the then employment levels across the State. After a period of almost seven years, however, there was no real progress. Unemployment levels in the county were still at or around 14% to 15% which at the time were almost four times the national average. An interdepartmental group was set up to work across all Departments as there was a unique job creation challenge in County Donegal. As we approached the late 2000s, some 8,300 people were unemployed in the county, a large number of people equating to an unemployment level of 14%. The level of unemployment in County Donegal today is 28%, which means approximately 23,000 people are out of full-time employment. This presents a profound crisis in the county. Donegal is a county with natural entrepreneurs, people who want to work if they were given the chance to do so. In that respect, there are one or two examples. Primerica stands out as a solid example of what the workforce in County Donegal has to offer, if given the chance. I will give the Minister some shocking statistics. I remind him that while unemployment levels are bad throughout the country, the unemployment levels in County Donegal are the highest in the State by a mile, while the youth unemployment rate is almost at 50%. I will cite statistics for last year for the job creation agencies. In the case of Enterprise Ireland, there were 129 net job losses in County Donegal. The number of site visits by IDA Ireland in the county in 2012 was zero, despite the crisis we face in the county. As the Minister will be aware, IDA Ireland was to ensure 50% of jobs would be created outside the major cities of Dublin and Cork. However, outside of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and County Louth, the percentage of jobs attracted to rural Ireland, including my county of Donegal, which has approximately 50% of the population was 2.5% of the overall number of jobs attracted to the country. I commend IDA Ireland for its work. When I was my party's spokesperson on foreign affairs and trade, I had the opportunity to see for myself in the United States the reputation it had earned and the work it did there, but it is not attracting jobs to the regions. I note in the Minister's latest plan that he has apparently scrapped the 50% target. How can he stand over this? How could he go on a Donegal radio station or visit the county and tell the people there that the Government has its finger on the pulse and that he is aware of the extent of the crisis? As the Minister knows, there are solutions. He does not need to listen to Sinn Féin in this respect. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and every Nobel Prize winning economist would tell him that we need to reverse the insanity of only having austerity policies. There are billions of euro in the National Pensions Reserve Fund; there is also the European Investment Bank and there are pension funds in Ireland. Therefore, there are resources that could be deployed. People must be given hope. As a representative of the people of Donegal, the level of unemployment in the county has gone from bad to worse. People there want to work and the Government must meet them half way. It must attract investment into the regions and assist employers to keep employees in work. We have given the Minister a range of proposals which we have presented in our jobs plan. I have given him the figures for my county and they are indefensible. His colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, has joined him. I addressed the Minister of State last year and brought these numbers to his attention. The Minister knows the wider issues involved. I cannot stand here and not directly bring to his attention the scale of the crisis in County Donegal and the failure of the job creation agencies and the Government to address it. He must give the people of the county some hope. I, therefore, ask him to take on board what I have said.	spk_458

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-03-06	dail	31	Road Traffic Offences	dbsect_13	That is grand. I submitted these questions because of dialogue with a number of gardaí in different parts of the State. They are concerned that in their districts, the dedicated focus on drugs and crime detection was being lessened by cutbacks and reallocation. In a number of places where I spoke to officers, they would have had considerable success in the area. Garda units with mobile patrols can quickly get on top of burglaries, and there is still good intelligence between communities and gardaí in that regard. Mobile patrols remain a significant deterrent. This feeds into the overall picture from gardaí and the issue I have raised regarding pay, why they are so distressed and the reason morale is so low. They do not have the resources to do their job. There are lies, damn lies and statistics and we can engage back and forth in that regard. Nevertheless, the feedback from gardaí on the ground is that the dedicated focus in a number of these areas of law enforcement is being lessened by cutbacks.	spk_293
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-03-06	dail	31	Road Traffic Offences	dbsect_13	I have received feedback from officers both in an urban setting and in two rural settings. The feedback is that they are seeing less capacity to do their job and these gardaí are very frustrated. There was a wave of burglaries in Donegal but I am thankful there was a special operation to tackle that. We met the assistant commissioner and I applaud the Garda because it very quickly got on top of the issue, albeit with additional resources deployed on a short-term basis. That did the business. I urge the Minister to engage with representative associations. I appreciate the Croke Park agreement issue and the Minister knows our position. We are not happy that those at the high end have not felt the same pain as those on the front line. We could go back and forth to argue about whether the Garda Representative Association should have been part of the talks. It has indicated it was never at the table. Somebody has failed the ordinary gardaí and those on the front line, with low morale, will take another hit on take-home pay. We must do something about it because there is a crisis of morale. If these people do not feel they have support in these Houses, it will bring consequences.	spk_297

Its core crisis concerns the need to have enough refuge centres for women. As I am sure the Minister knows, one in five women in Ireland has reported she has been a victim of domestic abuse, either with her current or previous partner. This is a shocking statistic.

Apparently, it is limited to a number of districts. It is not widespread. The bottom line is that the public needs to know. It would be appalling and outrageous for the overwhelming majority of motorists who have paid their fine, taken the points, taken it on the chin and adapted their driving to think that there was some arrangement. This is a most serious matter. Unfortunately, sometimes it gets caught up in persons being named, etc. The bottom line is a significant number of road traffic offences have allegedly been written off without any proper procedure being taken by senior members of the Garda. Those are the allegations to which a number of Deputies are privy. I appreciate the Minister's response that he will await the report in two weeks' time. I commend him for stating he will publish the report. It needs to be done. At that stage, we need a full and frank debate in this House about the report and its implications and where we go from there. It does a damning disservice to the overwhelming majority of gardaí who serve the State will great pride that, in the issues that we have been raised today they perhaps involve only a small minority of the force.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-03-06	dail	31	Garda Deployment	dbsect_15	That is grand. I submitted these questions because of dialogue with a number of gardaí in different parts of the State. They are concerned that in their districts, the dedicated focus on drugs and crime detection was being lessened by cutbacks and reallocation. In a number of places where I spoke to officers, they would have had considerable success in the area. Garda units with mobile patrols can quickly get on top of burglaries, and there is still good intelligence between communities and gardaí in that regard. Mobile patrols remain a significant deterrent. This feeds into the overall picture from gardaí and the issue I have raised regarding pay, why they are so distressed and the reason morale is so low. They do not have the resources to do their job. There are lies, damn lies and statistics and we can engage back and forth in that regard. Nevertheless, the feedback from gardaí on the ground is that the dedicated focus in a number of these areas of law enforcement is being lessened by cutbacks.	spk_293
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-03-06	dail	31	Garda Deployment	dbsect_15	I have received feedback from officers both in an urban setting and in two rural settings. The feedback is that they are seeing less capacity to do their job and these gardaí are very frustrated. There was a wave of burglaries in Donegal but I am thankful there was a special operation to tackle that. We met the assistant commissioner and I applaud the Garda because it very quickly got on top of the issue, albeit with additional resources deployed on a short-term basis. That did the business. I urge the Minister to engage with representative associations. I appreciate the Croke Park agreement issue and the Minister knows our position. We are not happy that those at the high end have not felt the same pain as those on the front line. We could go back and forth to argue about whether the Garda Representative Association should have been part of the talks. It has indicated it was never at the table. Somebody has failed the ordinary gardaí and those on the front line, with low morale, will take another hit on take-home pay. We must do something about it because there is a crisis of morale. If these people do not feel they have support in these Houses, it will bring consequences.	spk_297

Its core crisis concerns the need to have enough refuge centres for women. As I am sure the Minister knows, one in five women in Ireland has reported she has been a victim of domestic abuse, either with her current or previous partner. This is a shocking statistic. How can the Minister assure the relevant organisations that the Government can offer them the real supports they need such that when a woman – it is almost always a woman - and her children present themselves in a crisis, they can be given the refuge they need?	spk_305

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-03-06	dail	31	Road Traffic Offences	dbsect_18	Some of the other Deputies have referred to whistleblowers within the force having brought into the public domain what they claim to be shoddy practice. Apparently, it is limited to a number of districts. It is not widespread. The bottom line is that the public needs to know. It would be appalling and outrageous for the overwhelming majority of motorists who have paid their fine, taken the points, taken it on the chin and adapted their driving to think that there was some arrangement. This is a most serious matter. Unfortunately, sometimes it gets caught up in persons being named, etc. The bottom line is a significant number of road traffic offences have allegedly been written off without any proper procedure being taken by senior members of the Garda. Those are the allegations to which a number of Deputies are privy. I appreciate the Minister's response that he will await the report in two weeks' time. I commend him for stating he will publish the report. It needs to be done. At that stage, we need a full and frank debate in this House about the report and its implications and where we go from there. It does a damning disservice to the overwhelming majority of gardaí who serve the State will great pride that, in the issues that we have been raised today they perhaps involve only a small minority of the force. We will see how the report comes out but the allegations are very serious.	spk_321
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-02-27	dail	31	Magdalen Laundries Report: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_5	"As I have outlined before, Sinn Féin welcomed the apology from the Taoiseach on behalf of the State to the women incarcerated in the Magdalen laundries. While we commend those involved in putting together the McAleese report, it really only scratches the surface of what went on in Ireland during that time. This should be seen as a starting point in the healing process of the wounds inflicted on the women of Ireland, particularly poor women, by the apparatus of the State. The women who were the victims of barbaric symphysiotomy practices are still waiting for their apology. The apparatus of the State actively facilitated the injuries inflicted on them. Women's bodies were seen as things that needed to be contained and fixed. Poorer women were held in contempt in Ireland. We still have a constitutional provision that refers to women's duties as being within the home and are still living with the effects of these attitudes.Too many people on this island are due apologies from the State. Considering what happens now within the care system, and going by previous Governments' form on these issues, there will be an apology owed to them too. However, it is not only the State that is required to say it is sorry. The religious orders are glaringly absent from this. Too many sets of financial records from the laundries have gone missing. There must be further investigations into this, and prosecutions must be initiated where appropriate. Slave labour was tolerated in these laundries and women suffered unspeakable injuries as a result. Many of them never recovered. Some of them never got out and were buried in unmarked graves because their lives were not worth as much as an individual headstone to the nuns or the State. The burying of those poor women in unmarked graves is the aspect that has really struck a nerve. The State and religious orders had such contempt for these women that there were girls who did not even have names. I have heard of women who merely had numbers allocated to them. There were no birth certificates and by virtue of accidents of birth, class and gender they were consigned to laundries. Women who should not have been in the laundries and tried to escape were promptly rounded up by the Garda and returned to their lives of slave labour. There was a bizarre culture of deference in Ireland whereby the people - the State - allowed clerics to dictate what should or should not be social norms in society. It was a society that allowed women to be locked up because they happened to be too pretty. It is actually mind-boggling. Religious orders facilitated the incarceration of people they disapproved of in institutions built on systematic cruelty and torment. They were violent, as attested to by the pages of testimony from women that were not included in the McAleese report. When I think of Christ, I think of the Christ of love, compassion, understanding, empathy and courage, who was not afraid to speak up to the powerful and reached out to the dispossessed and those on the margins of society. He was a true inspiration through the ages, spiritually and in every way. What in the name of God had the message of Christ to do with the institutions run in his name or that of the Virgin Mary? What in the name of God would have led anybody involved with those institutions to believe they were acting in God's name or following the path and message of Jesus Christ? Their actions, attitudes and control over our people in that period were everything that is opposite to the message of Jesus Christ. What they must closely reflect on is the damage they did to the good name of Christianity and to acting in the name of Christ and that of the Virgin Mary over the years. Shame on every one of them. Shame on them for claiming that mantle as theirs. There must be an apology for this. However, these institutions were not just about the social or moral policing of women in Ireland. Let us make no mistake - the Magdalen slaves were financial assets to the laundries. The laundries were businesses. Any business that was given access by the State to almost unlimited free labour would have done very well; one need not be an economist to know that. Plenty of people did very well indeed out of the unmerciful cruelty that was inflicted on these women, just as there were well-to-do people in Ireland at the time who did well from not having to pay children from industrial schools who were sent to do unpaid domestic and agricultural work. Ireland has seen plenty of forced labour over the years. The religious orders did not run the laundries out of the goodness of their hearts. These women are owed compensation and their unpaid wages and pensions. They are owed proper redress, and to hear word ""sorry"" from the religious orders. There are major questions about how the redress scheme will operate. Experience in these matters indicates that the Irish State is not one that makes these structures victim-centred. Some who went to the Residential Institutions Redress Board found the experience horrific and felt it was only another opportunity for legal practitioners to make money. The religious orders pleaded that they had no money. The State has failed to deal with this quickly. The terms of reference must be published immediately. The fact that there will be an  I wish to return to the issue of faith and to the abuse of the privilege that comes with being a leader who has the huge honour of being a vehicle for the message of Christ and a pathway to God. That is how these people presented themselves. I have had the privilege of knowing many fine people of faith from when I was a young lad and throughout my life. There were some fantastic priests. Fr. Jimmy Doherty, RIP, who died of multiple sclerosis, was a wonderful man who worked with young people in my home town of Buncrana. I think of the people who, to me, represented the message of Christ throughout my life, such as the priests and nuns who served as missionaries, fought against oppressive regimes and stood side by side with the people in Africa, Latin America and Asia. They are inspirational; they follow the path of Christ. However, far too many in the institution of the Catholic Church and other Christian institutions have walked away from that path, have besmirched the name of Jesus Christ by acting maliciously and cruelly, and have left this legacy. I pose a challenge to the Catholic Church, as the conclave of cardinals gathers shortly to select a new Pope. The church must drive away cruelty, malice, protection of the powerful and greedy and the refusal to stand up against an unjust and unequal system in which people are starving and dying while others live in incredible wealth in this country and across Europe, the United States and the developed world. The world we live in is a shameful insult to the message of Christ, and the church is not doing enough about that. When a house assigned to Travellers was burned down recently in Ballyshannon, where was the church? Where were the voices of Christ to challenge that bigotry and indifference? Even in 2013 there are too many in the church who are failing in their responsibilities. There are also wonderful and courageous voices in the church who truly follow the path of Christ. Rather than have all this debate in the Vatican about protecting the orthodox and so-called tradition, it is time to knock it down and rebuild it. It is time to start from scratch. There is no better place to start than with the message of Christ that it is better to live in poverty than to live in opulence and wealth. Consider the Vatican, St. Peter's Square and St. Peter's Basilica. Are they modest structures? Do they reflect the modesty of Christ? I believe the missionaries living in modest accommodation in Africa and Latin America are the vehicles of Christ. If people are looking for the centre of faith, they should not go to the Vatican or to any of the big cathedrals in the world, but to the missions, where people are delivering love, empathy and support. The issue of the Magdalen laundries, other institutions and all the challenges we see throughout the world show it is time to revisit the issue of faith. It is time for modesty and humility. It is time to start again. It is also time to talk to the people who genuinely follow the path of Christ in our missions, who work with the poor and stand up against oppression, and who say the capitalist system in place across the world is in defiance of his message. It is time for real courage. If the church goes there, it will then win the hearts and minds of people across the world and will truly follow in the path of Christ again."	spk_194

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-02-20	dail	31	Mortgage Restructuring: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_32	The first section of the Sinn Féin motion refers to housing. A lay person looks at all of this in bewilderment. Not so long ago, turnkey housing developments were being sold at full market value throughout the State. Now, houses have halved in value. There is a simple economic rule of thumb that at a time of recession the Government should intervene, first, because it creates jobs, second, because it gets the best possible deal for the taxpayer and third, because it prepares the economy for the turnaround. We should be buying houses now. We should purchase all those ghost estates for social housing because they are coming in at half the price of years gone by. We are not doing that. Instead, we are opting for ten year leases, which is a crazy economic proposition for the taxpayer. This is because of the absence of an overall strategy. Sinn Féin has said repeatedly that we could look at the National Pensions Reserve Fund, twinned with the European Investment Bank potential and private pension funds. It is not only Sinn Féin which says this. It is also proposed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Sinn Féin talks about a €13 billion stimulus package over four years. A key aspect of that would be the provision of social housing. There are solutions, if we are brave and imaginative enough to look at them. There are 100,000 people on housing waiting lists at this stage. This is a real crisis, and it brings me to the next section of the motion. A previous speaker said mortgage distress affects only a small number of people. That is an incredible statement for a Deputy to make. One in four mortgage holders is in distress. That is approximately 168,000 households. If we took just one representative from each of those households we would fill Croke Park twice. That is the scale of the crisis. Any Deputy who has their finger on the pulse of their community and listens to their constituents knows this is a crisis. I could talk for the next two hours about conversations I have had with families in Donegal and about people who ring me late at night in total dismay and distress asking if they should hand back the keys of their house. They put impossible situations to me. These people are just ordinary five eighths, like me. They were not experts on the economy a number of years ago. We believed the economists and our politicians at that time. We believed all the hype in the newspapers. One could not open a newspaper without seeing a property supplement. We read about soft landings. Prices could only go up. We should buy while prices were at that level. We would be crazy not to. That is what people bought into. They were betrayed and they remain betrayed because there is no solution. This brings me to the final issue in the motion. I sat through 17 or 18 hours of debate on the various Stages of the Personal Insolvency Bill. On the final night, something symbolic happened. The so-called public interest director of Permanent TSB, Mr. Ray MacSharry, told my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, there would be no write-downs. Later, Professor Patrick Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank, said he was tearing his hair out because the banks will not go after debt. People at home must be totally bewildered. We have put tens of billions of euro into these banks.Today AIB has stated it will increase its variable mortgage interest rate but we own 100% of that bank. People are bewildered that there was a solution for the bondholders, for the extremely wealthy gamblers who were so reckless, but the people themselves have been betrayed. One in four mortgage holders is in difficulty. This crisis is fundamental and must be addressed in a focused, urgent and determined fashion. Our motion does not just identify the problem, it offers solutions, as Sinn Féin motions always do. At some point someone must listen and realise the emperor is wearing no clothes.	spk_346

My party has put on the table proposals regarding the reform of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, such as narrowing the numbers that are to be short-listed for presentation to the Minister, providing clear explanations for decisions taken and likewise, that the Minister provide clear explanations for decisions he makes. Is that a way forward?	spk_159

It is hard to imagine the agony and grief that his wife and children are going through. There are no words that could even begin to ease their suffering. It truly is a tragedy and an unfathomable loss. The community of Lordship in County Louth, the people of Ireland, my Dáil colleagues and I were shocked by the callous murder of Detective Garda Donohoe. If any person has information that might bring his killers to justice, he or she should go to the Garda or the PSNI with it immediately. Gardaí deal with high-risk, dangerous circumstances day in, day out, and that takes nerve. Gardaí take these risks in order that the rest of us do not have to. It takes courage and bravery at a level that is difficult for the rest of us to understand.The men and women who serve our communities should not have to put on their uniforms in the morning, wave goodbye to their families and wonder whether they will make it home that night. It is important at this time to acknowledge the work they undertake in very difficult circumstances. Adrian Donohoe died while trying to protect his community. I am sure I speak for everyone when I say our thoughts are with his family, his friends, his colleagues and An Garda Síochána at this very sad time. Ar dheis de go raibh a anam.	spk_236

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	40	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2013-01-29	dail	31	An Garda Síochána: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_31	I wish to share time with Deputy Michael Colreavy. Fianna Fáil has a hard neck to speak about cutbacks to Garda stations. In November 2008, my party colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, who was then a Senator, published a document entitled Awakening the West, which documented how rural communities were being hammered by the Government. The Government at that time was a Fianna Fáil and Green Party coalition. By November 2008, almost half of all the Garda stations in Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway and Roscommon had been reduced to one garda operating on a part-time basis. In many of those cases, Garda stations were closed on Sundays and opening hours during the week were limited to 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Even at that time, the limited opening hours and lack of Garda strength in rural stations gave rise to the perception that Garda services were ceasing to exist in many rural areas. There were towns where there was no Garda service for miles around. This all took place under the watch of Fianna Fáil. At the 2009 annual conference of the Garda Representative Association, GRA, the then president, Michael O'Boyce, warned that the government was driving experience out of An Garda Síochána and that a rising number of members of all ranks, who could and who wanted to continue to serve the country, were considering retirement. A year later, at the 2010 annual conference, he confirmed that, sadly, his warning proved correct. In one Garda division alone, numbers were down by 20 in the recent months. He also pointed out at that conference that, disgracefully, there were no students in the Garda college for the first time in its history and that due to government policy, there would be no students in the college for a long time to come. He went on to say that An Garda Síochána was contracting due to the direct action of the government, that experience was being driven out and no new blood was coming in and that this was pushing the force to the brink of disaster. What was the Fianna Fáil response to this? Its current justice spokesperson, Deputy Niall Collins, called for the outgoing president of the GRA, Michael O'Boyce, to be removed from the force by the then Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy. The current Government is implementing Fianna Fáil’s 2010 national recovery plan when it comes to Garda cuts, the deal Fianna Fáil negotiated with the troika. Fianna Fáil agreed with the troika to cut Garda numbers from 14,500 that year to 13,500 the following year and to 13,000 in 2014, a total drop of 10%. Its plan also stated that there would be €25 million in savings from unspecified Garda management efficiencies and €140 million savings in overtime, allowances and transport costs, much of it within the force. Is the public expected to believe that Fianna Fáil has now seen the error of its ways? Increasing Garda strength could have been achieved by continuing the process of civilianising Garda administrative services to international standards. This would also have created valuable local employment for civilians. In a 2007 report, Policing in Ireland - Looking Forward, the Garda inspectorate found that in many instances small rural stations were serviced by one officer, answering to a district headquarters, but mostly operating alone without ready access to supervisors, an official car or Garda IT systems. The inspectorate recommended the implementation of a consistent rural policing model that enhances visibility and makes best use of Garda resources in serving local communities. A centralised Garda service will increase rural isolation and undermine the people's sense of security in their homes. There is increasing evidence that police station closures can lead to an increase in crime. In England, where rural services have seen similar cutbacks in police services, crime figures have surged. Violent crime rose by 119% in country areas between 1988 and 1989 and 2006 and 2007 compared with a national increase of 108% that year.  I met the Assistant Garda Commissioner, Kieran Kenny, in Donegal last week, after the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, withdrew from talks on the extension of the Croke Park agreement, saying it would not tolerate further cuts in pay. The reason I, along with my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, asked to meet the Assistant Commissioner, was to discuss policing in Donegal, where attacks on old people in their homes have caused devastation to their lives and worry and stress to their families. In some cases, such attacks have forced older people to leave the homes they have lived in all their lives. I received assurances An Garda Síochána has taken steps to combat these attacks in Donegal. A specific operation, operation LEAH, has been put in place, providing extra personnel and resources to the area. The Assistant Commissioner reported that 11 arrests have been made on both sides of the Border and some stolen property has been recovered.This kind of Garda operation should be the norm, rather than the exception, all over the State. It should not take a crisis, like that which happened in County Donegal, for the force to be properly resourced. I commend the gardaí in County Donegal on their actions. They should not have had to wait for 11 aggravated burglaries to happen before the Government gave them the resources to address these crimes. If one speaks to gardaí in any part of the State, they will tell one that they fear they can no longer provide a service to the public. Both representative organisations recognise the seriousness of the situation. The news that another 100 Garda stations are to close is a serious blow to rural Ireland as well as to some urban communities which have already suffered disproportionately under the cuts regime imposed by this Government and its predecessor. This savage attack will also see certain rural Garda districts being amalgamated into 14 districts as part of an effort to centralise in urban areas the policing of huge swathes of rural Ireland. Perhaps this aspect of the Government's plans has been overlooked because of the focus on Garda station closures. The amalgamation and centralisation of rural policing in more urban areas is also a big challenge. The Irish Farmers Association, which represents rural Ireland, and the Garda Representative Association, which represents the vast majority of gardaí, have repeatedly rejected these ongoing station closures. Unlike those who were in charge of drafting the Government's proposals, those involved with the two associations know rural communities and appreciate the value of community policing. According to an IFA survey, more than 10% of farmers have been victims of crime. The challenge of trying to square police statistics for reported crime with surveys showing that many people do not report more minor crimes is being faced internationally. It should not be the case that people are not willing to report crime, but sadly it is. It means that official statistics do not give us an accurate reflection of the true levels of crime. That is an international phenomenon and an issue in Ireland. The Government has been attempting to spin its reform of policing structures, but we all know that the austerity agenda is at work under the mask of reform. This work was commenced under Fianna Fáil and it is being continued. Fianna Fáil has a brass neck to have tabled this motion tonight. Deputy Niall Collins has been around politics a while. He knows it very well. Nobody has been fooled by this motion. The facts speak for themselves. We recall what happened when the then president of the Garda Representative Association, Michael O'Boyce, spoke the truth. When the then Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, was presented with a draft of the speech by Mr. O'Boyce he decided not to bother showing up at the association's annual event. He was unwilling to take the heat and deal with the implications of the decisions his Government had taken over the previous two years. Just two years have passed since Mr. O'Boyce delivered his speech. I do not believe the people of this country are suffering from some kind of collective amnesia, they have a clear memory. Fianna Fáil has shown that it is determined to go ahead with the debate on this motion over the next two days, despite the Minister and the Government calling on it not to do so. I agree with them on this occasion. This motion will fool nobody and will achieve nothing for Fianna Fáil. The debate on the important issue of Garda resources will be diminished as a result of Fianna Fáil's decision to force this motion to a vote tomorrow evening.	spk_402

However, it is a poor reflection on society that it is necessary in the first place. Up-to-date legislation is long overdue. The last guidelines on countering bullying in schools were circulated in 1993. School in 2013 is a different place from 1993 when the phrase ""cyberbullying"" would have been meaningless. It is imperative that our guidelines are updated to ensure technologies that were not around then do not slip through the net. We must not underestimate the effects of persistent bullying through Facebook and other fora. The media have highlighted the tragedies in which bullying was associated with teenage suicides and we have experienced a number of these in my own county, Donegal, in the recent past. No child should ever feel so bullied that the only way to end the trauma is to end his or her own life. As legislators, we have a responsibility to ensure we do everything within our capability to prevent bullying from occurring in the first place. However, there is a wider issue regarding legislators. We have often heard Deputies pontificate in the Chamber on the issue of bullying and who have then felt comfortable making pronouncements on the way in which other Deputies dress. It is not only hypocritical, it is unacceptable. Furthermore, Deputies have affirmed their commitment to ending homophobic and transphobic bullying, yet they have refused to make a statement on or push to introduce same-sex marriage. I particularly welcome the comments by the US President, Barack Obama, in his inauguration speech, who has taken a lead on this issue. Hopefully, others will follow not just across the US but across the world. If all citizens are equal, that must be reflected in all aspects of our society and law. That is the strongest message we can send. With regard to the broader issue of sexuality and gender equality, the lack of equality for certain groups goes to the core of why homophobic and transphobic bullying is viewed as acceptable in certain quarters of society. It is heartening that the Minister is open to updating anti-bullying guidelines in schools, but Members should also lead by example and fight all the underlying issues that lend themselves to bullying in general. There was a furore recently when Julie Burchill made transphobic comments in  It is up to everyone to speak out when they witness bullying, whether it is in the school yard, council chambers or the newspapers. I urge all Members to support the Bill. If Members are happy with the essentials in the Bill, I urge them to allow it to go forward to be amended on Committee Stage, if needs be. It is too important to become a victim of petty party politicking. All of us should be able to get behind the fundamental principles underpinning the legislation to safeguard children and assist principals, teachers and staff. Many Members are parents of school-going children and will understand its importance. We all have a responsibility as public representatives to ensure what we do and the actions we engage in are an inspiration and guide and a light shone on the path for the next generation. Some of the comments made by public representatives over the past week, including in my home county about Travellers, were shameful, bigoted and racist and it is no wonder they filter down to children in schools."	spk_502

We have amended it so that none of the representatives of the various organisations listed would be paid for their services. They would represent the organisations in partnership. The reason we have tabled the amendment is because while overall we do not have any particular objection to the existing board being closed down and brought back under the aegis of the Department of Defence, as it was previously, we have some concerns. The first of these is that within the existing board is a range of expertise, including the County and City Managers Association, representing local authorities throughout the State which administer Civil Defence and ensure the necessary personnel are on the ground and fully trained and able to respond to an emergency; the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, which is also emergency related; the Environmental Protection Agency; representatives of Civil Defence officers; the Defence Forces; and the Garda Síochána. It is key that within the new arrangements in the Department of Defence there is a dedicated structure which retains all of this expertise and analyses the overall Civil Defence plan to ensure it is fit for purpose. The other amendment I have tabled deals with resources. In the existing criteria every local authority must put together a plan which it submits to the Civil Defence board in which the local authority outlines its priorities and strategies. A funding allocation is then made to the local authority. The difficulty now is that there does not appear to be within the Bill any clear criteria for how the Minister would deploy his or her resources. I appreciate it is made clear in the Bill that €70,000, which is not a huge sum of money, is being saved by this. No cut is being made to the budget. The difficulty in this area is that there are a lot of cutbacks to local authorities, including huge changes to their budgets and consequently how they operate. It is very important that on an ongoing basis resources are there for training and re-training to deal with new techniques, equipment and health and safety processes. We want to ensure that all the strengths continue in operation. All of us are immensely proud of the work done by the Civil Defence teams. In the bad winter, from late 2010 to early 2011, County Donegal had freezing conditions for a sustained period of two months, as did the rest of the country. I was the chairperson of the roads and transport committee on Donegal County Council at the time. It was a case of putting all shoulders to the wheel, including the farming organisations. The Defence Forces were called out to inaccessible places and it was a remarkable team effort in which the Civil Defence played a key role. I am sure the Minister of State could cite as many such stories also, and he has been longer in politics than I have. We must continue to resource and value the professionalism and dedication of these local men and women. We need to continue availing of their range of skills. Apart from that, we do not have any difficulties with the principle of the Bill."	spk_246

Such criteria no longer appear to be in place for the Minister and the Department.

It is very much appreciated. This is obviously very important legislation, particularly in the context of the passing of the referendum on children and the belated accepting of responsibility by the State on these matters. We still have a long way to go but this is definitely a step in the right direction and a reassurance to the public that lessons are being learned. An issue I wish to raise is that of spent convictions and I ask the Minister to consider further this matter and perhaps review how it progresses in time. The Minister wrote to me in October and stated it was his intention to streamline the interface between the two Bills to ensure they worked together harmoniously. We need to move forward with the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 in the year ahead and when we do so inevitable issues will arise. I read the transcript of the exchange between the Minister and my colleague Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh in which the Minister acknowledged the difficult balancing act involved in protecting the interests of children when including soft information. Sinn Féin supports this because the main priority is the protection of children. When we come to deal with the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 there may be issues to reconsider and it may be an opportunity to examine whether we can dovetail both pieces of legislation and ensure maximum protection. I ask the Minister to examine this. I saw from the exchange in the Seanad he is reflecting on it and will continue to do so, and I wanted to raise it at this point to ask that the Minister consider it again when we commence the next process which is somewhat related to this.	spk_282

This is essential to ensure people are not driven into poverty. A consensual budgeting standards mechanism aims to develop a standard that is rooted in social consensus about goods and services that everyone can afford. The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice has used this in much of its research and the methodology itself works using focus groups of people from differing socioeconomic backgrounds to identify the actual expenditure choices and judgments that are made by people in real life as well as how they manage their money. The mechanism establishes the cost of a minimum essential standard of living across lifecycles and covers a broad range of age groups, while also providing a more comprehensive picture of the needs of groups such as single adults of working age living alone, etc. Further to this, Sinn Féin also is calling for the insolvency service to examine geographic locations. Cost of living will vary depending on location and those who live in rural areas with no access to public transport will find it more difficult to get to work, bring children to school and so on in respect of transport costs. Sinn Féin welcomes that the Minister has defined more clearly what constitutes a reasonable standard of living. However, I ask him to consider the two amendments I have tabled.

I have determined this from consultation with people about the matter. Will the Minister consider the matter further, although I appreciate that he has come some distance? Nevertheless, €750 is not a realistic valuation for the typical item of jewellery of ceremonial importance. It is an important matter, although there has been a bit of fun with this in the media. We must complete a Bill that strikes a balance between satisfying those who are owed money and not humiliating those who are unfortunate enough not to be able to repay debts. To leave a provision for a person's wedding ring to be taken from that person as part of the process would lead to humiliation. We must get to a valuation that is more realistic in reflecting the average value out there and I argue that €1,500 is much closer to that than €750."	spk_388

Deputy Healy-Rae has conveyed the difference between urban and rural mindsets. I appreciate that the Minister has moved some ways and pushed the value of the item of ceremonial importance to €750. In fairness, he also pushed the vehicle's valuation to €2,000. I welcome this. He may believe we are being churlish in our amendments, but he knows the typical engagement ring purchased in the past decade would rarely have cost as little as €750. I appreciate that a Deputy provided him with a valuation. I was alarmed when I heard it. I do not want the Minister to believe this is a token amendment. It is a practical measure that reflects the reality of the value of people's engagement and wedding rings. No one involved in the process wants to see legislation the practical interpretation of which permits someone's engagement ring to be taken. We will press the amendment if the Minister does not accept it. Clearly, the Government will win this debate, given the numbers in the House, but I ask the Minister to reflect on the question put to him by Deputy Niall Collins. There may be an opportunity to amend this measure at a later stage if he cannot do so today. The second issue is that of the car valuation. The Minister used the term ""luxury"". I agree with Deputy Healy-Rae, in that having a vehicle in rural Ireland is no luxury. If one lives in rural parts of the Inishowen Peninsula or in north or west County Donegal, public transport will rarely pass one's way during the day. If one wants to have a job or participate in the life of the community in any meaningful way, one must have a car. I appreciate that the Minister has moved towards €2,000, as it is a step in the right direction. The State benefits from VRT. Against all European directives, we choose to have a high VRT rate, increasing the cost of our cars. What one would get for £1,000 in the North differs greatly from what one would get for €1,200 in this State. My amendment reflects reality. With all due respect, we are rural people and we know a basic car or vehicle, to take Deputy Healy-Rae's point on board, is necessary to survive in areas where the public transport system of many years is now absent. All the Minister needs to do is ask one of his rural colleagues what constitutes a basic car for the people in question. I appreciate what the Minister has stated. A local business, credit union or so on will seek to strike a balance; no one wants people to be humiliated. The people under discussion are in financial hardship. Through this amendment, we want those in rural Ireland in particular to have the chance to return to the world of work. Our amendments are practical and are not intended to disrespect the fact that the Minister has taken on board our points. I commend him in that regard, as he has not maintained a stubborn position. I appreciate the ring valuation came from an Opposition Member's recommendation. In the Minister's heart of hearts, though, he knows he probably has not gone far enough with either valuation. He may, however, insist on not accepting these amendments.Will he at least offer an assurance that he will review these matters in the near future, in the context of his ministerial rights under the legislation?"	spk_407

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-12-19	dail	31	Personal Insolvency Bil 2012: From the Seanad (Resumed)	dbsect_31	I commend Deputy Donnelly for raising this matter and, in fairness, he has raised it throughout the process. The concern is that we would not have a situation whereby the bankruptcy period would be reduced in real effect. There is also concern about a bank veto and opposition amendments have been tabled to try to curtail that, but they have been resisted. I have had a chance to read over some of the comments made by Ray MacSharry and his colleague Margaret Hayes who are public interest directors with Permanent TSB. For the record, they have been paid €510,000 in fees since 2008. It is a hell of a lot of money to represent the public interest. I am shocked at what Deputy Donnelly has reported and what I have just read about these comments. It goes against all the debate we have had on debt forgiveness in Irish society in recent years. The Government has had an objective to deal with this issue. Deputy Donnelly has spoken at length about this area of huge concern to people. Not having a reduction in the period of bankruptcy is a very punishing system in this State.  I presume this Bill will be passed tonight and will go to the President for his stamp of approval. We will then need to reassure the public that at last there is some mechanism or process in place for people who were not reckless and believed what they saw in the media from their political leaders, economists and estate agents - that there would be a soft landing if anything went wrong. At the time, they were encouraged to purchase a home and invest. We now know that 24% of home owners are in mortgage distress. It involves approximately 180,000 families and individuals so we have a real crisis on our hands and this Bill is part of the response to that. It is critical, however, that the message comes from Government that if the banks and other financial institutions abuse any element of this legislation to prevent genuine debt forgiveness to families in that situation, the Government will immediately move - as quickly as it pushed through the family home tax legislation last night with a guillotine - to address that issue. While we have serious concerns, and Deputy Donnelly has outlined his concerns also, we hope the impact of this legislation is to make a difference. Nonetheless, the arrogant comments of Ray MacSharry and Richie Boucher are acting against the public interest. I do not need to remind the Minister that these financial institutions are now under the control of the Irish people, so there needs to be a bit of humility particularly among public interest directors. My final point throws the whole matter into sharp focus. The Law Reform Commission held an event last week at which one of the main points of focus concerned corporate responsibility and legislation in the area of white collar crime. There were some really interesting contributions. At the end, the eminent national and international experts were asked to define the role of public interest directors and what they have achieved. It was clear from the responses that they were not quite sure. Ultimately, however, they appeared to be still acting in the interests of the banks and their shareholders, even though that is not what they are paid to do.  I appreciate the Minister's immediate response to these comments. He has not had a chance to look at the transcript, but I would invite him to examine those comments. When the legislation is passed, he should act immediately to reassure the public that those outrageous comments are rebuked and confronted. Reassurance should be given that if banks seek to abuse this legislation and do not meet their responsibilities to give people a chance of debt resolution, the Government will move extremely swiftly - as swiftly as it did with the property or family home tax yesterday - to address whatever arises and put this thing straight.  One of the biggest challenges facing our people over the next generation involves mortgage distress, debt resolution and debt forgiveness for families who need a chance to move on. I appreciate that a huge amount of work and deliberation has gone into this legislation. Deputy Niall Collins and I have sat through all of the debate with the Minister. We have serious concerns and if they are quickly vindicated, I urge the Minister to reassure the public swiftly. We cannot have all the work and goodwill that has gone into this legislation torn apart by people who are acting against the interests of the Irish people, yet who are, unbelievably, being paid by the public.	spk_454

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-12-05	dail	31	Financial Resolution No. 14: Capital Acquisitions Tax	dbsect_37	We have concerns about Financial Resolutions Nos. 10 and 11. These will allow the Government to tax savings and use the revenue to pay for the promissory note. We need to encourage people to put those savings into the economy. We will vote against those resolutions. With regard to Financial Resolutions Nos. 13 and 14, Sinn Féin proposed a 10% increase in capital gains and capital acquisitions tax, moving the rate from 30% to 40%. We proposed to reduce the tax-free threshold by 25%. In total, from the estimation of the Department of Finance, this would have raised over €300 million. According to colleagues on my left, the Department only contains amateurs and clowns, and we should disregard any opinion given by the Department in replies to parliamentary questions. Apparently, when parliamentary questions are asked and Departments give a response, they can only be amateurish and the work of clowns.	spk_747
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-12-05	dail	31	Financial Resolution No. 14: Capital Acquisitions Tax	dbsect_37	It is a desperate chorus of people who were clearly defeated by Fine Gael in negotiations when that party clearly defended the interests of the wealthy. Fine Gael could have considered the reality on the ground and done much more. The Labour Party lost out but rather than acknowledging that it did not get what it wanted in negotiations and the wealthy have been protected overall, we hear nonsense from members about how Department of Finance feedback is not reliable or the way to do business. Nobody will buy that absolute nonsense outside the House. We will support Financial Resolutions Nos. 12 to 14, inclusive, begrudgingly. There was an opportunity to raise more than €300 million but the Government will raise approximately €100 million. The figure in question - roughly the same as what will be brought about by the property tax - could have been achieved by asking the wealthy to pay their share, thus undoing the damage done by Champagne Charlie when he was around. This is all about choices and winning negotiations. The Labour Party lost to Fine Gael but it should not blame us or the Department of Finance when it provides answers to questions, as it is required to in our Irish democracy.	spk_750

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-12-04	dail	31	Funding of Disability Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_36	"The removal of the Christmas double payments also heavily impacted on the disabled and their families and carers. All of this meant that Fianna Fáil cut the income of disabled people and their carers by 10% over two budgets. A brass neck indeed. It is no wonder that Fianna Fáil's spokesperson on social protection and Minister in that Government, Deputy O'Dea, was heckled and booed by disability rights campaigners who were protesting outside the Dáil a few weeks ago. That Fianna Fáil Government also cruelly slashed funding to voluntary organisations working with the disabled as well as front-line services to the disabled across the State. We witnessed savage cuts to the number of special needs assistants, SNAs, resulting in children with disabilities staying outside of mainstream schools. Was it not the Fianna Fáil Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who told primary school teachers that resource teachers for children with learning disabilities would be withdrawn if they had less than nine children in each of their schools? That was in 2009, when the then Fine Gael education spokesperson, Deputy Brian Hayes, issued a statement calling it an ""attack"" on children with learning disabilities. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was the then Labour Party spokesperson on disability and called for services for children with intellectual disabilities to be protected. It is remarkable how Fine Gael and the Labour Party have changed their views on all of these matters in their alliance for austerity. The motion ""recognises"" that there are more than 600,000 people with disabilities in the State and ""recognises"" their concern regarding cuts to services. It merely ""notes"" the pledges in the programme for Government and calls on the Government to provide the appropriate funding and services to honour ""all"" commitments to people with disabilities. It is not unreasonable to ask what Fianna Fáil mean by ""all"" in this motion. Does it include that party's own commitments to people with disabilities that it failed to uphold in spectacular fashion? As Members of this House, we must ensure that a threshold of decency on disability supports is developed. There must be a political consensus that people with disabilities will have their dignity and rights maintained and their families will not be abandoned as a result of ongoing cutbacks. Recently, we have seen images of citizens with profound disabilities who protested outside Leinster House at the cuts introduced by the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly. They struck a powerful chord with the Irish people. The courage and dignity of those who braved the elements to make their stand shone a light on the reality that, despite the promises of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in the final pre­election leaders' debate last year, their Government has proceeded to enforce cut after cut on those with disabilities, their families and their carers. Their broken promises on disabilities are the cruellest of all. If this Government took a Kango hammer and tore up our roads, there would be uproar, but that is exactly what it has been doing to support services for people with disabilities. Nine leading disability organisations spoke out on this scandal, yet the Government has still done nothing. We should make no mistake about this. Given Fianna Fáil's record in this area, it would not be acting any differently were it still in government. The disability organisations have outlined a vision for people with disabilities and called on the Government to take urgent action on three key areas. First, halt reductions in the basic standard of living of people with disabilities requiring welfare supports. People with disabilities are most likely to experience real poverty because, on top of the recent cuts in benefit levels and new charges, they must also continue to pay for extras required due to their disabilities. They are among some of the most vulnerable groups that will lay awake tonight in fear at what fresh hell tomorrow's budget will bring. Second, funding must be guaranteed to the services needed by people with disabilities. Cutting the services required by people with disabilities not only undermines their lives, but also leads to a growing public expenditure in terms of hospital stays and expensive care costs. It does not make economic, let alone ethical, sense to cut their services. Third, it is a matter of urgency that the Government publish an ambitious implementation plan for the national disability strategy in keeping with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities so that people can have dignity, individual autonomy and full and effective participation in Irish society. People's faith in Ireland's eventual recovery depends not just on economic measures. Social protection for all people through this long, stressful period needs to be central to the Government's recovery plans. Government actions must address social inclusion and cohesion. Recent Government cuts have heightened these concerns in the run up to the budget. Sinn Féin fully endorses the people's call and we call on the Government to take up this challenge and honour its promises to our most vulnerable citizens. Last year, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, announced proposals to stop disability payments to new claimants aged between 16 and 18 years. That measure was halted after people took to the streets. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, let the Minister for Social Protection take the fall, famously describing how they would ""revisit"" the matter. We must wait and see what will be ""revisited"" in the coming months. As far as this motion is concerned, I welcome Fianna Fáil's Pauline conversion to the fight for disability rights. We can legitimately question the motivations behind it, but we support the right to full equality for people with disabilities. The previous Government cut the income of people with disabilities and their carers by 10% across two budgets. The impact is still being felt. The people in question are some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in the State. Community employment schemes, social welfare and so on impact on them. We need to put action behind the rhetoric. It is time for a threshold of decency on this issue.I repeat my call to all parties, despite their previous and ongoing record, to examine the issue. What citizen, on being informed by elected Members that we would make an all-party, all-grouping consensus that no matter what happens we would not make further cuts to disabled people, their carers and families but we would maintain a threshold of decency, would disagree with the proposal? The issue is how we get to that stage. There has been a shameful history of failure to meet our obligations to citizens with disabilities in recent years. Perhaps we could start to reverse that, treat them as equal partners and give them their rights once and for all."	spk_489
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-11-29	dail	31	Civil Defence Bill 2012 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_18	While Sinn Féin is not opposed to allowing the Civil Defence Bill 2012 to proceed to Committee Stage, it has some concerns about the impact the Bill will have on the functioning and management of Civil Defence. The Civil Defence board, as constituted, represents a broad balance of interests, from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Garda, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the emergency services. There should be no doubt about the value of their input into how Civil Defence functions and, whatever changes are made to the body in this or other legislation, a mechanism must be included to ensure it can draw on the valuable expertise and opinions of these other groups. If the Bill is passed in its current form and the property and assets are transferred back to the Department of Defence, the result will be a mere €60,000 in savings. This is a very tiny amount in budgetary terms but not to be sniffed at. An extra €60,000 allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to a women's refuge would make all the difference in terms of how it could provide a service for vulnerable women and child victims of domestic violence. The point is that there is no value in proceeding with legislation on the basis that it will save €60,000 if the lack of expertise on the previous board becomes an issue. If a cost-benefit analysis of the impact of this lack of expertise demonstrates that it will cost more in the long term, obviously, it will not be worth continuing. On that basis, Sinn Féin is examining the legislation to ensure expertise is not lost in the restructuring of the Civil Defence board. I take the opportunity to commend the work of Civil Defence - the ordinary people across Ireland who do extraordinary things acting in a voluntary capacity as members of communities. I saw this myself in my own home county of Donegal during the spell of severe weather in late 2010-early 2011 when we had snow and freezing cold weather conditions for a sustained period of two months. Civil Defence was deployed to assist the emergency services in keeping everything going. Its members are trained to professional standards and can be called upon at any time to volunteer in emergencies. They do great work and no change should be made that will have a negative impact on their ability to do it. We must maintain the resources and supports available to them. We have a further concern that the parameters for funding are being changed. What was a responsibility of the local authorities is being transferred to within the Minister's discretion and funding could be cut. I should say this was a responsibility of the Civil Defence board in how it allocated moneys to local authorities, for which there are clear parameters and criteria in place. This will now be done at the Minister's discretion and the fear is that, in the context of ongoing cuts in local authorities, they may not be allocated the necessary resources to support Civil Defence activities in their respective areas. We must receive assurances from the Minister that funding will be maintained for Civil Defence training programmes and activities, as appropriate. I am also conscious that, while Civil Defence acts in support of the Defence Forces and the emergency services in dealing with the effects of flooding and heavy snowfalls, the Government is engaging in a serious programme of cutbacks within the Defence Forces.That in itself will lead to its own problems, but we must not allow a situation to develop where the Civil Defence ends up being the fall-back plan when it comes to emergency service provision because the Government has hammered away at it with its cutbacks agenda. As I said to Minister about the Reserve Defence Forces and the changes in that regard, a mistake was made in not giving adequate time to the representative association to respond and make an input before the so-called value for money report was agreed and published. I do not doubt the Minister of State has the same value and respect for the Reserve Defence Forces and the Civil Defence as I have. It is not about that; it is about involving those affected in the change and the decision-making process. It is clear from the feedback we are getting from the Reserve Defence Forces that they are annoyed about that. I call on the Minister of State to involve the Civil Defence members’ representative association and to invite suggested amendments or ideas from it on the Bill as it moves through Committee Stage. I will do that, but I urge the Minister of State to do the same to ensure that we protect the integrity of everything that has happened to date. We must continue to resource the Civil Defence and give its members the necessary training because they are very proud of what they do. We must continue to facilitate active citizenship. The Minister of State and I both know members of the Civil Defence. They are wonderful people who have a sense of community commitment. They want to do more than the average citizen in terms of contributing and being a backup to the Permanent Defence Force and the emergency services. The key issues are to ensure that the balance of skills currently available to the Civil Defence Board is maintained in the new arrangements, and that there is an advisory stakeholder role in the future management of the service by the Department. Local authorities must continue to be resourced by the Minister. I ask the Minister of State to give an assurance that will be the case and that the Civil Defence will have what it requires to support its activities. Participation in the Reserve Defence Forces and the Civil Defence are in the main voluntary contributions to community and society by some of our finest citizens. We must show in actions as well as words that we value the contribution and partnership they offer and that we will continue to resource them properly.	spk_167

I appealed to him to have another look at the submission made by the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, back in 2010 and the innovative proposals within that before a final decision would be made. I am outraged to learn the representatives of the Reserve Defence Force were given just hours to prepare a response to this 110 page document, although they had been assured they would have at least a week to make a response. As a result, they have not endorsed the report or the recommendations. What is to happen? Essentially, the Government is going to halve the budget for the Reserve Defence Force and halve the numbers within it. As the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, knows, rural parishes throughout the State will lose their outposts, which are being centralised to a number of locations and main camps.

Most important, they help young people to establish a civic and patriotic connection with the country. It is a huge tragedy that the Minister has decided to agree to a so-called value for money report that saves €11 million. I will outline to the Minister of State how €11 million could be saved based on Sinn Féin's budget proposals. The Government would save €11 million if it cut payments to political appointees to State boards by 25%, cut the salaries of Ministers to €100,000 per annum and cut the salaries of Deputies to €75,000. The Government has a choice. It could halve the resource of the Reserve Defence Force, take away the connection with local communities across the State, and radically deplete the mostly civic and voluntary service that gives considerable value for money - despite the recommendations in the report - or it could cut the pay of political appointees, Ministers and Deputies. It is all about choices and that is what the Minister has chosen to do. That is a disgraceful way to treat the representatives of the Reserve Defence Force.

I have no doubt it will bring many issues to the attention of the Minister which he has not considered. A grave mistake has been made in haste after such a long process in an attempt to publish the report and go for the headline figure of halving the budget. The mistake that has been made is that disrespect has been shown to those who serve us and the organisation representing them and we must see whether we can change some of the decisions and address the concerns of members of the Reserve Defence Force. I appeal to the Minister of State to address the issue."	spk_422

The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, addressed them. I will reiterate my points for future consideration. There needs to be co-operation at European level in terms of tackling criminal gangs. Yesterday, the Garda Commissioner appeared before the committee to discuss the Garda's work in Ireland and at European level in this regard. We have concerns about the protection of human rights, respect for Irish law and the sovereignty of our police service in joint investigation teams. We have not tabled further amendments because we were reassured about these issues on Committee Stage. I hope that, as the work continues, the Minister will be mindful of our concerns, but we are happy to support the Bill.	spk_174

The thousands of people who took to the streets in the freezing cold on Saturday to demand the Government introduce legislation for the X case should not have had to be there. They should not have had to march through the streets of Dublin and Galway and hold vigils in towns around Ireland to make their voices heard when they said ""never again"". The Irish people who stand outside Irish embassies in the United States, Berlin, Vienna and London should not be there. I do not disregard the divisiveness of the broader issue of abortion rights and access in Ireland. I believe in Christian values, values and teachings that are about love, compassion, respect and empathy. These are values that are not just central to me in life but also in how I conduct myself as a person elected to represent the people of my constituency. My party's policy, as repeatedly agreed by our membership, is in line with those values. Sinn Féin is not in favour of abortion. We believe all possible means of education and support services should be in place. However, in cases of rape, incest and sexual abuse, or in which a woman's life and mental health are at risk or in grave danger, Sinn Féin accepts the final decision should rest with the woman concerned. There are those who would argue against allowing abortion in the circumstances of rape and while, for them, it is an issue of conscience, rape and sexual crimes are one of the greatest violations a man can commit against a woman. Short of killing her, there is possibly nothing worse a person could do to a woman. It is a heinous crime. I could not and I would not ask any woman to bear the child of her rapist. The Rape Crisis Network of Ireland released statistics that showed in 2010 that 75 women who were pregnant as a result of rape used their services. Due to the nature of under-reporting of sexual crime, the real figure of women who found themselves in that situation is probably much higher. The organisation stated:The RCNI would have concerns that any rape survivor would be subject to restrictions and would have to travel oversees to another jurisdiction in order to access a termination.[...] Rape Crisis Centres will continue to support survivors in making decisions which survivors feel are the right choices for their circumstances.This is the key point. What is the right choice in their circumstance? If abortion was to be allowed in those circumstances, no person would be compelled to have one. Even church teachings hold a deep regard for an individual's conscience and, when discussing the matter of a woman who is pregnant as a result of rape, whose conscience takes priority? Is it the woman, a rape victim, seeking the procedure or the legislators who must provide a legal framework for her to access it? This is a discussion that I can see taking place further down the road. Like the grounds for the X case, it is something that we will end up revisiting. With regard to the motion, it is very simple. The people have spoken and it is time for the Government to introduce legislation for the X case. The Government amendment to our motion simply notes that the expert group is examining the matter and it will propose a range of options as to how the Government should respond to the ""complex and sensitive issues"". Convening the expert group was a cop-out on the part of the Government, which knows that legislation has been needed since 1992 when the Supreme Court judgment in the X case was handed down. This was reiterated by the European Court of Human Rights in 2010 when it delivered judgment in the A, B and C  Rather than giving a clear commitment to legislate for the X case, we hear from Government representatives a more nuanced position of calling for legal clarity. We must be clear that a statutory instrument will not suffice; this matter requires primary legislation. If a statutory instrument is produced, Government Members know it will be subject to legal challenge but it may be an opportunity to put off the inevitable - legislating - for just a little longer. Over the past week my inbox has been filled with e-mails from people from my constituency demanding not that something be done about it but making a clear demand that we must legislate for the X case. The motion calls for legislation to provide women with access to abortions in cases where there is a risk to their lives. That is not to indulge in hyperbole. We must make no mistake that it is about life and death situations. No pregnant woman in Ireland should ever have to worry that, if something goes wrong in her pregnancy, she will be faced with a medical practitioner who refuses her the necessary treatment because of a legal vacuum that legislators in this House have stood over for 20 years. Women should know that if their lives are in danger, they will be saved and doctors should know that if a woman's life is in danger, they can treat her appropriately. I have heard people say, throughout the course of the debate, that there is no medical condition in which a pregnant woman needs an abortion to save her life. While I am conscious there is an inquiry into the death of Savita Halappanavar, I respectfully suggest her grieving husband Praveen would beg to differ on that point and the husband of Sheila Hodgers may agree with him. The death of Savita Halappanavar has shocked and saddened people throughout Ireland. It has underlined in the most tragic way possible the need for long overdue legislation in the State. The Government has stated its intention to bring forward legislation but successive Governments have failed to deal with the issue for 20 years. It is time, finally, for legislation to protect the rights of women as decided by the Supreme Court in 1992. This should be done in a reasoned, tolerant and considered manner and with maximum cross-party consensus. On this basis, Sinn Féin has tabled a Dáil motion that seeks, in a measured and reasoned way, to get our Government to act and to fulfil its responsibilities so that appalling situations, such as that which led to the death of Savita, can never happen in this country again."	spk_314

That is almost identical to the amount allowed in the Bill. The road network in the North is superior to that in many areas of rural Ireland, where one needs a reasonable car. I can only speak with knowledge of my own constituency of Donegal North East. In the rural areas of my constituency, one could not sustain a family, have a reasonable opportunity of attaining employment or deal with the necessities of family life without having a car. There is no public transport infrastructure.  I accept that we are trying to strike a balance. I said so last night. We have all been lobbied by credit unions and we know stories of small businesses that are unable to pay their employees because they have not been paid by their customers. I accept that a balance must be found. However, I urge the Minister to reconsider the figure of €1,200. It will not allow someone to have a car that would sustain a family in vast swathes of rural Ireland.  There may be a mid-way point. Perhaps €2,000 would be a reasonable figure. I ask the Minister to reflect on this issue. Some basic consultation with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, might help to strike a reasonable balance between the rights of a creditor and the needs of a family who have gone through an exhaustive process and demonstrated that they do not have the capacity to pay their debts. We want people to meet their responsibilities but we do not want to humiliate them.	spk_184

It should not assist commercial investors. The reference in the Bill to debts exceeding €3 million is intended to capture buy-to-let landlords. The ECB, the IMF and a range of academic experts argued that this is too high and must be lowered. A sum of €1 million is sufficient to capture all of those with significant personal debt. This is one of the core issues in the Bill we have a problem with and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.	spk_466

The public's view is that this legislation is a compassionate response to a swathe of people who purchased homes and took on debt in good faith. They listened to politicians and economists, so called experts, and took that plunge. The banks, as we all know, had the moral hazard, from the bank manager to the boards of directors. We agree that this Bill would allow for a compassionate response that would enable people in those circumstances to get themselves out of this situation. Today we were told we must be tough and think about the creditors, we must keep the car value down and the engagement ring must come from a lucky bag. All of a sudden, however, we must be more compassionate for those who were investing and who took on board much more than the vast majority of people did to put a roof over their heads.	spk_470

The objective of the Bill is to work through that section of our people who are in mortgage distress or other debt as a result of this crisis. In addition, the legislation tries to find a compassionate balance between their responsibilities, as well as understanding the unique circumstances and environment that led to where they find themselves today. We do not want to give banks the ability to stonewall. We want this legislation to benefit as many families in distress as possible. That is what this series of amendments try to do. I would particularly urge the Minister to consider the amendment before us. We want to send a message out to creditors that they do not have a veto, or the capacity not to engage constructively in this process. We want to give people hope, so we do not wish to have an imbalance at the start of the process as people in distress engage with this and try to work their way through it. The difficulty in terms of the numbers the Minister has put in place is that they do give a veto, which is not right.	spk_539

Specifically, organisations such as the Free Legal Advice Centres have recommended that the applicable debt limit be increased to €30,000, as we propose here. As it stands, people who are fundamentally insolvent and with debts of between €20,000 and €30,000 will be forced to apply for a debt settlement arrangement. Such applications are likely to be rejected by way of creditor veto because the debtors concerned will have very little positive influence in terms of assets and so on to offer."	spk_331

If the threshold is increased from €20,000 to €30,000 the other thresholds must also be increased. The credit unions, FLAC and other interested parties have made representations to Deputies on the legislation as is their democratic right. They work on the ground at the coal face. Credit unions are unsecured lenders and they are concerned about the implications of the Bill for their community services. Somebody in the community has lent and the credit union has a responsibility to the community. I understand the point the Minister is making on setting a limit. I presume the free legal advice centres also speak from their direct experience on the ground and have not arbitrarily made up the figure of €30,000. People with more than the €20,000 threshold proposed in the Bill will have to choose another option, but other options will probably not be viable because of what those people have available to resolve their differences. The Minister would probably agree that it is a case of how long is a piece of string, but I ask him to consider this and review how the process works out as it is put in place in the coming years.	spk_433

If it is left in the hands of what could be an egregious debt resolution process to discuss an engagement ring or a wedding ring, one does not know what a creditor may wish to pursue in the course of that negotiation. We know that engagement rings do not cost €300 or €400; we are getting into thousands of euro in real terms. Unfortunately, those are the societal demands and expectations, so what value can one put on an engagement ring? One could explicitly say - and the way it is worded is spot on - that it is of ceremonial importance. Nobody wants anyone to lose their engagement ring or wedding ring, which is a treasured possession of a family. I urge the Minister to find some way whereby a creditor is not given licence to go after somebody's engagement ring or wedding ring. It is humiliating to have such a valued possession taken from a family.	spk_462

I am conscious that Deputies Niall Collins and Donnelly both represent considerable rural areas in their constituencies. I can only speak of County Donegal where, in vast swathes of the country, given the absence of an adequate public transport infrastructure, one must have a car to function as a family in real terms if one wishes to get by and to work. The imposition of a valuation of €1,200 on a vehicle is extremely limited and invites creditors to take a car that would be appropriate. I believe the terminology used in Deputy Niall Collins's amendment probably is a better way to phrase this than as a monetary value. A car that is appropriate to a family's needs could be taken from them and they could be obliged to get one that breaks down regularly. As for the limit of €1,200, as someone who has owned a car with such a valuation in County Donegal, I can assure the Minister that I often was stuck at the side of the road making telephone calls looking for someone to give me a tow and that is no way to get by. Consequently, I believe this is about common sense and coming to an arrangement that does not punish people, particularly in rural areas, or make life unbearable as this is not what Members are trying to achieve in this regard.	spk_481

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-10-04	dail	31	Europol Bill 2012: Second Stage	dbsect_7	"At the outset, I apologise to the Minister for missing the beginning of his speech, as I was delayed at the Disability Federation of Ireland's pre-budget discussion forum. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and while I welcome that it is mostly technical in nature and is intended to change the administrative status of Europol to bring it under the remit of the European Union, Sinn Féin will examine the Bill closely to ensure that it will serve to reinforce justice on a European level, rather than undermine it. In common with Interpol, Europol's primary focus is on intelligence-sharing between the law enforcement agencies of the EU member states. It also acts as a support service in this regard by providing technical advice and training, as well as co-ordinating technical and strategic co-operation between police services, including the exchange of information. Heretofore, however, it has not been accountable to the European Parliament - the European Court of Justice still has limited jurisdiction over its operations - but it is accountable to the European Union Council of Ministers through the Justice and Home Affairs Council. I hope this Bill has the capacity to rectify this position, as recommended in the Council decision. Sinn Féin is not opposed in principle to interjurisdictional police co-operation on investigation of serious crimes with a cross-border dimension, where such co-operation is authorised on a case-by-case basis, limited to the necessary and where there are appropriate safeguards and accountability mechanisms in place. Indeed, Sinn Féin strongly supports effective action against cross-border organised crime, including trafficking in human beings and drugs, especially where such action strikes the correct balance between the need and right of individuals and communities to be safe from predation with the civil rights of individuals. However, information lawfully obtained in the Irish jurisdictions should only be made available to and used by the authorities in another state for a legitimate purpose, that is, for the detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences that are analogous to offences within the Irish jurisdiction or for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to public safety in another state, provided that a criminal investigation subsequently is conducted. These are the circumstances under which Sinn Féin accepts it would be reasonable, responsible and in the public interest to share information with other police services. However the sharing of Garda or police intelligence should not happen for its own sake when there is no criminal Investigation and no immediate public threat as this potentially goes against the public good and violates the right to privacy. It is Sinn Féin's view that co-operation with Interpol, Europol or other interjurisdictional police co-operation on investigation of serious crimes with a cross-border dimension must be authorised on a case-by-case basis, limited to the necessary and must ensure there are appropriate safeguards and accountability mechanisms in place. Any information shared must be lawfully obtained and only made available to another state for a legitimate purpose, that is, for the detection, investigation or prosecution of analogous criminal offences. Moreover, there are serious questions to be asked regarding Europol in this area. It is undeniable that the EU has made incursions against our sovereignty over justice matters in the Twenty-six Counties, with power increasingly shifting over successive treaties from the member states to the EU. Sinn Féin is extremely mindful that a number of EU justice system features are being developed in addition to the current ones, namely, the European Court of Justice and Europol, that are more characteristic of a state or proto-state and which certainly are indicative of super-state ambitions. The aforementioned features include a common border control agency, a common immigration policy, a European public prosecutor and an incrementally harmonised and integrated justice system, including joint investigation teams and EU-wide arrest warrants. Most important, the requirement for unanimity between member states on all justice and interjurisdictional police matters has been progressively reduced. Indeed, justice and home affairs as it was known, was removed from the intergovernmental sphere and became an area of community law under the Lisbon treaty. Sinn Féin does not support the development of EU super-state architecture in respect of justice matters and for this reason it opposed the EU five-year justice and home affairs harmonisation plan known as the Hague programme, which ran from 2005 to 2010. The party does not support the creation of a so-called European Legal Area with a European criminal code and a European public prosecutor. Sovereignty over justice matters must remain firmly in the hands of the peoples of the EU member states. Beyond this, however, Sinn Féin has adopted a general policy of critical engagement on EU policies and legislative proposals. This means it is willing to support those it believes will be of benefit to the Irish people and to oppose those it believes will be detrimental. In deciding its position in respect of justice and home affairs matters, Sinn Féin examines any EU policy or proposal against the following critical engagement criteria. The policy or proposal is scrutinised on whether it respects or fundamentally compromise national sovereignty over justice, whether it advances or rolls back human rights protections and whether it is proportionate and necessary. Further criteria to be considered include whether it will enhance social and economic equality or whether its predictable effects are discriminatory, whether it respects or compromises the interests of smaller nations or minority groups within those nations, whether the proposal was arrived at through democratic dialogue and consultation with civil society, whether its outworking will be transparent and subject to democratic accountability and whether the proposal has the potential to promote Irish unity through all-Ireland harmonisation. Sinn Féin's decision to support, oppose or take a qualified approach will depends on the answer to these questions. To be valid, any EU harmonisation or co-operation measures in the area of justice and home affairs should require unanimity and have as their objective the increased protection of human rights. Sinn Féin supports measures that genuinely combat international crime or assist legitimate freedom of movement. However, its MEPs, Deputies, MLAs and Ministers will oppose any EU measures that are not fully human rights-compliant and consistent with international law. Sinn Féin rejects the federalist trend towards incremental integration and centralisation of policing and judicial powers ending in the eventual establishment of an EU border guard, EU police and an EU public prosecutor. Sinn Féin believes these are matters for sovereign states. Further to this Sinn Féin also rejects the accelerating impetus to harmonise criminal law between EU member states not only on the basis of safeguarding a cornerstone of nation-state sovereignty, but also because it is being done without first ensuring the harmonisation of rights protections, which currently vary widely from state to state. Sinn Féin cannot support criminal law harmonisation measures in the absence of equivalent protections. If one judges by the EU's track record in this area to date, Sinn Féin's concern is the emerging EU criminal justice system will not be a synthesis of the best practices and procedures that exist among the member states but instead will facilitate an unwise shift in rights away from individuals towards the police and prosecuting authorities. In addition, the current EU justice decision-making mechanisms lack adequate democratic accountability but it is to be hoped, given the intent of this Bill, that this position will improve. Unfortunately, this Bill will not address how Europol actually operates. The powers of the joint investigation teams introduced by domestic legislation in 2004 go beyond the existing Interpol and Europol mechanisms for police co-operation and information-sharing. This is considered to be an essential element of the so-called anti-terrorism roadmap. It allows for members of foreign, both EU and non-EU, police forces and possibly intelligence agencies to operate in the Irish jurisdiction, with potentially far-reaching consequences for the sovereignty and human rights of the Irish people. The implementing law does not foresee conditions under which bringing other police forces onto a joint investigation team is prohibited and does not elaborate conditions under which consent to enter a joint investigation team led by another state's police force should be withheld. It is based on a fundamentally flawed presumption that all EU police and intelligence forces are democratically sound, follow international best practice and can be trusted not to violate human rights. In fact, Amnesty International has condemned the vast majority of EU member states, including Britain and Ireland, for perpetrating abuses of human rights within their territories. Sinn Féin's concerns regarding the PSNI and the Garda are well known but one must also consider the track records of the police forces with which they will co-operate under the powers of joint investigation teams.Amnesty International has documented well-founded allegations of police ill-treatment and excessive use of force against detainees as well as impunity for these actions in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Some of these cases have resulted in wrongful deaths. Sinn Féin can support inter-jurisdictional police co-operation on investigation of serious crimes with a cross-border dimension where such co-operation is authorised on a case-by-case basis, limited to cases where it is necessary, and where there are appropriate safeguards and accountability mechanisms in place. However, Sinn Féin cannot support the operation of foreign police forces within the Irish jurisdiction, especially where such forces are not subject to domestic policing oversight and accountability mechanisms, and therefore does not support the use of joint investigation teams. In addition, foreign officers serving on joint investigation teams may come from a very different and in some cases much more aggressive or combative policing culture. At a minimum, therefore, foreign officers must be fully trained in human rights and must also be screened for misconduct before being permitted to serve in any capacity in the Irish jurisdiction. Human rights qualifications and misconduct screening must be essential prerequisites, therefore, for any joint investigation teams. Failure to meet these conditions must disqualify officers from serving on joint investigation teams in the Irish jurisdiction. The Schengen information system is Europe's largest security database. It started out principally as an electronic system for migration control and deportation. As such it is an essential part of the fortress Europe architecture we oppose. It allows EU member state police forces and consular officials to access and exchange data on specific individuals for the purpose of creating a secure common external frontier to the EU. However, such data can also include a list of ""persons to be submitted for discreet surveillance ... for the prevention of threats to public security"". It, therefore, has obvious implications for the right to data protection and privacy, and other civil liberties. The supplementary information request at the national entry, SIRENE, manual is a set of operating instructions and rules governing the exchange of electronic information under the Schengen information system. A human rights audit raised concerns about this system, highlighting significant flaws in the data protection regime and the need for greater accountability and increased safeguards. This first generation Schengen information system contained information on previous asylum applications, stolen cars and other stolen property, and persons registered for discreet surveillance. The second generation system, SIS-II, database has been extended to contain biometric data and information on extradition, EU arrest warrants and third country nationals refused entry to the EU. According to Statewatch, intelligence entries will also feature. Importantly, SIS-II is not just a database of information on migrants or on criminals. It is a mechanism that allows Europe-wide surveillance of the population in its entirety. The Government has introduced biometric passports and these biometrics will be stored on the SIS-II. In other words, soon enough we will all be on it. SIS-II is, therefore, a database of sensitive information to which a large number of authorities from all the member states and bodies such as Europol that are completely unaccountable to the Irish people -it is to be hoped that might change somewhat with the provisions of this Bill - will have access as of right. That is, if the information is on the joint system, they can have it. There is no need to request it from the national authority, from which the information originates, and no need to explain to the national authority why it is being requested. This is in marked contrast to the requirement of judicial authorisation before law enforcement agencies can access sensitive data, which Sinn Féin supports. Under the principle of availability, access to SIS-II data will be automatic regardless of the nationality of the data subject or the rules that apply in his or her country of residence. Moreover, Europol will be able to share this sensitive information with third countries. This is a dangerous prospect, given that the CIA kidnapped individuals from EU member states during its programme of extraordinary renditions under the Administration of President George W. Bush."	spk_206
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-10-04	dail	31	Europol Bill 2012: Second Stage	dbsect_7	"For all of these reasons, at a minimum, we seek the following: a guarantee that there will be no latent development of additional SIS-II functions to allow even more agencies access to extend the purposes for which data obtained from SIS-II may be used and the types of information that will be uploaded; sufficient safeguards against function creep towards ""fishing expeditions"" as opposed to the current ""hit or no hit"" and towards biometric searches without judicial authorisation instead of simple verification functions; and full respect for and enforcement of data protection rights. Current EU justice policy is fixated on security to the detriment of freedom, justice and rights. This fixation is embodied by the set of draconian measures that make up the so-called EU anti-terrorism roadmap, including the common definition of terrorist offences and terrorist blacklists, the Schengen security database, the EU arrest warrant, and the establishment of joint investigation teams. Sinn Féin opposes ongoing attempts to create an EU security and surveillance super-state in the name of the so-called war on terrorism, because we do not believe that any approach which involves draconian measures will make people or communities in Ireland or the EU any safer. We believe that security and human rights are indivisible and we will challenge the EU securocrat agenda. We will continue to oppose actively the evolving EU surveillance state, including such measures as universal mandatory data retention and the introduction of biometric identifiers on passports, visas and residency permits. The so-called EU anti-terrorism roadmap and related measures should be scrapped and replaced with a human rights-compliant strategy based on a human security approach, that is, one that seeks to prevent and resolve conflict by recognising and resolving the root causes of conflict. There are additional concerns over data protection. We know that Europol can enter into agreements with third countries. There are two classes of agreement: organisational agreements and strategic agreements. Organisational agreements exist where the European Council has given approval for transfer of classified information and personal data because it is satisfied the country has adequate arrangements for handling and protecting such data. Organisational agreements exist with Australia, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and the United States. While quite stringent data protection guidelines are being developed within the EU - although in Ireland the data protection infrastructure is under some pressure to meet its responsibilities - we need clarity as to the framework and criteria we would seek from those countries regarding data protection. Deputy Niall Collins mentioned the RAND report, which gave an analysis of the changes that would result from the Council directive and the Bill before us. It would introduce a data protection officer, who is a member of Europol staff but acts independently. While on the face of it that is very welcome, we could do with clarification on the level of the independence, which would be important regarding the issue I just mentioned of third country access to data. How would this data protection officer oversee that? I ask the Minister to give clarification on that. Section 13 provides that anyone with concerns about possible information held can apply to the Data Protection Commissioner, as with other data protection requests, although the release of information can be refused on the grounds that it would: prejudice national security or be contrary to public policy, prejudice criminal proceedings in the State, or jeopardise the safety of a person. I seek reassurance that it would not be applied arbitrarily but as presented. The Bill would mean that changing Europol in the future should be easier, as changes will no longer require ratification. What would be the level of accountability to the Irish people with any proposed changes to or increases in the powers of Europol in the future? I understand the board will have qualified majority voting. If the Bill is passed, what assurances can the Minister give us that the Irish people will have the ability to oversee the changes to ensure we do not cede more of our sovereignty in this area? I look forward to discussing the issue of Europol further on Committee Stage."	spk_208

It is astonishing that it has taken so long to reach this point. I echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, who stated in his opening remarks that although Sinn Féin will support the proposal, it does not nearly go far enough in terms of incorporating children's rights into the Constitution. The amendment seeks to resolve child protection issues and the ongoing issues around adoption which have prevented marital children in very long-term care from being adopted, even where there is no chance that their parents will ever be able to provide the requisite care. However, the provision may be open to legal challenge, given that Article 41, which provides for the elevated position of the constitutional family based on marriage, will remain unchanged. The amendment will allow children to have their say in guardianship matters and will ensure their best interests are the paramount consideration in guardianship and adoption proceedings brought by the State. In terms of what the amendment seeks to achieve, that much is clear. What is also clear, however, is that it goes no further. The proposal is, by design, very limited. It was specifically framed as such by a Government which knew it was obliged to address child protection and adoption issues and that there was massive public support for enshrining the rights of children in the Constitution. There was simply no way it could further delay taking some action. The proposal was designed in such a way that the Government could be seen to act by providing the window dressing of a new constitutional article enshrining unspecified ""natural and imprescriptible"" rights for children, but without making actual provision for any such rights. Let us be under no illusion about the impact of what is proposed here. The amendment will make life better for a very small number of children who are at risk, in respect of whom the State will now have a legal power to intervene. It will also make life better for those children who would otherwise languish in long-term foster care for years on end. It will, however, make no difference to children with disabilities who do not have access to the services they need. It will make no difference to children who live in poverty and go to school hungry on a daily basis. It will make no difference to the lives of children with mental health difficulties who are regularly packed off to adult wards because the State will not invest in the necessary services. The proposal establishes no right to health care, no right to make a child's best interests the paramount concern in all matters concerning them, no right to special needs assistants, and no right to be schooled in adequate accommodation instead of prefabricated buildings. There will still be homeless children sleeping on Dawson Street and Grafton Street after the amendment is passed because they will still have no right to shelter. The State will continue to fail all of these children. To the vast majority of children in this country, the amendment will be meaningless and devoid of any tangible benefit. The crux of the matter, of course, is that rights cost money, and Fine Gael and the Labour Party do not believe in investing in children's rights. If they had any interest in doing so, the annual Estimates for each Department would look very different. If they had a real commitment to children's rights, the formula of words for the constitutional amendment would incorporate the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into domestic law. Enshrining rights and implementing them costs money, however, and would require a wholesale overhaul of how we tax and spend at Government level. In other words, it would require a radical shift in thinking, which, as we know, will not happen. Instead, the Government will keep cutting expenditure until people are forced to give up everything. Sinn Féin has questioned the Government before on the number of children who have been voluntarily placed in the care of the State because their parents can no longer financially cope with raising them. We are told repeatedly that no child is ever taken into care because of poverty, but that simply is not true. Notwithstanding these deficiencies and the narrowness of its remit, the constitutional amendment deserves support because it will make some children's lives better, and that is worth it. It represents a beginning on the long road to incorporating the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into Irish law and ensuring children have rights to health, housing and education and to have their best interests the paramount concern in all decisions that involve them. While it is not sufficient in itself to address the issue of children's rights, it does acknowledge the potential for children to have rights. After the referendum, when the Labour Party and Fine Gael have washed their hands of these issues, we will continue to call for a guarantee of children's rights to shelter, an adequate living standard and health care. We will work to ensure children are given rights to education, play, leisure and access to information. We will maintain our commitment to ensure, above all, that children are protected from all forms of abuse, neglect and exploitation, including special care for refugee children, safeguards for children in the criminal justice system, protection for children in employment, and protection and rehabilitation for children who have suffered exploitation or abuse of any kind. Those are the genuine safeguards towards which we will continue to strive."	spk_358
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-09-26	dail	31	Magdalen Laundries: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_27	"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. It is a matter of urgency that the matter before us is addressed. We are simply seeking to have an acknowledgement from all Members of the House that supports must be put in place urgently for the ageing survivors of the Magdalen laundries. Thereafter, we must have an open and meaningful debate on the issues of an apology, redress and restorative justice. We will never know the full story of the injustices, suffering and sheer torment experienced by the women and girls incarcerated in the Magdalen laundries. This injustice was exacerbated and compounded by their exclusion from the residential institutions redress scheme. The Magdalen laundries and Bethany homes are another dark chapter in the litany of abuses perpetuated on the women of Ireland by the churches with State complicity, yet no apology has been forthcoming from the State for the terror inflicted on the women in question. It is astonishing that not one representative of the Government Departments and statutory bodies which had a hand in ensuring the involuntary servitude of women has ever felt the need to apologise. The State was complicit in the Magdalen laundries and questions remain about the role of the Garda Síochána, which returned Magdalen runaways to the laundries by the hair on their heads. Notwithstanding this, the Government sees fit to inform the House that an interdepartmental committee is examining the issue. I am not a spokesperson for the Magdalen women but someone who believes in justice. I am also an elected representative who has a role in holding the Government to account. The Government's approach is not good enough. Having spent years and in some cases decades in incarceration, slaving, cleaning and toiling to keep religious orders as profitable industries, the Magdalen survivors are spending the rest of their lives shamed and stigmatised by a State that did not care. Many of them are elderly and suffering ill health as a result of the treatment they experienced. There are at least 30,000 Magdalen survivors. It is a tragedy of epic proportions that no member of the religious orders and no representative of the State has been held to account for the torture inflicted on what were described as ""fallen women"". Even today, questions need to be asked about the religious orders and their motivations. Two of the religious congregations which ran the Magdalen laundries, the Good Shepherd Sisters and Sisters of Our Lady of Charity, receive funding from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health to work with women involved in prostitution, while other organisations which promote women's rights have had their funding slashed. One could be forgiven for asking if it is still the official view of the State that there are fallen women out there. Both of the religious congregations to which I referred have refused to meet the Justice for Magdalenes group, yet we are expected to believe it is appropriate that they are entrusted with caring for and advocating on behalf of vulnerable women. It is interesting that the State was run for decades on the basis of a Constitution framed around God and Christian values. The way in which the Magdalen institutions were run, ignored by the apparatus of the State, could not be further from the teachings of Christ. The Magdalen laundries were evil. What we had in this State were anti-Christian institutions posturing as Christians. Not only did they turn a blind eye to the disgusting enslavement of women and children, they also preached moral values to others, upheld conservative, right-wing establishment politics, and told people to keep their heads down and not question educated professionals.The answer they have for our people is so profound but they could not have been further away from the teachings of Christ. Each and every one of them should be ashamed of themselves. The institutions which covered this up and utilised religion and Christ's teachings to enslave and hold our people down should be ashamed of themselves too. I have had the honour of knowing genuine Christians who served overseas on the missions and defended oppressed people. They too were let down and failed by their hierarchy. This is the great shame of an institution which used the teachings of Christ to oppress their people and support institutions of government to do likewise. Shame on anyone who was involved in that and calls themselves a Christian. Those of us who actually have a faith in Christ need to have these conversations. We are ashamed of those institutions which used Christ's name to uphold disgusting acts, to defend right-wing, conservative politics and to oppress our people for decades. It is high time this issue was resolved with the obfuscation and stalling ended. We know what happened in the Magdalen laundries was slavery and is a black stain on our people's conscience. The Government must do the right thing and put in place the procedures for justice. We can then wait for the report of Senator McAleese, in whom we all have great faith."	spk_382

In 2011 a report by the special rapporteur on child protection, Geoffrey Shannon, exposed the alarming inadequacy of laws, procedures and resources to protect children from abuse. The lack of regulated access to soft information on potential abusers of children was one of the main issues that needed to be addressed so it is heartening to see the Minister has brought this forward as one of the first pieces of legislation to be dealt with during this Dáil term. The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, of which my colleague Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin was a member in the previous Dáil, recommended in September 2008 that legislation to regulate soft information be introduced. It is long overdue. The right to one’s good name is covered by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and as such it should be a cornerstone of any truly human rights-based justice policy. This right contains within it the benefits of the presumption of innocence and protection of good name and livelihood. However, we recognise that the children of Ireland have a right to - and are entitled to - the highest standards of protection. For too long, the history of the State has been blighted by a litany of horror stories in which this protection was denied to them. It is frightening to think there is a very real possibility that we have only scratched the surface of these stories. As legislators working to develop a justice system that maintains the accused’s right to a good name while simultaneously protecting children, there is an onus on us to ensure any legislative amendment regarding the exchange of soft information has a sound constitutional footing and is insulated from challenge. There are parts of the Bill about which I have concerns in this regard and I am hopeful they will be dealt with appropriately and adequately on Committee Stage. Further to this, the rights of a person being vetted to a good name and to a livelihood must be balanced with the rights of children to the highest standards of child protection. As Garda and police vetting deals only with hard information such as on convictions relating to prospective employees, problems arise regarding individuals who may have been reported for an offence but never charged due to insufficient evidence, or prosecuted for an offence but never convicted as a consequence of a flawed investigation or other technicality, but who nevertheless may continue to pose a risk to children. There is a clear argument in favour of sharing information where needed when an allegation did not result in conviction but a real concern still exists. As an exceptional case, and we must emphasise this is an exception, in the interests of the protection of children as a paramount public policy consideration, Sinn Féin is in favour of the dissemination of soft information. However, we believe it must be very carefully managed, with independent oversight, and subject to robust safeguards. We are carefully examining the provisions of the Bill to ensure this is managed correctly, as well as ensuring full human rights and data protection compliance. It is our view that those provisions concerning soft information should only deal with information that has been brought to the attention of the Garda or the HSE. We welcome the fact that individuals should be informed if they are placed on a soft information list and be given appropriate opportunity to appeal the limits set upon them by being placed on such a list, prior to any request for vetting being placed upon them by a third party. We are examining the legislation to ensure it requires that one central vetting unit stores all information in compliance with data protection legislation. There must be no confusion as to the types of information applicable to this legislation. We will submit amendments to require that a person being entered on any soft information list be informed of the action and be given adequate notice to appeal. I am not convinced that 14 days will be enough in all cases. Notice must be given of the types of employment likely to be affected by this, and furthermore, notice must be given of the length of time a person's name will remain on any list. Only after a person is informed of his or her name being placed on a list, and given adequate time to appeal, should any third party request for information be processed. The legislation must be reviewed periodically and those eligible for removal from the list on the basis of inaccurate information being held must be removed promptly. Appeal processes must be adequate and not subject to undue delay, which brings me to my next point. The new national vetting bureau must be resourced accordingly. We are all aware that the cutbacks to Garda budgets are having a major impact on the ability of gardaí to do their work. We are dealing with a society where mandatory reporting will be the norm. The Children First guidelines will soon be placed on a statutory footing and an increase in awareness of child abuse and its effects, coupled with the introduction of a legal facility for the sharing of soft information, will mean an added strain on the newly established vetting bureau. We will propose further amendments to ensure robust safeguards for soft information including clear safeguards, limits and controls monitored by an independent body on how the vetting bureau gains, stores, reproduces and accesses soft information. While we cannot underestimate the importance in using this legislation to firm up child protection measures, we also cannot underestimate the need to keep such information confidential and made available on a strict need to know basis. There must be a statutory obligation on a receiving agency or employer not to store or disseminate vetting results disclosed to them by the vetting bureau beyond the strictly necessary, and severe penalties for a breach. In the interest of fairness, we must also ensure limited restrictions to contesting discrimination where a person feels an employer acted above and beyond that which was required by the vetting soft information list and we strongly urge the Government to examine the option of introducing an independent body to investigate the appeals. Furthermore, the legislation should clearly outline how international vetting is to be conducted and the standards in other jurisdictions we deem necessary for us to facilitate the exchange of information requests. The Government must acknowledge that measures such as sex offender registers and vetting in isolation will not stop abhorrent crimes of sexual abuse from occurring. Vetting of people who work with children is still problematic and slow despite improvements made in recent years. The partition of the island also poses a considerable challenge for the Garda and the PSNI in the management of those who pose a risk to children and young people or who are sex offenders. In the past, the NSPCC has highlighted various arrangements throughout the EU for holding and disclosing criminal record information, managing and tracking sex offenders, and vetting and barring arrangements. It highlighted one case where a French national convicted of murder and sexual assaults was able to gain employment in a Belgian school where he continued to offend. It has called for common EU standards in regard to the sharing of information and vetting and it is something worth examining but in saying that, it is important not to forget that there is no minimum standard of human rights adherence across the EU. Both Ireland and Britain have enacted legislation to ensure convicted sex offenders notify authorities of their whereabouts and progress has been made on information sharing in regard to sex offenders. However, while agencies in the North risk manage all sex offenders in a structured way, risk management approaches are only now being advanced in the Twenty-six Counties. Common legislation and policy development on a North-South basis is essential to prevent certain individuals from exploiting the Border. The 2006 report from the joint Oireachtas committee on child protection and the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children in its first interim report of September 2008 recommended that the vetting system be put on a statutory footing and that organisations be legally required to vet all staff, both paid workers and volunteers, working with children. The committees also recommended the introduction of legislation to regulate the collection and exchange of records of criminal convictions and information, including soft information, which would bring the State closer in line with the situation in the Six Counties following the Ian Huntley inquiry. It is a shame that it has taken so long to look at this area but I commend the Minister for bringing forward this Bill now. The need for a comprehensive vetting system and good protocols in information exchange cannot be underestimated. Barnardos has systematically campaigned for a comprehensive vetting system to be put in place in Ireland for all those who have access to children and young people, whether in a professional or voluntary capacity, which should include all those who are at a policy, managerial and face to face level. It is well known that sex offenders are using open borders as a means of evading detection and prosecution.  There are broader questions to be asked about how we address this. Information exchange protocols and corresponding structures in other countries are theoretically a wonderful idea but they need to be resourced with proper levels of financial, technological and staff capacity in Ireland to ensure that information is used in a meaningful way and not abused and that children are protected. Given the cutbacks in resourcing to gardaí that hamper them in doing even the most basic of policing tasks, such as responding to burglaries in rural areas, we have genuine concerns as to how this would operate.	spk_570

As the Minister of State may know, a very serious campaign was run a number of years ago when there was a threat to the stations at Malin Head and Valentia.  The community across the north west including the fishing community and all of the public representatives in the region on a cross-Border basis argued the case for Malin Head and its 100 year history of service to be sustained.Yet another report has been published, this one from Fisher Associates, recommending the closure of Malin Head.  The public representatives in Donegal and the north west will ask for this recommendation to be rejected immediately.  There is no logic to it in terms of savings.  At present a major investment is under way at Malin Head which will be completed and open soon.  Malin Head, Valentia and Dublin have the capacity to deliver all that is required.  In real terms, the recommendations of the report would probably mean saving one job or two at most.  A statement needs to be made urgently reassuring people in the north west our long campaign to save Malin Head does not need to be reopened.  The Minister of State should be very clear that the people of the north west will fight like tigers to defend Malin Head.  The fishing community and all of the representatives in the region will not accept any suggestion that the centre be closed.  We have been neglected enough and there is no way we will accept any such suggestion without one hell of a fight.	spk_438
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-07-10	dail	31	Coast Guard Stations	dbsect_29	I thank the Minister of State for his response.  In 2003 another serious consultancy, Deloitte & Touche, published a report which recommended that Malin Head and Valentia remain open and Dublin be closed.  However, what has happened is that the Dublin centre has been sustained and upgraded, while we had to fight like tigers for Malin Head and Valentia.  We will do the same again.I welcome the recent substantial investment in Malin Head and welcome the fact the centre will reopen soon.  However, I want an assurance from the Government today, or as soon as possible, that Malin Head will not be closed, as recommended here.  That recommendation is causing great alarm across the north west.  It is not just about having the telecommunications infrastructure, but about having local knowledge and an understanding of the culture, geography, locations and names that occur.  Operators in Malin Head would understand these.  The station in Malin Head is of huge importance for our region.  We fought for it before and thought the issue had been put to bed forever.We thought the investment in Malin Head was a clear signal that everything there would remain, but now we have this report.  We need an assurance, as soon as possible, that the Government will not accept the recommendation to close Malin Head and will not deal another blow to the north west.  We have never needed this station more and need a vote of confidence from the Government.  We have had setbacks in the north west.  For example, the Derry to Dublin air link was not supported by the Government and it has pulled back from the A5 project.  Thankfully, however, the Northern Executive has honoured the A5 project and it will go ahead.  We need no further setbacks from the Government.  It has the opportunity now to do the right thing and to make it clear that Malin Head coast guard station will remain.	spk_441

Members of rural communities have protested outside the Dáil and the Garda Representative Association has spoken out about these cuts and expressed concerns in recent times.  I bring to the Taoiseach's attention an incident which occurred in my constituency in recent days as I am sure it will cause him concern.  A few weeks ago, gardaí were taking more than 24 hours to take statements in response to reports of thefts and crimes.  It became more serious in recent days when a woman returned to her home to find it had been burgled and was informed by the garda on duty, when she telephoned her local Garda station in some distress, that he did not have a vehicle available to him.  When she offered to collect him to bring him to her home the garda - fair play to him - showed flexibility and took up her offer and visited her home to investigate the crime.  Warnings issued by the Garda Representative Association are now being realised on the ground.  There are insufficient personnel and vehicles to provide backup to communities.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to urgently review the impact of cuts on the Garda Síochána, to meet the Garda Commissioner as soon as possible to consider cases such as this, and to put in place a plan that will reassure communities in rural areas and along the Border that they are safe and have the Garda cover they need?	spk_30

I will send him the relevant details.Referring to the closure of Garda stations, the outgoing president of the Garda Representative Association, Damien McCarthy, made the following prophetic statement at the GRA conference in April:It's going to become perhaps a safe breeding ground for criminal activity.  It's going to contribute significantly to the fear of crime particularly amongst our senior citizens around the country.The incident I highlighted is highly embarrassing for the local garda in question, of whom I am not in any way critical.  In all the complaints that I and other Deputies are receiving on this issue no one blames rank and file gardaí.  The current president of the GRA, Mr. John Parker, has noted the following:Nearly one in every five garda vehicles has been withdrawn and not replaced due to budget cuts for the garda fleet over the past two years.  It is set to get worse as more and more vehicles reach the end of their life and can no longer be maintained safely.There is a problem and there is no point glossing over it.  I ask the Taoiseach to speak to the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is in denial and passes the buck to the Commissioner and superintendents.  Let us have a conversation about the reality emerging in rural communities in respect of Garda response times.  Gardaí on the ground deserve better and should be provided with the resources they require to do their job to the ability they clearly possess.	spk_34

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-07-04	dail	31	European Council: Statements	dbsect_5	"The headline coming out of last week's summit was that the link between banking and sovereign debt has been broken, but the problem with headlines is that they are short on detail, they can miss the bigger picture and they can distract from more substantive issues.  I am afraid last week's headlines did all three.We cannot even talk about the detail of what was achieved because we have no idea.  We know there is some sort of commitment to look at splitting banking and sovereign debt by allowing banks to be recapitalised by the ESM.  That, if it comes to pass, will be a good thing, would represent an achievement for the Spanish and Italian Governments and should act as an example to this Government of what is possible when we argue for it.  This could most definitely bring big benefits to Ireland, and Sinn Féin warmly welcomes that.It is also what should have happened in the first place but we were told it was not possible and to stop asking for it.  However, the devil will be in the detail and, as ever, we are promised conditionality will be the deciding factor.  Conditionality, as we have learned, means doing as we are told.  We will learn over time what the President of the Council means when he says ""under certain circumstances and under certain conditions, the ESM could recapitalise banks directly"".  We know that it will come with a memorandum of understanding and the conditions will be, to quote the euro area statement, ""institution-specific, sector-specific or economy-wide"".  That clears that up.  There will be no charity and no solidarity flowing from this decision.  Of that we can be sure.If it helps to ease the proportion of debt directly lumped onto our people, then it is welcome.  The use of the ESM to which we could have a total liability of €11 billion represents, once again, a huge amount of money being pumped into failed banks instead of the real economy.  Sinn Féin has always argued that depositors must be protected but private banks must be allowed to wind up and bondholders must feel losses.  Banks should only be recapitalised when toxic losses are removed from their balance sheets and when it is of benefit to the State.  We argue the ECB, not taxpayers, should be directly involved in the recapitalisation.  That is the bigger picture the headline misses and one that is linked to much more substantive issues that the summit skirted around or simply ignored.The substantive issue of this summit should have been getting energy back into Europe's economy through stimulating growth and making the investment and the policies necessary to achieve that.  The real headline should be the latest failure in a summit, after countless other times, of the EU to change tack and move towards a policy that would create jobs and wealth throughout the EU.  I am sure the apologists for the austerity hawks will point to what was agreed in the so-called compact for growth and jobs and Council conclusions as proof a pro-growth agenda.  That argument is very quickly dispelled by even a cursory glance at the content of what was agreed.First, a stimulus package must be about putting money into the real economy.  Here, the deal falls at the first hurdle. The amount of extra moneys is pitifully small.  Only one point of the compact deals with figures, and they are noticeable only for their tininess.  We are told the ElB's paid-in capital will be increased by €10 billion and that, magically, this will unlock €180 billion of additional investment.  How €10 billion becomes €180 billion is not explained.  There is mention of project bonds of €4.5 billion for pilot projects, none of which include Ireland.  There is the often repeated story of reallocating Structural Funds.  We know by now that this has almost zero impact in Ireland.  We have spent or committed all our Structural Funds for this period.The Commission, and now the Council, has clearly stated that member states ""also have the possibility to consider reallocations within their national envelopes, under existing rules and in cooperation with the Commission"".  There will be no impact in Ireland due to any tinkering with Structural Funds and little anywhere else.To put this in context, SIPTU and others have argued for a €10 billion stimulus package for this part of Ireland with a population of 5 million.  What the EU effectively is putting on the table is €10 billion for 500 million people.  It is pathetically small and is not a serious stimulus package or even close to one.  Everyone knows it.  There is, thankfully, more to the compact than figures; there are some worthwhile ideas, it must be admitted.  Adapting the ESF to provide a youth guarantee is worth examining, as is the need to focus on the EU's research and development capabilities and strengthening our SMEs.Unfortunately, however, in total the compact and the ideas in it make for depressing reading for anybody looking for a change in direction or genuinely new socially and economically responsible thinking.  We are told the austerity-driven two-pack should be applied fully and effectively and recourse to peer pressure should be enhanced.  The language is telling and it is depressing.  ""Fiscal consolidation"" that is ""growth-friendly"" yet ""differentiated"" yet ""respecting the Stability and Growth Pact"" yet ""taking into account country-specific circumstances"" is to be used to get us of this mess.  This language, like austerity, makes no sense.We have an ideological return to what has failed and what is failing.  Great emphasis will be put on the implementation of the services directive, one of the most neoliberal, anti-worker directives ever to come from Brussels - from the leadership of Charlie McCreevy, to be precise.  The compact for growth and jobs is not a stimulus.  There is barely any money and it is not a new push for jobs and growth.  It contains old failed policies given a new lease of life and a new name.  It will not work and it is not designed to work; it is designed to give political cover as austerity grinds on.The growth sideshow is of course also cover for the other real purpose of this summit: to centralise, centralise and centralise at all costs.  President Van Rompuy was quite explicit in his post-Council statement: ""This summit was about combining short-term action to stimulate growth and to stabilise the markets, together with a longer-term vision on the way forward to strengthen our economic and monetary union.""  The first part of that statement is the cover, while the second part is the truth of what this summit was really about: the deepening of fiscal ties to the point of fiscal union.Who is to be charged with carrying out this task that our Government will not talk about?  The President of the European Council, in close co-operation with the Presidents of the Commission, the euro group and the European Central Bank - four presidents without a single citizen's vote behind them as a mandate.  President Van Rompuy stated that ""Member states will be closely involved"" and ""There will also be consultations with the European Parliament"", but the power is with the cabal.  Our Government and our MEPs are reduced to waiting with bated breath for the wise words of bureaucrats with a simple and explicit agenda - fiscal and political union above all else.  These four unelected middle-aged men are to go off and come back with a plan to realise full economic and monetary union in the interests of the citizens of Ireland and other nations.  What has our Government got to say?  As usual, absolutely nothing.  That is what we are used to - going along with the flow, never raising objections or standing up for Irish sovereignty.  It has got us nowhere and it will never work as a strategy, although to call it a strategy might be giving the Government too much credit.  It was another summit demonstrating another failure of the EU and particularly of this Government to deliver an agenda of growth and to stand up against the forces of centralisation and permanent austerity.A number of Syrian citizens appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade recently.

Ireland has been at the heart of this issue in the past and can be again if we choose to do so.  Ireland has a long and proud record on seeking to prevent nuclear proliferation.  In 1958, when Mr. Frank Aiken was Minister for External Affairs, Ireland proposed the first UN resolution which sought to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.  In 1961 the UN General Assembly unanimously approved an Irish resolution calling on all states, particularly the nuclear powers, to conclude an international agreement to refrain from transfer or acquisition of nuclear weapons.  In 1968, when the non-proliferation treaty, NPT, was open for signature, Ireland was invited to be the first to sign in recognition of the part that Ireland had played in the international efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation.The NPT has been a success and few people would deny that it has been an effective brake on nuclear proliferation.  Today, the NPT has 189 signatories with five of them - China, France, Russia, the UK and the US - as ""nuclear weapon"" states and the other 184 as ""non-nuclear weapon"" states.  Under Article IX(3) of the treaty, states that exploded a nuclear weapon before 1967 qualify as ""nuclear-weapon"" states and are allowed to keep their nuclear weapons for now but must disarm eventually.  Three states - India, Israel and Pakistan - refused to sign the NPT and secretly developed nuclear weapons.  As these states chose to remain outside the NPT, they did not breach any treaty obligations by doing so.  In addition, North Korea developed nuclear weapons while a party to the NPT but later withdrew from it.Today, more than two decades after the end of the Cold War, there are upwards of 20,000 nuclear warheads in the world, according to the Federation of American Scientists.  The vast bulk of these warheads are in the possession of the US and Russia, with approximately 5,000 warheads operational.  There is a long way to go to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons, which President Obama talked about in his speech in Prague in April 2009.Since the end of the Cold War, the US and Russia have significantly reduced their nuclear stockpiles, and so has the UK.  However, it cannot be said that these or the other ""nuclear-weapon"" states have fulfilled their disarmament obligations under Article VI of the treaty.  This states, ""Each of the parties to the treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament.""  None of the five states that possessed nuclear weapons before 1967 and were therefore allowed to join the NPT as ""nuclear-weapon"" states has disarmed.  All of them have still got nuclear weapons and have continuously modernised their systems.  There is no sign whatsoever of any of them giving up their nuclear weapons.Is this fair to all those states that have signed up to the NPT as ""non-nuclear weapon"" states and undertaken not to acquire nuclear weapons?  The five NPT members that possessed nuclear weapons in 1967 retain them despite their undertaking to engage in ""nuclear disarmament"".  In addition, the NPT is not universal.  The three states of India, Israel and Pakistan have engaged in nuclear proliferation on a grand scale outside the NPT but they have not been subject to the kind of sanctions now being applied to Iran, which has no nuclear weapons.  It is true that all three states used to be in the international nuclear dog house in the sense that they were unable to purchase nuclear material and equipment from the rest of the world, which made it difficult for them to expand their civil nuclear programmes.  In July 2005, the Bush Administration signed the US-India nuclear agreement, an initiative which has lead to India being taken out of the dog house; it is now free to engage in international nuclear commerce while retaining and developing its nuclear weapons.  India has, in effect, become the world's sixth officially recognised nuclear power.As a member of the nuclear suppliers group, NSG, of states, Ireland played a small part in India's elevation.  On 6 September 2008, it consented to the amendment of the NSG guidelines to make an exception for India and allow that country alone to import nuclear material and equipment without all its nuclear facilities being subject to International Atomic Energy Agency inspection.  The NSG operates by consensus and theoretically Ireland could have prevented such an extraordinary anomaly being introduced into its guidelines but it did not.  Ironically, the NSG came into being in 1974 as a result of India developing and testing a nuclear device using plutonium from a reactor imported from Canada for civil purposes.The UK is currently upgrading its nuclear weapons and the Trident submarines to deliver them.  The new system is planned to provide the UK with an operational nuclear weapons capability until 2050 and beyond.  It is instructive to consider the arguments that have been made to justify the vast expenditure involved.  A White Paper published by the Labour Government in December 2006 asserted that the UK must have nuclear weapons ""to deter and prevent nuclear blackmail and acts of aggression against our vital interests that cannot be countered by other means"".  Last Monday, the UK Minister responsible for defence, Conservative MP Philip Hammond, told the House of Commons that ""The possession of a strategic nuclear deterrent has ensured this country's safety.  It ensured that we saw off the threat in the Cold War and it will ensure our security in the future.""  On the same occasion, Labour MP Ms Alison Seabeck echoed Hammond, stating ""In a security landscape of few guarantees, our independent nuclear deterrent provides us with the ultimate insurance policy, strengthens our national security and increases our ability to achieve long-term global security aims.""I quote these arguments to show that it is very unlikely that Britain will ever give up its nuclear weapons, as it is supposed to do according to Article VI of the NPT.  The arguments used are relevant not just for today but arguably for all time.  British politicians will always be able to justify the continued possession of nuclear weapons ""to deter and prevent nuclear blackmail and acts of aggression against vital interests that cannot be countered by other means"", and the same applies to every other nuclear weapons state.In one sense, nuclear weapons are ""the ultimate insurance policy""; states that possess these are less likely to get attacked, at least by other states.  We can consider what has happened to the three states that President Bush declared to ""constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world"" in his 2002 state of the union address.  Iraq, which did not possess nuclear weapons, was invaded by the US and the UK in March 2003 and its regime was overthrown.  Iran, which does not possess nuclear weapons, is continuously threatened with military action by the US and Israel and may yet be attacked.  However, the US has not threatened to use force against North Korea because it has at least a rudimentary nuclear weapons system.When North Korea exploded a nuclear device in May 2009, after initial condemnation the country was invited to take part in further negotiations.  There is an important lesson there for states that do not possess nuclear weapons; if they want to be free from ""the threat or use of force"", which is supposed to be prohibited by Article 2.4 of the UN Charter, if at all possible, they should get at least a rudimentary nuclear weapons system.I recommend to the Tánaiste that he read the pamphlet issued by the Peace and Neutrality Alliance, led by Mr. Roger Cole, a member of the Labour Party.  It was drawn up by Dr. David Morrison, a respected and eminent expert in the field, and offers some balanced comments on the situation in Iran and the Middle East.  It points out that the United States and its allies which claim they want to see the Middle East free from nuclear weapons are applying ferocious economic sanctions and threatening military action against Iran which has not got a single nuclear weapon and its nuclear facilities are open to IAEA inspections.  However, they are utterly opposed to applying sanctions to Israel, despite its possession of perhaps as many as 400 nuclear warheads and its the ability to deliver them by aircraft, ballistic missile and submarine-launched cruise missiles and wipe off the map any capital in the Middle East and probably much further afield and its nuclear facilities are almost entirely closed to the IAEA.  Far from sanctioning Israel, the United States gives it over $3 billion a year in military aid and, despite an enormous budget deficit, the amount has increased every year under the Obama Administration, as the President was at pains to emphasise in his speech to AIPAC on 4 March.  More US tax dollars go to Israel than to any other state.A double standard is being applied to Iran and Israel in this regard.  The United States and its allies frequently state that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, this will inevitably lead to the widespread proliferation of nuclear weapons the Middle East.  That, they state, is one of the reasons Iran must not be allowed to acquire them.  It is rarely mentioned that, because of Israel's acquisition of nuclear weapons, Iran and other states in the region would be within their rights to withdraw from the NPT and develop nuclear weapons as Israel which never signed the NPT has done without breaching international obligations.The Irish branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has pointed out that while Irish foreign policy has always strongly endorsed nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, this is not matched by Irish financial policies.  The National Pension Reserve Fund, according to its 2011 report, has investments of at least €23 million in international arms companies which produce single use components for the nuclear weapons industry.  AIB which is in majority state ownership lent $28 million to an American company involved in the nuclear weapons industry in 2010.  Other countries which play a leading role in support of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament such as Norway and New Zealand prohibit the investment of state funds in companies involved in the nuclear weapons industry.  There is a similar ban in Ireland on investments in companies engaged in the landmine and cluster munitions industries but not in the nuclear weapons industry.Irish CND made six recommendations, which I endorse.  Ireland, despite the current economic difficulties, should continue to play a leading role in support of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.  It should take a lead in working for a nuclear weapons convention, together with other like-minded states.  It should continue to support the processes and frameworks of the non-proliferation treaty but must be prepared to go beyond the NPT to address its weaknesses.  It should engage with NGOs such as the International Red Cross-Red Crescent and like-minded states to apply international humanitarian law to achieve a ban on nuclear weapons.  It should support a multilateral approach to easing the nuclear tensions in the Middle East.  It should ban investments in companies involved in the nuclear arms industry by State funds and financial institutions based in the State.The difficulty with the NPT is that while it has had a considerable impact in preventing the further proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction that pose an existential threat to the world, unbelievable double standards are at play.  The five NPT states that have nuclear weapons and are permitted to keep them - the permanent members of the UN Security Council - can prevent a real removal of these weapons.  As they hold a veto on the UN Security Council, there cannot be a UN Security Council resolution.  While these double standards are in place, it undermines our moral credibility when trying to engage with states we are trying to persuade not to develop nuclear weapons.We were leaders in this process when it started and have a great deal of credibility in the field.  We still have neutral status, even though the use of Shannon Airport has undermined this.  We are respected by the various players, particularly now, and could make an intervention to assist the process with Iran.  We are respected by the United States and in Europe as honest brokers.  I would volunteer that we are also respected by Iran as honest brokers.  Could we not assist the process to reach its conclusion?  These are the opportunities and the Government has stated it would like to reinstate Ireland's global reputation.  We have a great reputation in the defence of human rights, in this field and overseas development.  We must reassert ourselves in these spaces and use the credibility and legacy we enjoy to address these issues."	spk_118
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-06-19	dail	31	Local Government (Household Charge) (Repeal) Bill 2012: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_32	The Government must be honest and accept that the household charge is a mess and it will not be possible to pursue through the courts hundreds of thousands of citizens it knows to be honest people who have worked hard throughout their lives.  I can only speak with authority about my home county of Donegal.  There was a grassroots campaign of ordinary people across the county who decided to stand up against the charge.  They organised meetings in packed rooms across the county.  I looked at the profiles, read the local newspaper columns and followed it very closely.  These were not radical far left people or something like that.  These were ordinary people who voted Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Sinn Féin and independents.  They voted across the spectrum but they just cannot accept this charge as being fair.  They know where the money is going.  They know this is not some scheme to fund local council services.  Such services have been run down incrementally over recent years, especially in capital investment.  From a peak of around 1,300 staff in the county council, we are down to fewer than 1,000 now.  That represents an almost 25% cut in our staff.  We have seen a dramatic collapse in capital investment across the county in roads, marine, water and sewerage infrastructure, yet we are told that this charge is for council services.  As we speak, we are seeing libraries and local community services being squeezed in partnership with the council.I discovered something last week that really concerns me, which is the statistics on payment that local authorities are putting out.  The grassroots group in Donegal that has campaigned against this charge quickly disproved a statement put out that 45% of the households had not paid.  They demonstrated that 63% of households in Donegal have not paid this charge.  Is the Minister of State seriously going to bring them all to court?  Will he criminalise two thirds of households in Donegal and half of the households of this State?The leaks to the national media in recent weeks that Revenue officials will be deployed to collect the charge - the whole thing is a farce at the moment - clearly demonstrates that this whole project has not worked.  Will the Government learn from these lessons and take the opportunity to engage constructively with us over the next two evenings, or will it replace the stick with an even bigger stick from Revenue?  The idea of taking money directly from PAYE workers has met with some resistance from the chairperson of the Labour Party, Deputy Keaveney.  I am not sure if he did a solo run or if that is the policy of the Labour Party.  If it is the policy of the Labour Party that it will not support the deployment of Revenue officials, it will be an interesting battle between the two Government parties on how to resolve this.  They are all over the place on this issue.  It is clear the people who voted Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the last election have been let down and have rejected this.I can only speak for Donegal.  I am really proud that two thirds of the people of Donegal have not paid this charge.  All sorts of pressure was applied to them and it is remarkable they have taken that decision.  Donegal was historically a very conservative county.  These are people who never wanted to protest and never imagined they would not make a contribution, as it was presented, to their local council, but that is what they have done.  People of a similar vein across the State have clearly made the same decision.I ask the Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies to take the opportunity to engage constructively with all of us who oppose this charge and work out alternatives, because such alternatives exist.  Sinn Féin presents such alternatives before every budget and we will do it again later this year.  We will show them alternative routes to meet the targets they have to meet.  There are choices.  They do not have to make these choices.  This has failed.  There will be failures and successes in government, but the key challenge is to accept the failures and move on.  This has been a failure.  The Government needs to change direction and look at some other way of gathering resources.  There is flexibility under the troika programme to do that, so it should take that opportunity.Are the Minister of State and his colleagues seriously suggesting tonight and tomorrow that they will go after hundreds of thousands of households in this State that they know to be honourable, decent people?  Will they go down the road of bringing them before the courts and criminalising them?  They know they will not do that, so let us walk away from this household charge, reimburse the people who paid it and look at a fairer way of achieving this.Even the IMF - not a bastion of global social justice - has stated that the Government has to find a fairer way of doing this.  I will leave it to the Minister of State and his colleagues to make their choices, but they face serious problems.  The chairperson of the Labour Party has stated his party will oppose this going through Revenue.  I wonder will they honour this promise.  The Government is facing a battle on all fronts, so it should walk away from this and change direction.	spk_328

However, we agree with each of the proposals and will accept them.  It is ironic they have been lumped together, even though it was not planned like this.  One proposal is to provide for a permanent emergency funding mechanism and reflects the failure of European monetary union, the failure of solidarity, the failure of the structure to deal with the crisis, the failure of those in the banking sector to take responsibility for the crisis they created and the failure to restructure the banking and financial sector.  As we speak, the Spanish Government and the Spanish people will be given money to bail out their banks without any rigorous stress testing of the banking sector.  The same mistakes have been repeated and they do not meet their responsibilities.  It is ironic that we have that provision in the amendment as well as the accession of Croatia.Good luck to Croatia, which is very welcome.  It has been a long journey for its people to get to this point.  What kind of European Union is Croatia entering and what kind of solidarity can it expect when a potential crisis emerges?  The Irish people were saddled with banking debt that will have an impact on generations, with no answer to our difficulties.  If that experience is anything to go by, this is a difficult time for Croatia to enter the Union.On a hopeful note, we need to go back to basics.  The European Union project has many positive elements, such as the binding together of peoples who were in an awful conflict.  Croatia is part of the Balkans and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo gave birth to the dreadful First World War and, because lessons were not learned from mistakes, the devastation of the dreadful Second World War followed.  The hopeful project of the European Union followed and included social Europe, women's rights, environmental legislation, equality and human rights.  All of these have been achieved and there has been solidarity at times.  The project has potential to be a great, hopeful project but this is not a good time for it.  With the exception of Croatia, it might remind us to go back to what the project was supposed to be about.  With that positive development next year, it might focus our minds on what we need to do in Europe and what solidarity means.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak and we will support the four items in the Bill.	spk_262
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-06-06	dail	31	European Council: Statements	dbsect_14	"When the Taoiseach spoke to us last before the informal Council meeting he warned that at this Council meeting, ""The intention is that we will not at this stage take decisions or draw conclusions.""  Why would the Council take decisions, given the current situation where unemployment is sky high across Europe and when there are queues for soup kitchens in many places, not just in Greece?  I would suggest that the inconvenience of a referendum in this State may have had something to do with the reluctance of EU leaders to put their plans down on paper before the austerity treaty was passed here because we were told the treaty was the bad cop that we had to see before we could see the good cop of investment and a growth plan.The treaty has been passed and the clear differences in attitude among the less well-off section of our people towards it has been brought to light.  Post the informal Council, is it time to ask the Government to show its hand and state clearly what it is looking for in terms of a growth plan?According to a report published this year by the International Monetary Fund, less government spending during periods of economic contraction lowers incomes in the short term and raises unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment.  The report's authors reached this conclusion after examining 173 episodes of government-imposed fiscal austerity over the past 30 years, with the average deficit reduction equal to 1% of GDP.They found that a 1% deficit cut had the effect of reducing real incomes by about 0.6% and raised unemployment by nearly 0.5%, and it gets worse.  The IMF report also found that in cases where governments chose to pursue austerity programmes instead of deficit spending, income and employment levels frequently did not return to pre-recession levels even after five years.  Recovery was even more painful when multiple countries tried to impose austerity measures simultaneously, as is currently happening in the eurozone, since not every country can devalue its currency to boost exports at the same time.With that in mind, I suppose we need to get to the crux of the issue.  What is the Government's negotiating position?  What does it regard as an adequate stimulus package to get the Irish economy moving?I asked the Taoiseach the following questions on the previous occasion.  Is the Government promoting or supporting an increase in the investment capacity of the European Investment Bank and if so, to what level?  Chancellor Merkel and her Government's submission for the next Council meeting at the end of June amounts to approximately €10 billion for all of Europe.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has talked about a package of €10 billion for Ireland alone, which has a population of less than 1% of the European Union.  If that is the sort of ball park Chancellor Merkel is in, the Taoiseach would need seriously to challenge that."	spk_166

That is fair enough.  That is democracy.  However, the Government also has a huge responsibility to deliver.  The Taoiseach will be aware that a considerable section of the Irish people who voted ""Yes"" did so with gritted teeth and with a concern around future funding.  I understand their concerns.  Their hope is with this renewed chance and mandate that the Taoiseach has been given to go and get that deal once and for all.  This is the moment of truth.  It is here in front of us.  Now we must have a deal on banking debt.  We must have a real strategy for growth and investment.  This will be the Government's litmus test in the next period.The Government has not done negotiating to date and does not stand up for Ireland.  Maybe, for the sake of clarity, the Taoiseach would outline what exactly the Government regards as an adequate stimulus package.  What would be required?  Is it the roll-out of next generation broadband?  Is there a programme of school building?  Are there road projects, such as the A5 road to Donegal and Derry?  What are the projects?  What is the strategy?  How many jobs will be created?  We need to see the detail.  We need to know what the Taoiseach is looking for at European level and what strategic alliances he is seeking to build at European level.We are told the EU master plan has three arms.  The first is the one we know all too well.  It is euphemistically referred to as having ""sound public finances"".  In reality, what this means is a complete ideological inflexibility to consider anything except austerity as a way out of Europe's economic trough.  It is this policy that has seen the return of mass emigration to Ireland and has left one in two young Spaniards unemployed.  It should be yesterday's policy but new life has been breathed into it in this country by harnessing the fear of the people.  It is the policy adopted from day one of this crisis which, despite its obvious failure, is still somehow being championed by the German Chancellor and foisted upon others under threat of deadly consequences.  This arm of the plan does not work.  We know this because Greece has had a second bailout and Portugal and this country have more or less admitted they will need a second bailout because the first one, and its austerity, did not work.On a side point, one area where the EU has sought to make an impact, at least in terms of the media, is on youth unemployment.I am hopeful that this is one area where the Taoiseach may be able to expand on what initiatives were discussed or will be discussed at June's meeting.  My colleague, Senator Kathryn Reilly, has tried to get some clarity on this, even to the extent of making a freedom of information request.  We need clarity and detail on the Government's strategy in terms of stimulus and bank write-down of debt.We are told that ""structural reforms"" comprise the second arm of the grand plan.  What are these structural reforms?  We are relying on titbits of information and some guess work.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can enlighten us to what is being proposed here and what position the Government will take.What guarantee has he got or is he looking for that this structural reform will not merely be more of the neo-liberal policies favoured by the EU Commission over the last decade?  How is the Government positioning itself to reject any moves towards lowering of wages across the EU in the name of competitiveness?How much has civil society, in particular the trade unions, been consulted about these so-called reforms?  Experience has taught us that when this EU Commission speaks of ""labour market reforms"" workers should worry and organise themselves.What does the Taoiseach say to the press speculation that has Germany pushing for further privatisation of state enterprises?  Is this something on which the Government will take a stand or is it on-board with the destruction of the State, asset by asset?"	spk_170

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-06-06	dail	31	European Communities (Amendnment) Bill 2012: Second Stage	dbsect_30	It is typical of the chaotic approach that has been taken by the EU leadership over a period that this Bill comes before us today in this form.  From day one of this crisis, there has been no joined-up and thought-out attempt to deal with the core issues causing this significant social catastrophe for people across Europe.  The rule book has been thrown out the window, along with the community method.  When the rules do not suit, it seems the EU now ignores them.  Britain and the Czech Republic now find themselves half-divorced from the rest of the Union, something we were told for decades would never be allowed to happen.There has only been one approach tried by the EU with this and previous Governments, which is austerity at all costs, and it has been a failure.  It reflects extremely poorly on this Government and once again it has clearly been out-negotiated, allowing itself to accept a blackmail link between the proposed ESM and the austerity treaty.  It failed to stand up for Ireland at every point in this crisis, and that performance is continuing as the Irish people are still paying dearly for the failure of the elected leaders.  We should be clear that this is a bad way to make law and it is constitutionally questionable.We call on the Government to publish its legal advice from the Attorney General on this matter.  Sinn Féin does not agree with the use of the controversial simplified revision procedure, Article 48.6 of the Treaty on the European Union, to make this amendment.  Treaty changes should be arrived at through democratic dialogue and should not be rushed through loopholes.  This smacks of backroom dealing and does nothing to inspire confidence among our citizens in the EU and its decision-making procedure.  The self-amending clause, as it is called, was inserted into EU law in the Lisbon treaty.  Sinn Féin opposed it then and warned it could be used to rush through unpopular and ill-thought out decisions of significant importance without the normal level of scrutiny and democratic debate.  We have been proven correct on that point.Will the Government explain why this route was chosen over the standard approach?  Why did it choose the option that allows the least scrutiny and debate?  Sinn Féin is in favour of a fund that can be used as a last resort for states blocked from borrowing on the markets.  Such an idea ties in with our vision of a Europe which offers genuine solidarity to members when they are in need.  We are not willing to support any old stability mechanism.  We will not support a bankers' mechanism or one hitched to the train of austerity.  Such a mechanism is of no use to the ordinary people of Europe in the medium and long run.The ESM will inherit many of the failings of its predecessor, the European Financial Stability Facility.  There is some hope and time to allow for an improvement in what is being proposed, and the Spanish Government is seeking changes.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, will outline in detail tomorrow Sinn Féin's position on the ESM so I will not elaborate on it greatly now.  Needless to say, it is not Sinn Féin's ideal solution.  We would prefer to see the European Central Bank empowered to act as a lender of last resort, with the ability to recapitalise banks where necessary.  This is not a realistic political option at this point.  As usual, during the crisis, alternatives seemingly are not considered as the system must be protected at all costs.Greece, Spain and possibly Cyprus, as well as this State, are likely to require emergency funding in the near future.  We hope that by supporting this amendment, despite our criticism of how it was arrived at, the EU and our Government will take the opportunity to re-examine the options available and use this facility to create an emergency funding vehicle that matches the needs of citizens.  That would be a major step forward in providing stability to the eurozone and the real economy.  That is why we are supporting this Bill on Second Stage.There are two additional items to be added on Committee Stage.  I convey Sinn Féin's support for the Croatian accession treaty protocol.  It has been a long journey for the Croatian people and in the European affairs and foreign affairs committee there has been a long dialogue dealing with these issues.  We have maintained a very active interest in the affairs of the western Balkans.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade knows our concerns about Serbia and Bosnia.  There is an ongoing position in Serbia where homosexual rights activists cannot hold an event to celebrate their rights, which is completely contrary to the progressive culture that is inherent in the European Union.  There is also a concern about the approach of the Serbian Government in destabilising Bosnia.  Lord Ashdown has been here to outline his concerns, having played a leading role in the region.  Croatia is a good news story but before we can see the story replicated by other states in the western Balkans we must deal with certain challenges.  Baroness Catherine Ashton, the external affairs representative for the European Union, will have a challenge in that region and although there has been a fair bit of criticism, I hope the issues can be resolved soon.It was indicated that once Croatia takes up its place in the European Union, there will be access to our domestic labour markets.  Ireland should be quite embarrassed about how we have treated the Romanian and Bulgarian citizens, as we have not given them the same rights as other eastern European countries which acceded to the European Union.  There was a second opportunity recently for our Government to remedy that injustice and we failed to do so again.  I do not anticipate that the Croatian citizens will enjoy those rights but I am hopeful the Government will review the decision it has made on Romanian and Bulgarian citizens.  That would demonstrate true European solidarity and give those citizens the same rights as other members of the European Union.  It is welcome.I could comment mischievously about the protocol relating to the concerns of the Irish people about the first Lisbon treaty.  I will withhold my comments.	spk_282

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-05-23	dail	31	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_29	Yesterday, there was a debacle in County Donegal when officials from Revenue and agents acting on its behalf sought to remove machinery from Highland Bakery, which is located on the outskirts of Letterkenny.  The employees working there then barricaded themselves in and a stand-off ensued between Revenue officials and the staff there.  The background to this matter is that like many good businesses, the owner has got into difficulties and owes money to Revenue.  While he does not dispute this, the issue is how can a sustainable repayment plan be arrived at.  At present, the owner, Kevin Bradley, is being asked to repay €20,000 per month, which is not sustainable.  The question and dilemma for Revenue is there are 28 workers and 15 drivers involved, making 43 employees in total.  If one multiplies that number by the €20,000 per year each it would cost the State, the final amount this would cost the State per year runs to hundreds of thousands of euro.  I appeal to the Revenue Commissioners to engage immediately with the owner, who has assured Deputy Doherty and I that he wants to resolve this issue and maintain his business, in respect of which he has a full order book.  Like many other businesses, while previously he was paid upon delivery it is often a month or longer now before he gets paid.  As such, he has difficulties with cash flow.I assure the Minister that the owner wants to repay what he owes but on a sustainable basis.  I appreciate that Revenue has a job to do and that the taxes it collects are required to run our health and education services and so on.  However, I appeal to the Minister and his officials to intervene to resolve this problem and, more important, to ensure jobs are saved in Donegal, where, as the Minister will be aware, there is a huge problem in terms of unemployment and emigration.  The business concerned has been successful and can continue to be successful with some assistance from the Minister.	spk_412
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-05-23	dail	31	Schools Building Projects	dbsect_29	I thank the Minister for his response.  I accept that the Minister is unable to intervene for legal reasons.  However, it is, as Deputy Doherty pointed out, critical in the case of Highland Bakery that Revenue look at the wider impact of an unsustainable repayment plan.  The cost to the State, in terms of social welfare payments if the 42 employees lose their jobs, will be €20,000 per person or €800,000 per annum, which is multiples of the amount owed.  Surely, it makes sense for Revenue to put in place a sustainable repayment plan.The business owner was recently involved in an accident, which may have caused some difficulties in terms of communications.  While I accept that Revenue must be independent of the political system, it is hoped it will listen to our views in terms of the economic environment and our belief that this matter can be resolved.  It is hoped that following this unfortunate stand-off, which is not in anybody's interests, Revenue will engage with the business owner and agree on a sustainable repayment plan that is in everybody's interest.	spk_415

The background to this matter is that like many good businesses, the owner has got into difficulties and owes money to Revenue.  While he does not dispute this, the issue is how can a sustainable repayment plan be arrived at.  At present, the owner, Kevin Bradley, is being asked to repay €20,000 per month, which is not sustainable.  The question and dilemma for Revenue is there are 28 workers and 15 drivers involved, making 43 employees in total.  If one multiplies that number by the €20,000 per year each it would cost the State, the final amount this would cost the State per year runs to hundreds of thousands of euro.  I appeal to the Revenue Commissioners to engage immediately with the owner, who has assured Deputy Doherty and I that he wants to resolve this issue and maintain his business, in respect of which he has a full order book.  Like many other businesses, while previously he was paid upon delivery it is often a month or longer now before he gets paid.  As such, he has difficulties with cash flow.I assure the Minister that the owner wants to repay what he owes but on a sustainable basis.  I appreciate that Revenue has a job to do and that the taxes it collects are required to run our health and education services and so on.  However, I appeal to the Minister and his officials to intervene to resolve this problem and, more important, to ensure jobs are saved in Donegal, where, as the Minister will be aware, there is a huge problem in terms of unemployment and emigration.  The business concerned has been successful and can continue to be successful with some assistance from the Minister.	spk_412
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-05-23	dail	31	Tax Collection	dbsect_31	I thank the Minister for his response.  I accept that the Minister is unable to intervene for legal reasons.  However, it is, as Deputy Doherty pointed out, critical in the case of Highland Bakery that Revenue look at the wider impact of an unsustainable repayment plan.  The cost to the State, in terms of social welfare payments if the 42 employees lose their jobs, will be €20,000 per person or €800,000 per annum, which is multiples of the amount owed.  Surely, it makes sense for Revenue to put in place a sustainable repayment plan.The business owner was recently involved in an accident, which may have caused some difficulties in terms of communications.  While I accept that Revenue must be independent of the political system, it is hoped it will listen to our views in terms of the economic environment and our belief that this matter can be resolved.  It is hoped that following this unfortunate stand-off, which is not in anybody's interests, Revenue will engage with the business owner and agree on a sustainable repayment plan that is in everybody's interest.	spk_415

It is a brush stroke history of Ireland, and I always enjoy the part about the lead up to the 1916 Rising, its aftermath and what it meant for the Irish people.  Juxtapose the slaughter in the Somme not long after the Rising in which Irish Unionists and Nationalists were slaughtered - more than 20,000 people were killed in one day, on 1 July 1916, and over 30,000 were injured in a foolish slaughter driven by king or kaiser - with Connolly's Irish Citizen Army and its famous banner, ""We serve neither King nor Kaiser but Ireland.""  They were visionaries.  It was a fusion of radicals, visionaries, cultural revivalists and feminists.Consider the first words of the Proclamation: ""Irishmen and Irishwomen"".  At a time when women did not even have a vote, that was a radical statement of intent.  They were poets, visionaries, trade unionists, suffragettes, cultural revivalists and people who were trying to fight for all that is good.  Read the Proclamation.  There is no nation on earth that would not be proud of the words in it.  There is no hint of sectarianism or hate.  It is about unity, fairness, equality and decency.  It is a platform not just for Irish humanity but for world humanity.  Those leaders inspired people across the world.  We know the British Empire was an unjust empire, but the world was an unjust place as could be seen in the World War taking place at that time.  It was a disaster in which working class people were slaughtered in fields in their hundreds of thousands and millions.Our heroes, however, were not acting for popularity.  They were visionaries.  As they were led away they were jeered, but in a few short years the Irish people would realise what a wonderful legacy they had been given and would endorse in the first Dáil the 1916 Proclamation in their programme for government.  That is our inheritance, and it is a wonderful inheritance.  In 2012, however, much of that inheritance has been squandered.  We have an economic crisis because we abandoned the ideals which they represented and gave to us.  Knowing all that we know now about the greed that caused this crisis, are we really going to allow these buildings to be torn asunder?I, too, had the honour of walking the route of Henry Place, Moore Lane and Moore Street.  The hair stood on the back of my neck at the thought of these amazing and unbelievably courageous people being evacuated from the GPO and being led eventually into Moore Street, where they surrendered.  Their spirit was defeated and they probably thought their struggle was defeated.  If they only knew what they gave birth to.  It is a wonderful story to tell, not just to Irish people but also to visitors from throughout the world.  People around the world have looked at our history, and anybody who has had the privilege of travelling across the world will recall seeing the glint in people's eyes when they have told them they are Irish.  Despite all our economic problems and the damage to our reputation, the stories people around the world think of are those of the 1916 Rising and Bobby Sands.  That is what inspires them and gives them hope in their own struggles.Now, when we have a chance to set this nation and island back in the right direction after the mess caused by greed, let us grasp the opportunity to do all we can to seize those buildings and send a signal that we value our inheritance and those who gave birth to what we have today, and that we intend to complete their journey.  That is the challenge for the Members of this House.  Can all Members of the House, of all political colours and creeds, unite on this issue?  Then, perhaps, we would deserve the legacy we have been given."	spk_539

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-05-22	dail	31	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_22	"Everybody is for growth now.  It is wonderful that everybody has been converted to the jobs and growth agenda.  The Nobel Prize-winning economist, Professor Paul Krugman, did not need to write all those articles and get so upset after all.  We were slowly realising that Professor Krugman and all the other economists who were looking at the situation, including Professor Stiglitz and Dr. Roubini, actually had a point.When it was announced that a referendum campaign would be necessary, the choice to be made by the leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Martin, was an obvious one.  He could not campaign against this treaty or against failed right-wing austerity policies being enshrined in our Constitution.  When he was a Cabinet Minister, his Government was the architect of these policies in Ireland, which led to our failure to deal with the banking crisis.  If Deputy Martin had campaigned against austerity during a television debate with the Tánaiste or the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, he would have been laughed out of the studio.  Everybody at home would have been laughing as well.  He made a pragmatic choice, in the interests of his own party, to align himself with the Government during this campaign.  He should not accuse anybody of putting party before the State, or ""the country"" as he referred to it.  It is all a bit of a nonsense, is it not?In terms of the issue of growth, we in Sinn Féin have clearly said that these policies of austerity are failing in Ireland and across Europe.  We just cannot cut our way out of a recession.  When the Taoiseach returns home to Mayo, no doubt he talks to small businesses on the ground and no doubt they are telling him that if money is sucked from low to middle income workers and resources are taken from the people who sustain the domestic economy, then small businesses and the domestic economy will be strangled.It was an insane policy to pursue but, unfortunately, it was pursued.  Not only was it pursued but we sought to put in place a treaty and give constitutional protection to these policies so we would tie the hands of future Governments.  Thankfully, somebody has said that the emperor has no clothes, and that somebody now, most important, is the President of France, Mr. Francois Hollande.  During his campaign he stated that, if elected, he would not ratify this treaty as it is and he would seek to develop a growth strategy.  When we raised this point, we were shouted down by the Government.  Now, thankfully and helpfully, the French Minister, Mr. Pierre Moscovici, has repeated that point and made it clear that they will not ratify this treaty as it is and that there has to be a renegotiation.I have to ask the question why our Government is so enthusiastically supporting yesterday's European Union.  Why have we supported this treaty?  Why have we not called for a renegotiation of this treaty?  I certainly have not heard that yet.  Why have we not called for changes to the text to promote growth?  Why is that the Irish people have to rely on a French President to do the work for us and to act in our interests?  Why is it that our Government, in which our people put so much hope, has not done that?Now that there is a serious renegotiation of the treaty between France and Germany, we need to know the following.  Is the Government involved in those negotiations?  Are we now, as we speak, defending Ireland's interests or are we leaving it to the larger states once again to speak for us?  Is the Government promoting eurobonds, a financial transaction tax and a bank lending licence for the European financial stability facility?  If so, what are the details of the proposals being supported by the Government?  Is the Government promoting or supporting an increase in the investment capacity of the European Investment Bank and, if so, to what level?  Is the Government supporting changing the investment rules of the European Investment Bank and, in particular, the 50:50 ratio, which Sinn Féin had said it would like to see at 75:25?  Can the House imagine what we could do with our National Pensions Reserve Fund allied to those funds in terms of driving forward our economy?It is very important the Government outlines what is its strategy.  An article by Mr. Fintan O'Toole in To me, ""Yes"" is a positive and is something we should embrace.  Yet, I have heard no positivity coming from Government in regard to this because Government members know that what would remain if they left out the threats and had to debate the merits of yesterday's European Union - of a treaty that represents a political ideology that is now being taken out across Europe.  If we look at France, President Hollande has won, and in Germany, the Social Democrats, who have said they will not work with this, had a very significant success in the most recent regional elections, particularly in Rhine-Westphalia.  If we look at local elections in Italy and Britain, it is clear that parties which oppose this approach of ""austerity only"" have been successful.  The tide has turned, the game has changed, yet the Taoiseach is still presenting the old game.  If he is not, could he outline to us at some opportunity, hopefully in debate with Deputy Gerry Adams on some television show in the not too distant future, what is his strategy for growth and what is the other part?  The Taoiseach keeps saying this treaty is only part of the picture.  What is the other part of the picture?  Before he asks our people to enshrine in our Constitution - our precious and robust Constitution - protection for these policies, could we see the full picture?  We would like to know where the Taoiseach is at with this.Before I pass over to my deputy leader, I wish to address the issue of sovereignty.  Would it not be nice to have a bit of truth?  The Taoiseach famously said he wanted to be the Taoiseach who returns economic sovereignty to the Irish people - that was one of his big calls."	spk_335

I commend him for the excellent job of co-chairing what was a most successful gathering of the assembly in the Seanad Chamber earlier this week.  The BIPA has been in existence for 20 years.  Much has changed on this island and between these islands during these two decades, much of it for the good.  This is especially the case with the peace process in the North.  With the dawn of peace and the end to hostilities, people have had the time and space to get to know each other and to understand each other a good deal better, especially the Unionist and republican communities in the North.  The imagery of Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness travelling to America together seeking inward investment for their people, and then Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness doing likewise, is powerful.  Many events have taken place in recent times that were successful.  I acknowledge that the initiative that saw the Queen of England come here last year was a success and a sign that the relationship between the peoples of these islands is healing.In terms of what we do with that, it is now time to take it to the next level.  I know Deputy Joe McHugh, as a representative of the people of Donegal North East, would share that view.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, also represents the people of Donegal.  We know the impact of partition on our county and how the potential of our county was hampered by having two health services, two education systems and two taxation systems.  Effectively, we had two economies back to back in that small region and we need to break that down step by step.We have had positive developments such as the sharing of cancer services with Altnagelvin hospital going ahead.  That was a cross-party, cross-community campaign and even when it appeared to be under threat from the northern end, Unionists and Nationalists, all political colours and creeds, stood together and defended that important piece of health infrastructure for our region.  That was only right because there are half a million people in the north west of Ireland, and we need the same equality as everybody else.In terms of the A5 project, we now have motorways from Dublin to Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Belfast, and rightly so, but we need the same infrastructure coming into the north west of Ireland.  Derry is the fourth largest city on the island.  Half a million people live in the north west.  We have a population broadly similar to the south west and we need the same infrastructure.  We are looking for equality, nothing less or nothing more.  That objective must be advanced, and we can do that through the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.More important than addressing the deficits in the north west caused by partition and the Administrations in Dublin and Belfast not seeing our part of the island is the potential for the all-island economy.  I had the honour of serving on the board of InterTrade Ireland for more than three years where I saw academic institutions in the North being connected to businesses in the south, and vice versa.  It had a vision for all-Ireland infrastructure, preparing for a population of 8 million by 2020, and people combining their skills.  This is a small island of 6 million people.  It is interesting that there is no opposition within unionism for what Unionists call common sense co-operation in terms of building an all-Ireland economy, harmonising our approach to taxation and having a joint approach whenever we go overseas.  We should not have a situation where Invest Northern Ireland, IDA Ireland or Enterprise are singing from different hymn sheets when they promote job creation overseas.  We should promote the potential of the entire island.  We should bring together science parks and academic links, and do everything we can to join up the dots of this island because we are in this together.  That is the key objective of the BIPA.We also need to develop our understanding of each other as a people.  For hundreds of years there has been conflict between our peoples.  It is only in recent times that we have had breathing space.  There must be that development of that relationship.  I am also conscious that the BIPA includes representatives of the Northern Assembly, the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Assembly, the Isle of Man and Jersey but the Northern, Welsh and Scottish Assemblies represent democracy being brought closer to people and giving them a sense of identity and purpose with which we in Ireland can work in partnership.  When one has conversations with Assembly members from Scotland and Wales the sense of connectedness they have with Ireland is interesting.We must look increasingly at the BIPA as an assembly that can deliver, that has teeth, stands together and speaks with one voice on key objectives.  I suggest that an all-Ireland economy, addressing the infrastructure deficit in the north west of Ireland, sharing health and education services and making use of the resources we have in an intelligent, common sense way must be at the top of the assembly's agenda to be addressed in the foreseeable future.I commend the Co-Chairman who did an excellent job.  It was a well put together, high level session attended by the Taoiseach down to all the Ministers, a range of civil society players and business players who spoke about practical ways we can co-operate and who were generous in taking a wide range of questions.  The amount of time given by senior politicians in Ireland to engage on the different issues was noticeable.  I agree with the previous speaker that the bar has been set high for the next session in Glasgow, and we can take it from there.  Well done to the Co-Chairman, and I look forward to working on a practical basis to see what we can develop together through the assembly.	spk_260

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-05-10	dail	31	Ireland’s Chairmanship-in-Office of the OSCE: Statements	dbsect_7	I welcome the opportunity to discuss Ireland's chairmanship of the OSCE and the opportunities this presents.  Despite the damage to our reputation caused by the economic crisis of recent years, our legacy in terms of our leadership on human rights and overseas aid has held true to us.  I refer to our role in terms of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty and the foundation of the UN and the fact we have had Nobel prize winners, such as Seán McBride, John Hume and David Trimble, and a High Commissioner for Human Rights, Dr. Mary Robinson.  For a small island of 6 million people and a small State of 4.5 million people, our legacy is tremendous.  The more one travels, the more feedback one gets and we could play a role as an honest broker and as a facilitator between our umbilical brothers and sisters in the United States - a relationship built on emigration - and the rest of the world.There is sense - I sought counsel on this from people in NGOs and so on - that there could be duplication.  There needs to be a clear delineation of responsibilities.  What is the role of the UN, NATO and OSCE in conflict resolution?  We need to clearly delineate the lines between, and the roles given to, those distinct organisations.  The last thing one needs is duplication when one is trying to address conflict resolution.  One perfect example of Europe's failure is the Israel-Palestine crisis.  Since the Oslo Accord, the Israeli state has proceeded with the illegal settlements in the West Bank, in particular.  A recent leaked reported from EU rapporteurs on the ground showed that the Jewish population in what is called area C, where these settlements are being built, has increased from approximately 120,000 to 500,000.  The Palestinian population has rapidly declined and some UN reports have referred to it as ethnic cleansing.  It is in defiance of international law and yet Europe continues to maintain the favourable trade relationship with Israel.  It actually rewards Israel for that approach.Similarly, in regard to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty, all the focus is on Iran.  Iran, like all signatories, must meet its responsibilities under that treaty but Israel is not even a signatory to it.  There are only three countries which are not signatories to that treaty, namely, Pakistan, India and Israel.  However, we will focus on Israel for now.  It is clearly in possession of hundreds of nuclear warheads and yet there is no focus on it whatsoever or no sanctions.  Indeed, it is rewarded.  Unless there is consistency in the application of the rule of international law by Europe, then its moral weight in that region is severely impacted on.  Of course, that has a knock-on effect in the region.There is a real opportunity for Europe with the Arab spring.  I had the privilege to visit Tunisia for a number of days and to experience at first hand the potential of the Arab spring there.  Compared to other uprisings, it was quite remarkable.  It took a number of weeks to eventually overthrow Ben Ali.  Tragically, there were more than 300 deaths but that was nothing compared to what it took others to win their freedom from a dictators.  In that country, there is a moderate forum for Islam in the personification of Ennahda, the party which won the most support in the elections to the constituent assembly there where secular and moderate Islam work side by side.  Tunisia has the potential to be a template which proves that there is the capacity within Islam and Arab countries to have moderate democracy which recognises the rights and entitlements of all citizens.  Tunisia is working on a constitution and is one of the European Union's closest neighbours on the African continent.  The Tánaiste was in Tunis as part of the peace initiative in regard to Syria and met the leaders there, including the prime minister.  It is really is a superb template.I refer to the situation in Bahrain where the regime had a recent commercial success with the Formula One race going ahead in defiance of the Shia majority in that state.  A human rights leader there, who is supported by front line defenders in this country, is on hunger strike.  He is a wonderful man of peace who is dying and yet there is total inaction by the West.  The regime in Bahrain presents itself as one which has something to tell the people of Syria.  There are so many inconsistencies in the way Europe and the West apply themselves to the region.Our track record in the promotion of human rights, our proclaimed neutrality, although it has been undermined in recent years with the use of Shannon for aeroplanes stopping off on the way to war in the Gulf, our defence of human rights and our honourable track record in overseas aids mean that with the chairmanship of OSCE, we have the chance to promote our status and to play a role beyond the NATO states in Europe.I was not aware of the conference on focusing on the lessons learned in the North.  That was an excellent initiative bringing hundreds of people from the area covered by the OSCE here to learn those lessons.  We need to see more of that.There needs to be a forceful confrontation in regard to Belarus.  I know there are sanctions and so on in place but we need to pursue the issue of Belarus during our term.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, will know, Paddy Ashdown appeared before a joint meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on European Union Affairs and Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He was very concerned about the situation in Bosnia.  He referred to Bosnia as being the poster boys of that process but he worries that the leader of the Bosnian Serbs is undermining the continued peace.  As we know, Bosnia is very divided on ethnic grounds, with the Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and so on.  That country suffered horrendously during the war there.  The leader of the Bosnian Serbs denies those dreadful atrocities took place.  I urge the Tánaiste to use his position - I know the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, will engage in a range of meetings in the countries in that region - and to take a leadership role in that situation, to try to help it along and listen to the advice of people like Paddy Ashdown, who is very concerned about the undermining of the advances made in the region.It is an honour to hold the chairmanship of the organisation but I urge the Government to use that term to further strengthen Ireland's reputation and to take courageous initiatives in those areas which have been failed, whether within the OSCE or outside it in the context of the Arab spring and Israel-Palestine, and to advance them, separately if needs be.	spk_209
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-05-09	dail	31	EU Presidency: Statements	dbsect_4	"It has been an interesting week in Europe with local elections in Britain, Italy and Germany where parties calling for a new direction against austerity have been endorsed by the electorate.  More important, France has a new president who has campaigned against austerity without any plan for jobs and growth.  In Greece, we have seen an historic election in which the people have rejected austerity.  In France and Greece in particular it has been a victory for hope over fear.  Yet our Government is conducting a campaign for an intergovernmental treaty, not an EU one, which is based on fear.  It is based on the idea of saying ""It's not much of a treaty but, sure, we're going to have to say ‘Yes' to get future funding"".We have the spectacle of our Tánaiste jetting out to Paris seeking to be part of the celebrations there.  One could not write the script.  On numerous occasions in this Chamber, I have appealed to the Tánaiste and his colleagues to listen to social democratic, left-wing and trade union voices across Europe who have opposed this crazy austerity policy.  It is failing and is pushing people into the margins and despair, particularly in Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal.  No doubt other countries will join them.Here we are on Europe Day but where is the solidarity?  Where is the real sense of us all being Europeans together?  Where has the real vision gone?  The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, wants to have it all ways.  She wants to have trade surpluses in her country and wants to maintain competitiveness as well as boosting exports.  She does not want to drive up domestic demand that could assist the European project.  At the same time, she tells her own people that we were all reckless and feckless on the periphery, and if only we could be more prudent like the Germans we would not be in this mess.  She does not tell them, however, that the Landesbank and other German banks were up to their necks in this crisis.  Without due diligence, regulation or any management sense, they recklessly stuffed money into the periphery - particularly in Ireland, into private banks - and have asked our people to take that burden.Here we are on Europe Day but it is a bit of a charade because the Government is all over the place.  The Fine Gael Party wanted Sarkozy to win the French presidential election, because his UMP is a sister party of Fine Gael's.  Meanwhile, the Tánaiste is diving over to Paris to get photographed, if possible, with the victorious  team there.  He wants to rewrite the narrative that all along he was opposed to austerity.They want to prove that all along they were fighting the good fight, agreeing with Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, Roubini, Sinn Féin, the United Left Alliance and all the other advocates of a new direction.  It will not fool anybody, however.  Maybe now is the time for reflection and courage.  It is the time to stand up for the national interest once and for all, and see that the tide has well and truly turned, as it was always going to.  People in Europe could only take so much of this.  They have started to fight back and have done so with immense civil disobedience.  Here in Ireland we have had mass resistance to the household charge.   In all reality we have already had a referendum on that issue and on austerity.  Perhaps now finally we can have an Irish Government that will stand up for our interests, give our people hope and reverse this madness."	spk_158
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-05-09	dail	31	EU Presidency: Statements	dbsect_4	"I have two questions, which are themes of the campaign, as the Minister of State, will know when I put them to her.  The Government's plan A is to have a ""Yes"" vote on 31 May but a plan B may be required if the people vote ""No"".  Will the Minister of State give a commitment in that event that she will not allow the blackmail clause, as it is referred to, which links the austerity treaty, as we call it, to the ESM?  We have Article 136 and the amendments to it that give legal cover and sustenance for the ESM.  If it did not, the European governments would not have pursued it.  Why would one amend an article if it is not required?  Therefore, it is required to give legal force to the ESM.  This means the Government has the ability to use its unanimous veto to re-negotiate.  To be very clear, in the event of a ""No"" vote will the Government use this power to seek to remove this link which was introduced at the very last stages, is menacing and is blurring the debate we need to have?  There is a great amount of detail in Article 136 and the Government never answers the question so I am trying to make as clear as possible what is the question.It is estimated that meeting the 0.5% structural deficit will require an additional €6 billion of cuts or increased taxation.  How does the Minister of State propose to do this?"	spk_167

I sit here as a humble TD, listening to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Ministers asking for constructive proposals from the Opposition.  We have had a string of companies leaving workers high and dry, pursuing cases and often having to occupy the premises where they worked to secure justice.  Here we have constructive proposals; we do not claim they are perfect or all encompassing but they are a contribution.  I have looked through them and for the life of me I cannot see why there is any difficulty here.  A 60 day period in which the Employment Appeals Tribunal or Labour Court must decide or be accountable to the Minister; a review period every 30 days; a 60 day period after determination is made during which payment should be forthcoming to workers and, finally, lengthening the period of redundancy notification to reflect the size of the company.  Those are sensible and reasonable suggestions but they will be voted down.  Is it any wonder the public regard this place as a farce?  Every time the Opposition tries to provide some solutions, it gets swatted down.The most topical issue recently was the Private Members' motion that Sinn Féin tabled that asked the Government not to introduce the legislation for the European Stability Mechanism before the House until after the referendum.  That motion was voted down but now the Government has done exactly as we asked.  At times I scratch my head.I wish to talk about why my colleague, Deputy Tóibín, has brought this Bill before the House.  I am a Buncrana man from Donegal and in my small community there are two clear examples of why this is necessary.Clubman Omega was an Irish-owned textile manufacturer, a shirt factory that employed dedicated workers, in some cases for decades.  They agreed to work fewer hours and take pay cuts.  They did everything they could to sustain that company; they could not have been more loyal.  Eventually they were let go with statutory redundancy.  Those women picketed Clubman Omega in a county that at the time was renowned not for radical politics or pickets but for its conservatism.  Those women ended up setting a record for a strike in Donegal.  In pouring rain, hail and snow they were outside the factory to protest.  It was inspirational but sadly in the end they did not get what they were entitled to.Recently, we saw the same story in Seatem-owned ticket company Keith Prowse, which was based on the outskirts of Buncrana and which closed, leaving more than 100 workers who had given loyal service without a job.  There were numerous companies - Seatem (UK), Seatem (Donegal) and Seatem (Ireland) - and they closed down operations in Buncrana, leaving people high and dry, most of them women.  They have now had to wait a year and a half just to get their statutory entitlements sorted out.  They were not even issued with P45s.  The company started to refuse to take phone calls after a couple of weeks.   I was Mayor of Buncrana when this happened and I contacted the Minister about this.  We pulled all of the agencies together and in fairness some of those agencies performed well but the Government and the system failed those workers badly.  Some of them have still not received their entitlements.That is the human reality in a small town like Buncrana and it is replicated throughout the State.  I appeal to the Government to restore some faith among the public.  When it gets constructive, solution-oriented proposals, it could respond positively, do the right thing and back this Bill.We had a Labour Party TD bizarrely talking about the 1913 Lock Out and how Arthur Griffith of Sinn Féin did not stand by the workers.  That is why his grandfather said he should never vote for Sinn Féin.  God almighty, they talk about Civil War politics.	spk_390

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-04-19	dail	31	Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union) Bill 2012: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_36	"I will start by taking us back a few steps.  To understand where we are now, we must look at where we came from and how we got here.  Sinn Féin's criticism of the Maastricht treaty and the proposition of economic and monetary union related to the idea of a one size fits all policy working.  We said having a single interest rate for all of the eurozone would not work.  During our economic bubble, we could have done with raising interests to slow down the overheating of the economy that we are all paying for now in such a profound way.  Unfortunately that was not within our gift.  Economic policies served the interests of Germany, in particular, and other core states.The free flow of money from the core European banking system out into the periphery was another factor.  In Greece's case, this was done with the assistance of false reporting by Goldman Sachs on the strength of the Greek Government's sovereign capacity, and in Ireland's case it was done through investment in private banks.  The combination of artificially low interest rates and cheap credit in Ireland was like crack cocaine.  The average person watching television at home was told he or she would be crazy not to buy property, that house prices were only going one way and he must get on the train and be quick about it.  The practice of the old prudent bank manager, where he would lend three and a half or four times a person's annual salary where that person could provide a 10% deposit to prove he had the capacity to save, was thrown out the window while the moral hazard of incentives for bank managers for approving 100% plus mortgages and further loans was introduced.The crisis did not have its genesis in Irish folly and recklessness, although it was encouraged by the Government and economists and bankers whom we were told were prudent and sensible.  This mess is of its nature a European one caused by the distortions created by economic and monetary union.  When Europe was forced to face the reality that monetary union was failing badly, with a series of bailouts, it failed again.  Rather than countering the recessionary - even depressionary - cycle, it has gone the other way to become pro-cyclical.  It is an insane policy.This is a European crisis by design but has the burden been shared?  Absolutely not.If debt brakes and deficit ceilings could have solved or prevented the Irish economic crisis, I ask those on the ""Yes"" side to explain why, for most of the years of our membership of the eurozone, we stayed within the Maastricht criteria of a 3% deficit ceiling and 60% debt to GDP ratio.  It was only when we were saddled with the banking debt that we fell outside them.  Even those mechanisms failed to identify a fundamental failure in our economy.People have referred to the fact that 20% of our tax revenue came from construction alone.  It was out of kilter.  We were building 95,000 houses at the peak of the boom for a population of 4.5 million.  It was almost the same number as was being built in Britain, with a population of 60 million.  It did not take an economist to figure out that something was badly wrong, yet none of the Maastricht criteria succeeded in addressing those fundamental failures.  How will they work now?  If they had been the solution, we would not have had this crisis in the first place.In an article in Monday's When the bubble burst, the Spanish economy was left high and dry; Spain's fiscal problems are a consequence of its depression, not its cause.  Nonetheless, the prescription coming from Berlin and Frankfurt is, you guessed it, even more fiscal austerity.  This is, not to mince words, just insane... Rather than admit that they've been wrong, European leaders seem determined to drive their economy - and [just as importantly] their society - off a cliff.  And the whole world will pay the price.Krugman went on to criticise the fiscal treaty as locking in ""fiscal austerity as the response to any and all problems"".  Another Nobel Prize winner for economics, Joseph Stiglitz, has described the European response to the crisis as a ""mutual suicide pact"".  That is very strong language for an eminent economist.  Their comments were echoed by yet another world renowned economist, Nouriel Roubini, who correctly forecast the current crash:Thanks to the fiscal compact, even the eurozone's core will be forced into front-loaded recessionary austerity... The trouble is that the eurozone has an austerity strategy but no growth strategy.  And, without that, all it has is a recession strategy that makes austerity and reform self-defeating, because, if output continues to contract, deficit and debt ratios will continue to rise to unsustainable levels.  Moreover, the social and political backlash eventually will become overwhelming.That is dramatic language from another internationally renowned economist analysing what is taking place in Europe.Krugman, Stiglitz and Roubini reflect a widespread view that the EU has misdiagnosed the economic crisis.  The proposed new treaty seeks to assign that misdiagnosis the status of constitutional law.  It is akin to a doctor prescribing an inappropriate treatment to a patient and then legally debarring the patient from exploring any alternative treatments.  This is why opposition to the treaty is growing across the eurozone, and it is those voices of opposition that I principally wish to draw to the attention of the House, not least because the voices from the rest of Europe that the House and its committees have heard from so far have all been in support of the treaty.  There is serious concern internationally and across Europe about the direction being taken.I wish to respond to some of the comments from the other side of the House about Sinn Féin's historical analysis.  It is as if Sinn Féin was on the margins of Europe in its constructive criticism of the direction Europe has been taking.  I argue that we are in the mainstream of social democratic or left wing thinking in Europe.  At times that is in the majority but currently it is in the minority.  However, in the near future it will be back in the majority again, and we are right at the centre of it in our analysis of the dismantling of social Europe.  Those who have a very right wing analysis believe in light-touch regulation, privatisation, liberalisation, breaking down public services and driving back workers' rights and entitlements.  That approach has led to this crisis.  We let the financial markets and the banks roam free and we now have this catastrophe in Ireland and in Europe.I will now focus on some of the commentary from across Europe.  Before doing so, however, I remind the House of the background to the first Lisbon treaty referendum in Ireland.  It did not come out of nowhere.  There was a proposition to have a European constitution, drafted by the mandarins and the elite in the corridors of Brussels and Strasbourg.  It was put to the people of France and meetings were held across that country in town halls, libraries and public buildings, but the people rejected the proposition.  It was not for xenophobic or regressive reasons but for progressive reasons.  They wanted to reclaim the vision of Europe that Francois Mitterand, Jacques Delors and others had, so they rejected the European constitution in the referendum.  The people of Holland did likewise.  It was only afterwards that Europe closed down the constitution and repackaged 98% of it into what was to become the Lisbon treaty.  The Irish people were the third to reject the proposition, and Sinn Féin was not alone on the fringes of Europe but at the centre of it in constructively and critically taking on those who were stealing the dream that was social Europe.With that in mind I will turn to some of the commentary in Europe on this treaty.  It is clear that when Sinn Féin calls on the Irish people to vote ""No"" to the treaty it is not to isolate Ireland from Europe but to strengthen our bonds with people across Europe who are sick and tired of austerity, unemployment and their public services being systematically dismantled.  There is a very good chance that Francois Hollande will be the next President of France.  We are familiar with the term ""Merkozy"", the partnership of Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy and how it has pushed forward and pushed everybody else aside.  That will come apart if Francois Hollande is elected.  Interestingly, the BBC reports today that he outlined a number of reasons for opposing the treaty and what he would seek to renegotiate it.  It included dropping plans to anchor deficit reduction rules in countries' constitutions.  That is a huge statement.  He is making clear, among other things, that to attach these arbitrary draconian targets, particularly to countries that are in a programme, are struggling and are saddled with banking debt, is insane.  This is possibly the next President of France, somebody with whom we will seek to build strategic alliances.Doctor Herta Daubler-Gmelin, a former Minister for Justice in the German Government, is pursuing a constitutional case for a referendum on the treaty, saying: ""I am all for Europe, just not one determined by political elites"".  Dr. H.J. Witteveen, a former Minister for Finance in the Netherlandsand a former director of the IMF, calls the treaty ""unreasonable and dangerous"".  Again, that is strong language.  The Social Democratic Party in Sweden has argued that, ""Sweden should not transfer power to decide on financial policy from Riksdagen [the national parliament], nor give the European Court of Justice the possibility to decide on sanctions on the basis of the Fiscal Compact"".  Also in Sweden, the EU legal expert of the national trade union confederation has said:Budget policy and financial policy is being dragged out of legitimate democratic institutions in favour of a supranational technocracy.  Democracy at the national level is being hollowed out, and it is not replaced by a new supranational democracy.This view is shared by the head of the Danish central bank, who told the Danish Parliament: ""I think that what we are seeing at the European level is the bureaucratisation of economic policy"".The Swedish trade unions are in line with the European Trade Union Confederation which has, for the first time ever, opposed a treaty.  Of course, this is not an EU treaty but a number of member states have signed up to it, if not yet ratified it.  Does this not say everything?  The European Trade Union Confederation whose members passionately believe in a social Europe now sees that the dream could be lost if this direction is taken.  The confederation says:The new Treaty is only stipulating more of the same: austerity and budgetary discipline.  It will force member states to pursue damaging pro-cyclical fiscal policies, giving absolute priority to rigid economic rules at a time when mosteconomies are still weak and unemployment intolerably high.  It will bring downwards pressure on wages and working conditions.The Portuguese campaign for an audit of their national debt, representing a broad swathe of Portuguese civil society, is similarly opposed to the treaty.  I quote the campaign:Sooner or later, this treaty will be revoked because countries will be unable to comply with its conditions.  Until then, it will make austerity harder and more aggressive.  It is not a treaty on stability, co-ordination or governance but a treaty on austerity, inequality and destruction.Heikki Patomaki, Professor of World Politics at the University of Helsinki, Finland, slates the treaty's anti-democratic nature.  I quote him:The exceptional provisions allowed for under the terms of the fiscal compact are hostile to the basic principles of democracy, as is the fact that the compact gives rise to legal norms which override EU member states' own constitutions, and which cannot be changed by democratic means.  In a democracy no rule or principle can ever be set in stone, but must always be adapted to the possibilities and constraints at hand.  From this perspective, Merkel's idea of unending budgetary discipline is anti-democratic.Yiorgos Vassalos, of the highly respected Corporate Europe Observatory organisation, a long time monitor of how big business influences the EU policy agenda, notes that:The fiscal treaty mirrors the proposals of big business lobby groups to strengthen the Commission's capacity to determine the economic policies of EU member states.  The fiscal compact would transfer excessive new powers to the European Commission, an unelected body with strong links to corporate lobbies.National parliaments would lose control, while no democratic control mechanism is foreseen at the EU level.  Thus the fiscal compact spells out an authoritarian form of economic governance at EU level.A wide swathe of opinion is opposed to the treaty.  I could talk about the Dutch labour party and German social democrats.  There is widespread concern across Europe at the implications of this treaty.Our people should have the freedom and capacity to look at this treaty on its merits or demerits and make their decision.  I appeal to the Government to cut out the nonsense about conditionality of access to European Stability Mechanism funding, the blackmail clause.  The Government has not ratified the European Stability Mechanism.  It holds a veto in terms of the amendment to Article 136.  Sinn Féin brought forward a Private Members' motion asking the Government not to introduce the ESM legislation until the people had their say on the austerity treaty.  I commend the Government on having done that.The Government must now allow the people decide on the capacity of the treaty for stability, as the Government claims, or austerity, as we argue, and make up their own minds without this threat.  The Government can undertake not to implement the ESM treaty and the conditionality that comes with it if the people reject this treaty.  It should defend the Irish people's interest and state that this is wrong.Ministers and Deputies from the Government parties have said the austerity treaty is not a big deal and that we already have its measures in the six pack.  If we are meeting the commitments of the six pack, are the poster boys for austerity and are complying with the requirements of the troika, who are in Ireland at present to make another tick on our scorecard, how can we be refused access to ESM funding?  This is an empty threat, but a threat nonetheless.  I appeal to the Government to remove that threat, which it has the power to do, and give the people capacity to make up their own minds.  The Government cannot say to the Irish people that they will be isolated within Europe if they reject the proposition when I have just read out the range of public opinion across almost every member state that is stacked against the treaty.People are disgusted and disillusioned.  They believe the political institutions of Europe have failed them and have moved away from the promise of a social Europe and the positive achievements of the European Union towards a big business dominated agenda.  Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, Mario Monti, the technocratic Prime Minister of Italy and Lucas Papademos, the technocratic Prime Minister of Greece all come from the Goldman Sachs stable.  This is insanity.  Our people see those at the higher echelons who caused this crisis being rewarded.  There are those in the trade union movement across Europe who refer to this treaty as proof of a right wing coup.  Is that what we want?  Do we want more Thatcherism or more equality?  Do we want more of the promise of social Europe?  That is our challenge.Our people should not have this threat hung over them with the compliance and assistance of our Government.  If that threat is removed we can have a proper debate with space for the Irish people to have their say."	spk_388

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-03-22	dail	31	European Stability Mechanism: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_5	"I always enjoy listening to speeches of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  I read his article in the On the specifics, let us be clear that there is no solution to Ireland's economic crisis or Europe's economic crisis in the austerity treaty.  This treaty is about the need for the German Chancellor, Dr. Angela Merkel, to be re-elected.  It is about the need for Dr. Merkel to put out a narrative that what caused the economic crisis we face in Europe was fiscal indiscipline.As Deputy Brian Hayes spoke of Maastricht and how he voted for it, let us look at the record here in Ireland.  For most of the 11 or 12 years since the State has been a member of the eurozone, it was below the 3% deficit ceiling and within the debt-to-GDP ratio target of 60%.  Ireland met those targets for most of those years.  We stopped reaching those targets when we were saddled with the horrendous banking debt at the insistence of the European Central Bank, at the folly of the Government and in the betrayal of the people.  The economic crisis in Ireland was caused not by the failure to meet some set of arbitrary targets but by the fact that the people were saddled with profound banking debt.There are three core elements to the crisis in Europe: the banking crisis; the sovereign debt crisis; and the investment and unemployment crisis.  The Government does not have a solution to those three issues.  It does not have a real and radical reform of the financial and banking sector.  What we see are those within an ideology - I accept Deputy Brian Hayes shares this as he is right-wing and a Thatcherite politician - such as the technocratic Prime Minister of Italy, Mr. Mario Monti, the technocratic Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Papademos, and the man in charge of the European Central Bank, whose common denominator is that they come from the Goldman Sachs philosophy.  When the Greek Prime Minister dared to suggest a referendum, he was quickly shunted aside and replaced by a technocratic Prime Minister from the exact same ideology of unfettered, unbridled right-wing capitalism that has failed, not only Europe but the United States and much of the global economy at this time.As to whether there is a redirection of Deputy Brian Hayes's ideology and whether there is any humility that he might have been wrong in following that ideology all of those years, seeking to bring down public services and workers' terms and pay, to privatise public services, to provide for light-touch regulation and deregulation, and to let the markets grow with trickle-down benefit for all of the people on the ground, there is none whatsoever.  It is more of the same.  That is what this austerity treaty is about and that is why Sinn Féin opposes it.We are not alone.  The European Trade Union Confederation has given a damning analysis of this treaty.  The expected next President of France, M. Hollande, stated he will seek to renegotiate this.  The Dutch Labour Party states it will look to oppose this if it cannot get guarantees around deficits that are unreasonable.  The Minister of State's colleagues in the right-wing Government in Spain are seeking renegotiation.  These arbitrary targets are not going to solve our economic crisis and that is the basis on which we oppose it.I listened with great interest to the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and his colleagues in Government express their serious concern that the backstop, to quote the Minister of State's terminology, of the European stability mechanism would be lost to the Irish people if we were to reject this treaty or if we dared just to take this treaty on its merits or demerits.  If the Government is so concerned about it, and if it is serious and real, it has the capacity to stop it happening.  We know it conceded it in the negotiations but it now has the opportunity to stop this happening because it can veto it.  The amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is something the Government has the capacity to veto - that is a reality.  It can stop this happening.  It can refuse to bring this legislation before the House and give the Irish people their right to look at this treaty without the threat of access to future funding - it can do all of that if it chooses.  Otherwise, will it actively collude in this blackmail and threat?  It can give us no other description than that.When I check my dictionary and read the objective of that clause put into the preamble, I can only come to this conclusion.  Let us be very clear, in case the Government tries to muddy the waters.  We are challenging the Government to put its money where its mouth is.  If it is concerned about this issue and attempts to use it during the campaign, we will remind the Government, if it votes against this motion, that this was its choice.  It colluded in it and is part of that agenda.Let us look at the whole issue of alternatives and what Sinn Féin has said in regard to the banking crisis.  Most reasonable economists would agree it is long overdue that we had rigorous stress testing of the European core banks, the large banks that were responsible for the recklessness and lending that took place in the periphery, to private banks in the Irish case.  We need the full facts to be on the table regarding all of these derivatives, securitisation agendas and credit default swaps.  Everything they were involved in needs to be on the table and a cleansing of the banking system needs to take place.  When that takes place, on a case-by-case basis, we should have de-leveraging and then recapitalisation on a sensible, prudent, case-by-case basis.  Of course, that has not happened at all.We then need to look at the issue of sovereign debt.  The Minister of State tells us we might be able to transfer this promissory note for a bond and kick the can down the road.  However, there is no writedown of our debt, this unjust burden that was put on our people.  We were saddled with the full impact of this crisis.  It is remarkable that we have no deal for our people.  How can we sustain growth?  How can we really have a plan if we do not get a fair deal - a writedown - in the short, medium and long term for the interests of our people?Next is the issue of investment and unemployment.  It is not just Ireland that is impacted in this way.  Spain has half of its young people out of work.  Unemployment is rife, particularly across what are known as the peripheral states.  Austerity has been an absolute failure.  Those on what would be called the progressive left, with all its different elements in the social democratic movements and trade union movements, are stinging in their criticism of this agenda, this right wing coup that has taken place, and which I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, supports because it is part of his ideology.  It is a grave injustice to our people.What could be done?  There is the National Pensions Reserve Fund of €5.3 billion.  We could ally those resources with the potential of the European Investment Bank, which has a track record of prudence and investment with return.  We could look at next generation broadband, on which there was a presentation in this House.  Imagine what it would do for Ireland's economy if we could roll out next generation broadband, which is doable.  We could have a real plan supporting our small businesses and linking them to export opportunities.  We could give entrepreneurism hope.  We could give hope to the people who are queuing up for the overseas jobs expo.No hope can be given to our people in this way.  We must fit in to this crazy, right wing coup that is taking place in Europe.  This is strange to me when one considers that what has caused this crisis is a fundamental failure of that ideology.  Deregulation left the financiers free to do their job, and look at the disaster it has brought upon our people.  These are the reasons we have opposed this treaty and these are the solutions we offer up.What I find interesting is the speaking out of the side of the mouth-type language that we would need a backstop and that we could not access support if we reject this treaty.  As Deputy Shane Ross said, we have the most compliant Taoiseach.  This is the most complaint Government in all of Europe in regard to these issues.  The reality is that our people, at the insistence of the European Central Bank and due to the past and ongoing folly of our politicians, have been left to carry the can for a fundamental failure that was not Irish in its genesis but European and global.  We have met all the targets we have been asked to meet.  We have delivered punishing austerity on our people.  We have met every troika demand, and every quarter it comes here to tell us so.  How can the Minister of State possibly suggest that, having been the most compliant Government and people in Europe, we would be refused access if we needed it again?  It is patent nonsense.What Sinn Féin is asking the Government to do is to remove the scare tactics from this debate, to take away the threats from a people who are weary, a people who have had to carry the burden for what was a European financial crisis, which was fundamentally a failure of the European banking system and of global capitalism.  Our people have carried that burden for too long.  What we want is a plan and a strategy for growth and jobs that is real, just and fair.The Minister of State talks about extraneous issues.  This is the extraneous issue of this campaign, namely, the threat that we could not access support if we reject this treaty.  I ask the Minister of State and the Government to do the right thing.  If it is sincere in its concern, then our motion is reasonable.  The Government should not put through this legislation.  It should give the Irish people their say and give them clear space to look at this treaty and decide whether we can really meet these targets and move with more austerity.  That is the question we put.  The Minister of State should not muddy the waters or have any doubt about our approach in this regard.I understand, Minister of State, that you are a right wing politician, a Thatcherite politician.  You are into ""reds under the bed""-type articles in newspapers.  That has been your track record and long may it continue because it inspires us to work even harder for our communities."	spk_266

How can the Labour Party in Ireland, enthusiastic members of the European family, ignore its own brothers and sisters on the left within that European family?

Will the Government now refuse to take that through, follow through the concern it has expressed and block it going through these Houses?	spk_147

The report published on 24 February makes for very sobering reading.  The conclusion stated that budget 2012 involved greater proportionate losses for those on low incomes, reductions of about 2% to 2.5% for those on the lowest incomes as against losses of about 0.75% for those on the highest incomes.  Indeed, the report compared the impact of the budget on low income households with that of the previous Government's from 2008 and also concluded that the budget was more regressive.Given the fact that this budget will have a disproportionate impact on lower income groups, in particular the additional charges and taxes, including the VAT increase, the purpose of this amendment is to provide for a detailed impact assessment of these measures on all income groups so that we get a full picture of the extent to which the Minister is seeking to punish low and middle income groups while regarding the better off in society."	spk_481

When the Minister announced the removal of 300,000 low-paid workers from the USC net last December, Sinn Féin welcomed the move but called on the Minister to go further and to remove the 500,000 workers earning the minimum wage or less from this regressive tax.  The arguments for doing so are compelling, the first of which is that it is the right thing to do.  Equally importantly, it will benefit the economy overall because it will provide a significant boost to consumer spending.  There are plenty of better ways to raise the same amount of revenue, such as raising the marginal rate of tax to 40% for very high earners.  Doing so would have less of a negative impact on the economy than leaving up to 200,000 low-paid workers in the USC tax net."	spk_491

Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 seek to ensure this is the effect of the tax reliefs.  Previous Governments were very fond of introducing tax reliefs to enrich small groups of people, while claiming that they would be good for the economy as a whole.  As a result, the Exchequer lost billions in revenue foregone every year with little, if any, social or economic gain to the State.While we are not suggesting that this is the Minister's intention with respect to this section of the Bill, it is only right that those seeking to avail of this relief should do more to demonstrate they are deserving of the substantial tax windfalls they will secure.  Failure to do this will lead many people to conclude that the Government is simply following in the same footsteps of its predecessors by placing the majority of the tax burden on low and middle income earners while reducing the tax burden on those already very well rewarded for their employment."	spk_498

This Bill reflects its insistence on austerity without a real strategy for jobs and growth.  How can we achieve growth when we are taking billions of euro from the real economy every year?  The Minister is as wise as anybody in this House and I am sure he is hearing the same complaints as the rest of us from his constituents, small businesses and people with vision and energy who want to create jobs.  At some point there will have to be space and air for our people to breathe.The Government is at present negotiating with the ECB on the €3.1 billion due on the promissory notes at the end of the month.  That is €668 for every man, woman and child in this State every year until 2023.  How can we successfully implement any strategy in that framework?  If the Minister were having a private pint with somebody I believe he would admit the answer is beyond him.Our country is struggling.  The people with vision and energy, our entrepreneurs and small business and those who desperately want to return to the labour market are being failed by the framework the Government is implementing.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-03-07	dail	31	European Council: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_8	"I wish to deal first with the comments of Deputy Micheál Martin, who referred to Sinn Féin's position on the treaty campaign as cynical.  To be honest I find it amusing because I remember the then Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Mr. Dick Roche, Deputy Martin's Cabinet colleague, say there would not be a second vote on the Lisbon treaty.  He assured people they would have only one bite of the cherry and that there would not be a second vote.  He then went on to lead us into a second campaign when the Government did not get the answer it wanted the first time.  That is very cynical.  In the second campaign the economic crisis had just begun to emerge and people were deeply alarmed and fearful for their future.  The campaign slogan was ""Yes for jobs, yes for growth, yes for prosperity"".  We now know what all of those assurances got us.  I call that deeply cynical.  We in Sinn Féin are not going to take lectures from Deputy Micheál Martin about cynicism because the evidence is that as the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and a senior member of Fianna Fáil he played a significant role in those two campaigns.  He should not use such words as ""cynical"" because we can get copies of his quotes and statements if he wants.  It would be advisable for Deputy Martin to move away from name-calling.The Government never dreamt it would be in this position.  It sought to avoid a referendum by all means.  In the negotiations the two things that were achieved - or conceded - by our negotiators were, first, the insertion of the words ""preferably constitutional"", which was obviously aimed at avoiding a referendum, and acknowledged as such by the Tánaiste.  Second, we had the insistence of Mrs. Angela Merkel's government that a stick would be introduced to beat our people with on conditionality such that we could not access the European stability mechanism funding unless we agreed to the treaty.  That is what the Government achieved in order to try to avoid putting the proposition to the people and to give Mrs. Angela Merkel's government a stick to beat us with if we did find ourselves in that position.  That is some achievement.  It is a remarkable betrayal of the people by the Government in those negotiations.Unfortunately for the Government the first part has not worked, as after much deliberation the Attorney General has reported back that the Government has no choice but to put the treaty before the people.  Sinn Féin received considerable legal advice and we would have taken the Government to court if necessary.  We believe we would have achieved the same outcome.  The Government has done what it did not want to do and now we are in the middle of a campaign.In considering the conclusions of the European Council I am conscious that I am speaking as the Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party is present in the Chamber.  The conclusions are all about right wing politics.  Mr. Fintan O'Toole is considered to be a left wing commentator, someone the Labour grassroots would read assiduously every week to get their direction on the way the country is going.  He reported that the treaty outlaws Keynesianism.  It enshrines right wing ideology and a right wing view of how we should run our affairs across Europe.  The more one looks at it the more shocking it is that any member of the Labour Party in this country, or anyone who is part of the left historically in Europe, could agree to it.Point No. 9 of the conclusions refers to shifting taxes away from labour.  That sounds good; that it will take the weight off working people but one must ask whether we are going to have wealth taxes.  Are we going to ask those at the higher level to pay their fair share?  It does not; what it means is that we are going to cut public services and the welfare state across Europe.  Why does it not say that when that is what it means?  There is a right wing intent.  The conclusions also refer to increased efforts to make it easier and more attractive for employers to hire people where necessary by improving wage-setting mechanisms.  That reads well but one can translate it to mean reduced wages and making it easier to sack people.  An unravelling of the social Europe is taking place as we speak by the very people who caused the crisis - the right wing ideologues.  Point No. 15 refers to a reduction in the administration and regulatory burdens at EU and national level and the removal of barriers to the creation of new jobs.  That translates to a recipe for light-touch regulation, which is more right wing ideology.I can understand Fine Gael, whose history is as an avowedly right wing party, supporting the conclusions but for the life of me I cannot understand how the Labour Party could sign up to this power grab by the right in Europe.  If the Tánaiste is not happy with my assessment of matters he should look at the comments of his MEPs.  We are being told the treaty will formalise the six pack and various other measures to which we have agreed and that this is a good way to run our affairs.  However, this is not what Labour Party MEPs are saying and we will be quoting their comments to the public during the course of the referendum campaign.  We will also be quoting them and the damning analysis of the treaty by Mr. Jack O'Connor, a Labour Party member and senior trade unionist, to the Labour Party grassroots.  At some point the Labour Party will have to question its reason for supporting the approach being taken to tackling the crisis.  I do not think it believes in that approach;  I hope it does not.  What we are witnessing is a right-wing revolution which outlaws Keynesian economics, the potential of a government to stimulate an economy, to intervene in a recession or counter the cycle, which has always been the position of the left.  This has been our approach to addressing crises since the Second World War.  Mr. Fintan O'Toole summarised this best yesterday and it must have been painful for Labour Party members to read his analysis.  The Labour Party will have to endure a lot more pain during this campaign because we will be reminding the grassroots, its members and the people what it stated previously in comparison with its enthusiastic support for the treaty."	spk_277

They are protesting against what this treaty represents and against the right wing policies of austerity which have failed people across Europe.  That should inform the Tánaiste as to the approach he should have taken on this issue and as to the negotiation strategy he should have adopted.It is interesting that when people question the direction Europe is taking, we hear all sorts of statements about them being self-serving, cynical, conspiracy theorists, etc.  Yet, when the European Constitution was put to the people of France, debates took throughout that country, in libraries, town halls and hotels and, on a progressive basis, the French people rejected the proposition of the European Constitution.  They rejected the direction Europe was taking.  The people of Holland did the same.Before it came to Ireland, those in Europe stopped the process because the constitution was clearly being rejected.  What happened instead?  Did they go back to the drawing board saying they needed to reflect on the fact the European project was losing its way and was disconnected from the people on the ground?  Not at all.  They reconfigured some small parts of the constitution and put together the Lisbon treaty.  The only reason Ireland had its say on the Lisbon treaty was thanks to Raymond Crotty, who took his case in the 1980s and against all the odds eventually won the right for the Irish people to have their say on these matters, the transfer of economic and political sovereignty to another remit.  The Irish people then became the third country to reject what was, essentially, the same proposition.What did Europe do about this?  We know what the Tánaiste did about it.

This treaty is about Angela Merkel's insistence on austerity.

This is a lie.  The core responsibility, particularly of German banks, is evident.  I could quote George Soros, the former German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Joschka Fischer, and former British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, on this.  This is the reality, yet Germany has not shouldered its responsibility when communicating to its people.  However, we buy into this narrative.

There is the investment crisis, the unemployment crisis, the sovereign debt crisis and a banking crisis.  On the issue of investment and unemployment, we have a huge resource in Europe, the European Investment Bank, which could be deployed in a strategic fashion to get the stimulus started across Europe.  It has a track record of prudent investment and return and provides an intelligent way of redistributing wealth throughout the European area, but in a way that provides a return on the investment.	spk_319

The emphasis is on always complying with the numbers.On sovereign debt, we all know there must be a realistic write-down of debt.  That is what the markets will respond to.  They know that we cannot sustain our levels of debt.  We cannot have growth in these countries and in the wider eurozone unless we have a realistic and fair deal for our people.  We must also look at the European Central Bank and redeploy its resources and give it the capacity to purchase government bonds in the primary markets.  The banking issue is a core issue.

They have not been rigorously stress tested.  All of the books across Europe - not just in Ireland - should be opened.  The truth should be put on the table.  When the rigorous stress tests reveal all the facts about the reality of the extent of this crisis, the banks can deleverage and we can recapitalise them on a case by case basis.  Why has that not happened already?  Why has the need for truth not been dealt with?  I suggest that the core states want to ignore the truth.  It is easy to sell a narrative about Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Italy being feckless and to suggest that people in the south of Europe and on the periphery of Europe do not have the same sense of discipline, responsibility and organisation as people in the core states.	spk_323

Keynes believed in interventionism and that the role of the state was to intervene during recessions.

Unbridled, fierce capitalism has left a devastated mess behind.What do we get in response to the failure of that right-wing Thatcherite ideology?  More of the same.  We have an austerity treaty which aims at cutting public services and we are getting rid of our State assets in a panicked fire sale at the worst possible moment in order to meet the demands of those who have failed us.This betrayal of the promises made to the people over the years affects our health system as well as State assets.  HIQA is trying to do its important job at a time when health services are suffering from a lack of investment in health services.  This under-investment in community hospitals and long-stay homes plays into the hands of the private sector.  Private nursing homes are stepping in to do the job that the State used to do while also driving down wages and conditions because nurses are paid a lot less in the private sector.  Our hospitals' car parks, shops and cafés are being privatised.  Resources are being removed from local authorities and handed over to the private sector.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-02-07	dail	31	International Co-operation: Motion	dbsect_35	"It is only fair to begin by reiterating what Sinn Féin Members have stated previously in this House regarding the proud record of peacekeeping enjoyed by the Defence Forces.  As with all deployments of personnel overseas, the triple lock mechanism applies.  The last deployment subject to the triple lock mechanism was for a peacekeeping mission to the Lebanon and that deployment was supported by all parties in this House.  I make this point lest anyone think there are Members who are opposed to overseas deployments in all circumstances, as this clearly is not the case.  However, Sinn Féin has grave concerns regarding the possible deployment of Defence Forces personnel under the battle group arrangements.  Sinn Féin considers battle groups to be more about military powers in Europe wishing to push Europe in a certain direction militarily than about any sense of responsibility to peacekeeping.The term, ""battle group"" must be addressed.  The terminology is important and the Minister already has recognised this fact during the select committee discussion on the motion.  I have no doubt that some of our so-called partners in this battle group, such as Germany, for example, and others within the wider European Union seek the formation of a European army.  Angela Merkel has repeatedly stated her desire to see the establishment of a European Union-wide army.  This is the reason, when I hear terminology such as ""battle groups"", I suspect it may be perceived by those who favour the creation of a European Union-wide army to be a first step towards this goal.Sinn Féin's other major objection pertains to the cost associated with these battle groups.  The stand-by cost of €380,000 may not appear excessive in the context of the overall defence budget.  However, it comprises a significant amount at a time when the State is closing Army barracks, reducing personnel numbers and when the financial cost of serving in the Defence Forces is rising due to rising transport costs associated with barracks closures.  This is not to mention the additional cost of €10.7 million that would be incurred were we ever obliged to deploy personnel.  While I acknowledge Ireland would be able to recoup most of these costs from the European Union, even were it obliged to bear one fifth of the cost, that would mean finding approximately €2 million from the defence budget.  Ireland simply could not afford to deploy troops, which begs the question as to the reason we are so fixated on being part of the battle groups.  While Sinn Féin would oppose this motion for financial reasons alone, far more importantly we will oppose it because we consider it to threaten the neutrality the State has maintained proudly since its foundation."	spk_449

Now that I have the Minister's attention, I tell her that there were 8,000 people on the live register in Donegal, but today there are around 23,000 people on the register.  Emigration is a big issue in our county.  Thousands of our young people across the county have emigrated.  When unemployment has trebled in a county that has historically suffered from disadvantage, then how in the name of God can the Minister possibly justify cutting community employment schemes?  She should double or treble the contribution towards these projects.  These projects are on the front line and they deal with the devastation that has been caused.The reason I wanted the Minister's attention is that she was such a passionate opponent of what the last Government did.  I remember her being so prominent on the television.  I used to watch her at home on news reports as one of the leading voices against the impact of what has happened.  How can she possibly stand over cutting the funds to community employment in a county like Donegal, not to mind the other disadvantaged areas of the State?  How can she possibly stand over cutting projects that provide support to young people, the elderly, crèches, community resource centres and tidy towns committees?  This is the thread that holds our communities together.  At a time when we face such economic hardship, some of the few good news stories come from such people in those centres.  They are the ""can do"" people who are rolling up their sleeves and meeting the demands the Government makes of them in respect of local leadership and positivity.  The very people who are providing that leadership in local communities are seeing these cuts.I am happy to provide the Minister with the details of the meeting after my contribution.  I will send her an e-mail about it.    I ask the Minister to become again the woman, the leader she was before she assumed her position last February.  I ask her to look into her heart, to remember what she has stood for all her life.  I reiterate what I have said before that I do not presume to be a better person than the Minister nor do I consider myself to be a more decent person than her.  I do not believe that I care more about these issues than the Minister does.  However, she needs to prove me right.  She needs to put it into action.  She knows the impact of this crisis on communities which have been historically disadvantaged and which suffer from unemployment and all the resultant challenges.  I ask her not to take from those at the front line; please do not undermine the morale and spirit of those local leaders whom we need to help get this country back on top again.  That is my appeal to the Minister and I thank her for giving me her attention."	spk_535

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-02-01	dail	31	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_4	"The Taoiseach and leaders from 24 other European Union member states agreed to a new austerity treaty which will mean imposing savage austerity on the citizens of this State and citizens across Europe for years to come.  It is not a real surprise that the Taoiseach supported this treaty as he has long signalled support for the austerity approach despite its devastating social consequences.In recent days, the Taoiseach stated he had ""no fear or concern or anxiety"" about the prospect of a referendum on the treaty.  The major focus of the Government's negotiation strategy throughout this entire process has been to avoid the necessity to hold a referendum.  If he has nothing to fear from this process and is so confident about the austerity treaty, why does he not stop hiding behind the Attorney General and put the text to the people?  The Government should hold a referendum on the eurozone austerity treaty irrespective of the legal advice given by the Attorney General.Sinn Féin believes the treaty, if ratified, will have a profound impact on the Irish economy and people for decades to come.  Recent opinion polls confirm that the overwhelming majority of the electorate supports our view.  A massive 72% believe a referendum is necessary.  It is clear, therefore, that people want to have their say on this matter.  The Government does not have a mandate to sign up to a treaty which will have such serious implications for the future.  It must do the right thing and hold a referendum.Sinn Féin has argued that austerity is not the answer to this crisis but part of the problem.  What is needed is a strategy for jobs and growth through stimulus.  While European Union leaders seem to have finally woken up to this reality and discussed these issues at their summit, not one additional cent has been allocated to job creation.  Rather than announcing new plans or providing new money for job creation, all that emerged from the meeting was a rehash of existing plans and money.The so-called debt brake of 0.5% of GDP will heap yet more austerity on people in Ireland.  It will result in the hand-over of significant control of fiscal and budgetary matters to unelected and unaccountable EU officials.  The austerity treaty is bad for Ireland and Europe.  Rather than stabilising the euro, it will make matters worse.  In seeking to impose drastic and destructive austerity policies into perpetuity the Government is signing all of us up to budgets that involve savage cuts for its full term of office and beyond.What is completely absent from the treaty are any moves towards debt restructuring.  Last week, the Taoiseach told the world that the people of Ireland went mad borrowing and this led to the economic crisis.  The reality was that Irish banks went mad borrowing cheap money from European banks.  They did so to make a profit and because they were greedy.  Their actions drove house prices ever higher, forcing citizens to borrow large amounts of money simply to buy a place to live.  These self-same banks are now being bailed out by the taxpayer at a colossal cost of €63 billion.Last week in the Dáil, the Taoiseach stated he did not want to have the word ""defaulter"" written ""on our foreheads"" and he had not sought a debt write-down.  The point is that the banking debt is not the people's debt and should not be paid.  Did the Taoiseach raise this issue at the European Council meeting?"	spk_205

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-02-01	dail	31	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_4	"The European Union institutions, supported by the International Monetary Fund, have responded to the crisis by imposing heavy austerity on the populations of peripheral economies, while forcing their governments to take on massive loans to bail out toxic banks. This response is having devastating social consequences, not only in Ireland but across the European Union.  Despite an endless round of crisis summits, a massive transfer of moneys from taxpayers to banks and the austerity treaty, the response to the crisis is not working.  Youth unemployment is at crisis level, with nearly one third of young people in Ireland and almost half of Spanish young people out of work.  Thousands of young people have to leave the State every week to try to make a living elsewhere.  What does the future hold for them?  Where is the hope for them?  As a man from the west, the Taoiseach is aware of the impact of emigration and the shadow it casts on the small, rural communities dotted across the west.  He knows about the empty seats at dinner tables during the Christmas period just passed and the tears shed at airports.  We do not want to hear Ministers describe emigration as a lifestyle choice again.Sinn Féin believes Ireland's place is in Europe.  Co-operation with our European partners is essential if we are to meet the challenges facing us in the time ahead.  In attempting to portray the choice before Irish people as one of accepting the austerity treaty or leaving the euro the Government is simply scaremongering.  The scenario it presents is incorrect because Ireland's position as a member of the eurozone is secure irrespective of what position we take on the treaty.  The real question facing the Dáil and citizens is whether this treaty is a good deal for Ireland and Europe.  Sinn Féin firmly believes the answer to that question is a negative.In regard to Article 3.2, as the Taoiseach knows, the language in the first draft was very clear at the insistence of Angela Merkel's Government that we shall transpose these agreements into the constitution or equivalent legislation.  The first draft was very clear about what Chancellor Merkel's Government wanted.  The Taoiseach's colleague, the Tánaiste, speaking at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs, confirmed - the Taoiseach refused to do so today, so I will clarify the matter for him - that our negotiators, clearly at the instruction of either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste, presumably both, actively sought to weaken that text and to put in the words ""preferably constitutional"" in order to avoid the requirement to put this proposition before the people.  However, the words ""binding"" and ""permanent"" are still there.  All of the draconian austerity measures, which will go beyond this troika package, are still there, as are all the implications.  The only change which the Taoiseach secured was to prevent the people having their say on this issue.  That is outrageous and shameful.Then we had the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, tell us that in these debates, people tend to focus on all sorts of things.  They might focus on septic tanks, bank bailouts and other such issues.  This is an 11 page document.  Even if some of his points were accepted, it is not the Lisbon treaty or the Nice treaty.  The issues are clear, they can be argued clearly and can be accessible to our people.  There is no justification for not putting this before the people because the implications are so profound.  That is what the Taoiseach achieved in the negotiations.  The only thing he achieved in terms of Chancellor Merkel's crazy austerity-driven approach is to prevent the people having their say.Austerity has not worked.  If the Taoiseach does not want to take Sinn Féin's word for it, I am sure he will take the word of the IMF.  The IMF recently published a report which looked at austerity over the past 30 years and 173 different case studies.  All that austerity has done, in the absence of some growth strategy, is drive up unemployment and make conditions extremely harsh.  This is a mad strategy and I have yet to hear one economist say it can possibly work or, as the Taoiseach said was his objective, get Ireland back to work, or make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business.  How in the name of God will he achieve that by signing up to this document without any plan for growth, without any sense of investment and without any real economic approach or outline plan?If the Taoiseach is not happy with the IMF, I will give him some more examples.  Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize winning economist and the person the Taoiseach called a ""commentator"" - commentators comment when the Taoiseach is over in Davos where he said the people went mad borrowing - travels the world-----"	spk_209

Some eminent people who he respects - whatever he thinks about Sinn Féin's perspective - are telling him that this whole approach is crazy.The European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion said that by purely cutting wages, competitiveness does not improve.  He also said that we must also invest in the labour force and that a more balanced approach, more solitary and cohesion among member states is needed because to end the crisis, Europe cannot rely solely on austerity measures.

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-02-01	dail	31	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_4	"-----tomfoolery with President Sarkozy.We have identified four elements to the crisis, with which I think the Taoiseach will agree.  There are the issues of the crisis of investment and the crisis of the role of European Central Bank.  How can the European Central Bank play a more constructive role in solving this crisis?  There are also the issues of debt restructuring and of the management of this crisis and the banking crisis throughout Europe.Let us deal with the first one because the Taoiseach asked for solutions and constructive debate.  Let me give him Sinn Féin's constructive contribution in case he did not have the opportunity to read what I gave him.  In terms of the investment crisis, we have a National Pensions Reserve Fund with €5.3 billion.  When the Sinn Féin leader, Deputy Gerry Adams, the deputy leader, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I met the troika, we probed this issue of utilising the European Investment Bank's immense resources.  The bank has a strong track record in terms of investment and return, so it is a fairly prudent and strategic way to invest money.  We should combine the resources of the European Investment Bank with our National Pensions Reserve Fund and utilise that to invest in various projects, for example, the roll-out of next generation broadband.  Recently, Deputies and Senators from all parties watched a presentation on the potential this would unleash in this country.  I could go on but that is just one element.  We need to unleash the potential of the European Investment Bank in a serious way.The little document which was used as window dressing to the austerity treaty has no new money or no new plans.  It is a reconfiguration of existing ideas.  We need a dramatic intervention and a real message of hope, jobs and growth to be sent to people throughout Europe, in particular, in the interest of the Taoiseach, to people in Ireland.  That is the first element in terms of investment.The second element is the banking system.  Let us have a bit of honesty about this.  There must be rigorous stress testing of the core European banks because we have not had it to date.  We know they behaved recklessly and were utilised strategically to take that trade surplus and wealth in Germany and other states to invest it in the periphery, whether a bad investment in the Greek Government or an appallingly bad investment in the private Irish banks.  We know they have caused this crisis and that it was not caused by the people going mad borrowing.  We know there was a fundamental lack of regulation in the international financial system which was not just limited to Europe.  We know it happened in the US also.  When will we have rigorous stress testing of those banks and then some deleveraging?  We can then recapitalise when we know where we stand.  We have had some tinkering around the edges.  This is the core issue that Sinn Féin believes these states are afraid of.  When we go to that issue, we get to the root of the problem.  However, there is no Government solution to address it, other than to say that we must have more austerity.The third element, after investment and banking, is sovereign debt.  We must have a real discussion about how Ireland, Greece and other countries will sustain this debt.  Where is the burden sharing?  Where is the pain being felt by the banking system for the calamitous approach it took to global finances?  There has to be a real debate about that.We in Ireland cannot be condemned to these annual €3.1 billion promissory notes, nor can we be condemned to continue with these cuts and all the lobbies we have to face.  I am sure if we had more Fine Gael and Labour Deputies here for this debate they would testify that their clinics are packed and their diaries are full of meetings with representations from schools, hospitals and other sectors that say they cannot sustain the cutbacks.  There must be hope for a way out of this situation.When the Taoiseach was first elected to the Dáil all those decades ago, I do not think he ever imagined that he would be presiding over such a scenario.  At some point, he will have to give our people hope.  He will have to go out there and find that Irish spirit, which has been there for generations, to do something about this.  He will have to go in and say, ""Folks, enough of the niceties and frivolities - the 500-lb gorilla in the room is this crisis which is not being addressed properly"".  He will have to tell Chancellor Angela Merkel that we do not have a crisis because the Irish people went mad borrowing and spending but because political leaders, the global banking system, estate agents and economists, who were paid by the financial institutions, utterly failed our people.When the regular Joe Soaps and five eighths turned on their televisions at home every single night, an economist was telling them they had to buy now because house prices were going to rise further.  Then they said there would be a soft landing.  When they opened their newspapers, there were property supplements about lifestyles and how many houses were for sale.  Our people are not Harvard, Yale or Trinity-educated economists; they are just hard-working, decent people but they were profoundly failed by their political leaders.  When will that conversation take place?  When will we say that those responsible for this will pay a price, like the former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland who was stripped of his knighthood?  When will there be a radical realignment of that system, instead of those responsible being rewarded in America as treasury secretaries, and in Europe being appointed as technocrat prime ministers or to the presidency of the ECB?  Those are the very people in Goldman Sachs who drove this crisis.  Mr. Peter Sutherland, a former European Commissioner and Irish Attorney General, is telling us that we should pay our way.  He is not representing the interests of the Irish people, however.  He is representing his pals in Goldman Sachs.  At what point will we confront those who colluded to do so much harm to the people of Ireland, Europe and globally?  The Taoiseach knows that Sinn Féin is right in this analysis.  Why do we give these people a place at the top table?We must allow the European Central Bank to access primary markets and purchase those government bonds.  There has to be a way of deploying the European Investment Bank, the ECB and our collective wisdom to address this crisis and give our people hope.  Sinn Féin does not want to see the destruction of the potential for a social Europe.  Ireland cannot achieve her potential on her own.  We must engage with the outside world in transacting business and building alliances.  We must stand together and challenge injustices, including human rights abuses.  We should be clear that there is a solution in working with our European partners, but at some stage we must collectively challenge those who caused this crisis.  The Taoiseach can be sure that it is not the ordinary people of Mayo, Donegal or Dublin who did so."	spk_240

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-01-24	dail	31	European Council: Statements	dbsect_30	Sinn Féin has produced a document which it launched last week in Dublin.  It is an analysis of the crisis, to which we provide a number of solutions.  This so-called fiscal-austerity compact demonstrates that the leaders of Europe, including the Taoiseach, either do not know the causes of the problem or are in denial in this regard.  The Government needs to stand back and look at how we got here.  The crisis commenced with the formation of European Monetary Union and the eurozone when trade surpluses materialised in Germany resulting in the euro making the German economy even more competitive and in having a considerable bulk of the wealth at the core, followed by irresponsibility in distributing that wealth.  The blindness of the European Central Bank allowed core state banks to lend recklessly without regulation to the periphery, including private banks in Ireland and governments, without due recourse or due diligence in terms of what they were doing.  That is how the crisis was created.  There is a fundamental problem with European Monetary Union as configured.  A one-size-fits-all policy does not work for Europe.I have no doubt that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are aware that the saddling of the people with billions of euro of private sector debt is a gross injustice which undermines the principle of the European Union based on solidarity.  In the eyes of every fair international commentator and economist we have been disgracefully and abysmally treated.  The Government has a huge moral platform to defend the interests of the people.  They know this is wrong, as does the Taoiseach.Sinn Féin's document lists four main solutions to the main elements of the crisis, namely, investment, the banking system and the sovereign debt issue.  On investment, the potential of the European Investment Bank needs to be unleashed for a number of reasons, including that it has a solid track record of prudent investment and returns.  This would be a good way of sensibly lending from the wealth of the core states to the periphery.  This is a core issue.  To do this, we need to deploy resources to the European Investment Bank.  It is critical at this time that we send the message that there is a plan for job creation and growth in Europe.  The European Investment Bank has been completely under-deployed.  For example, we could use the National Pensions Reserve Fund in conjunction with the European Investment Bank to address core deficiencies in the State, not least the need for the roll-out of next generation broadband.  I could go on.The second element is the banking system.  There must be a cleansing of the European banking system.  There must be rigorous stress testing of the core banks, which we know has been avoided to date.  This must happen if we are to restore faith in the peoples of Europe and the markets about which we hear so much.  When this happens, deleveraging and recapitalisation will be required on a case by case basis.The third element is the sovereign debt issue, on which we must take a sensible approach.  Proper debt restructuring on a case by case basis will be required, in particular for Ireland.  Without this, there will not be growth in the economy.The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are west of Ireland men.  They know the impact of austerity on rural Ireland and are aware that the trail of emigration has recommenced.  They know that Sydney, Perth, Chicago, New York, London and Glasgow are filling up with another generation of Irish people.  We cannot sustain this.  We cannot continue to pay the private banking debt while crippling the hopes of the people.  Yesterday I visited the CoLab facility at Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  My spirit was lifted by the fantastic entrepreneurs in the building, people who have ideas around computerised gaming, media technology and medical devices.  They are brilliant people whose potential we need to unleash.  However, because of the manner in which we are going about addressing the crisis we cannot do this.  The Taoiseach knows that we cannot deploy austerity only and hope to return to growth.  As such, we need to do something about this issue.The final element relates to existing EU treaty provisions.  Sinn Féin believes that if there is the will, there is the scope to deploy the ECB to purchase Government bonds on the primary markets.  It has been doing this on the secondary markets but now needs to do it on the primary markets.  The specific article which Sinn Féin believes permits this is Article 282.2 which provides the capacity for this in the context of the collective interests of the peoples of Europe being demonstrated.  Could there be a more important time to do this?  The Government needs to deploy the ECB to purchase Government bonds on the primary markets, deploy the resources of the European Investment Bank, in conjunction with the resources of member states, including in Ireland of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, and deal with the issue of sovereign debt in a fair, sustainable and credible way.There is also the issue of the cleansing of the European banking system.  These are four concrete solutions and I will submit the document to the Government because sometimes the Taoiseach suggests Sinn Féin is reckless and so on.  This is an extremely responsible and sensible document that analyses clearly both the problems and what must be done.  The difficulty is that, for whatever reason, the focus is on austerity alone.  While that might be the view of Chancellor Angela Merkel, it is wrong.  It will not solve the crisis and the markets are not convinced.  Consequently, on behalf of my party, I appeal to the Government to consider its solutions which cover all aspects of the crisis and begin to defend Ireland's interests.  We are on a hiding to nothing and if we continue in this way, we will be facing a lost decade.	spk_323

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	39	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2012-01-11	dail	31	Special Educational Needs: Motion	dbsect_25	I had the privilege once of being a member of an audience listening to a speech by the former general secretary of the Labour Party, Mr. Mike Allen.  It was one of the best speeches I ever heard.  Mr. Allen talked about the impact of unemployment on working class and rural communities across the country following the 1980s and compared it to the potato famine, which devastated this country.  He said that it was not so much the famine that caused the devastation but the cholera, disease, hopelessness and loss of our language and that in the 1980s it was not so much the unemployment crisis but the heroin, despair, inter-generational unemployment and impact of it that caused the devastation.  He made that speech to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern.  One could have heard a pin drop.  It was a superb comparison.The Minister will be aware that much of the work being done by DEIS schools is addressing the legacy of the 1980s.  Almost half the number of people currently on the live register are long term unemployed.  In my constituency of Donegal north-east, emigration is rife again.  Thousands of young people across the county with a population of 160,000 people have emigrated.  Unemployment has increased from 8,000 to 23,000.  The impact of this on the ground is horrific.  The same is happening in our cities.  DEIS is dealing with the legacy of the last economic depression.  The current recession is taking from this and the previous generation, which is insanity.I do not perceive Ministers and Members opposite as indecent but the policies they are pursuing are fundamentally indecent.  How can they look the people of their communities in the eye, some of whom they went to school with, played football with or socialised with all of their lives and tell them this is right?  How can they tell the teachers who took up the challenge to reverse the impact on education of the last recession, that this is fair when in a few weeks time the Government will write a cheque for €1.2 million to people who I and they know should never see one cent of that money?  It will do the same in respect of a further €3.1 billion by the end of March.At what point will we look back to James Connolly?  At what point will we find the essential Irishness, the fighting spirit within ourselves, to stand up for the vulnerable young children and teachers at the front-line who have done Trojan work and reversed the tide of the 1980s?  These teachers who are now facing another tide need more, not less resources.  The challenge to the Members opposite is to do something about this profound injustice.At what stage will the Government raise with Chancellor Merkel, President Sarkozy or whomever are the Ministers for education in Germany and France how its Ministers are to justify these types of insidious, unjust, indecent cuts against the most disadvantaged people in this country while it pays wealthy, greedy, reckless, elite investors around the globe?  What I am witnessing is remarkable.  It is the hijacking of decency and democracy by an elite which gambled recklessly, lobbied for low regulation and took over the sanity of Governments and economists and destroyed our economies.  What have we done?  We have rewarded them and put them at the head of the European Central Bank, ECB, and made them technocratic Prime Ministers in Greece and Italy.At what point do we look at the busts around this Chamber and acknowledge our inheritance as Irish citizens?  The Proclamation at the front door which vows to cherish the children of the nation equally is my inheritance as a Teachta Dála.  At what point do we find within ourselves the ability to fight against this disastrous situation we face?  I am sure that in 20 years' time I will review more speeches by people like Mr. Mike Allen and others engaged in community activism.  We will review the speeches of another Mike Allen in regard to the impact of this recession and the need to address it, to which speech another Taoiseach will listen, comment that it was great but will not do anything.I do not consider myself to be a more decent man that the Minister or Minister of State.  However, they and their Cabinet colleagues have the power to change things.  They can start by reversing these cuts.  They could make a statement by no longer punishing the most vulnerable or crushing the morale of the teachers, communities and people on the front line in this area.  I appeal to them to find their Irishness and spirit and to do justice to the fight of those who came before us.	spk_318

However, when the Dáil last discussed the most recent round of IMF reforms in January of this year, Sinn Féin raised serious concerns about the continued domination of the IMF by the overdeveloped world.  Wealthy countries represent 15% of the membership of the IMF.  Even after the recent reforms we still control 60% of the voting rights.  If Germany or France proposed such a voting arrangement in the European Union, no party in this House would support it.The IMF is in urgent need of real reform and central to it is giving the developing world an equal say in how it is run.  There is an argument that those countries most affected by IMF policies should have a greater say in how it operates.  There is also a need for the IMF to abandon the use of policy conditionality attached to its loans.  Clearly there is a need for a lender of last resort on the international stage and the IMF is an appropriate body to fulfil this function.However, it should lend money solely on the basis that it has a reasonable expectation of the money being repaid.  It should not be in the business of imposing any particular economic philosophy or democratically-elected governments in return for loans.  The impact of so-called structural adjustment programmes in Africa and Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s has been devastating.  Country after country has seen poverty rates increase, expenditure on education and social services fall and democracy undermined.  Meanwhile, international corporations and local elites profit off the back of widespread misery and social dislocation.Mali is a case in point.  It is one of the poorest countries in the world in that 90% of its population lives on less than $2 a day.  The consequences of the IMF's most recent involvement in it are stark.  Utility prices rose dramatically following privatisation, cotton prices dropped heavily following trade liberalisation and development aid from the World Bank to the value of $72 million was blocked.  All of this made the poor majority of the country even poorer.  It is hardly a record to be proud of.There is also a need for the IMF to seriously consider the amount of money it pays its senior management and staff.  Dominique Strauss-Kahn received a salary $441,980 in 2010, more than the Presidents of France or the US receive.  As if this were not enough, the former IMF chief also received an annual expense allowance of $79,120.  To cap it off, his IMF income was tax-free.  It is nice arrangement.Considering the level of financial hardship imposed on ordinary people living in those countries who borrow from the IMF, these kind of excessive salaries, allowances and tax breaks are not only wrong, but undermine public confidence in the fund.  As we know from our experience of IMF involvement in Irish affairs, the cost of borrowing money is crippling austerity and repeated bailouts for the banks.  I take this opportunity to remind the House of the impact of the IMF austerity programme on ordinary citizens in this State.It was not long ago that the parties now in government joined Sinn Féin in opposition to the actions of Fianna Fáil.  There was a time when we were all in this together, standing up for the rights and welfare of ordinary citizens.  The Fine Gael and Labour parties opposed the IMF-EU deal.  Both parties campaigned aggressively during the general election campaign for a renegotiation of the agreement.  They promised if elected to break with the failed policies of austerity and bank bailouts that were preceded by the previous Government.  Yet, less than 12 months since the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party took office the very same politicians who once opposed the actions of the IMF and Ireland have become its biggest cheerleaders.If anyone is in any doubt, he or she should look at the issues that have dominated the Dáil this week.  A Labour Party Minister for Social Protection cut 15 separate social welfare payments and funding for community employment schemes.  A Labour Party Minister for Education and Skills cut funds for disadvantaged schools.  A Fine Gael Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government imposed a flat rate household charge and a punitive septic tank charge.  A Fine Gael Minister for Finance increased VAT by 2% and a Labour Party Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform slashed 6,000 public sector jobs in a single year.These are the policies once pursued by the previous Government but now enthusiastically promoted by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, all under the watchful eye of the troika.  Behind the political rhetoric are the real human stories of hardship and misery.  The hodgepodge arrangement the delegates at the summit came up with is no solution to the crisis in Europe and the Minister knows that.No solution that condemns people in Ireland and other countries in Europe to a lost decade of austerity and limited economic growth will work.  Even the proposition to involve the IMF in this arrangement is already facing criticism in Estonia and the Czech Republic from the German Central Bank, Canada and Japan.  They are not comfortable with the so-called solution that has been cobbled together.The comments made yesterday to the effect that this is a referendum on Ireland's future in terms of the euro demean the office of the Minister.  That type of approach is outrageous scaremongering.Above all, it is inaccurate.  At a time when people are weary and in despair and businesses are seeking a ray of hope, they do not need that type of irresponsible rhetoric from the Minister in charge of the most important portfolio in Government excepting that of the Taoiseach.  I urge the Minister to reflect on that.Where is the solution for the banking crisis, debt crisis and investment crisis — the three profound elements to this crisis?  In regard to the first element, we know that many of the banks in the core European states are in serious trouble.  Yet there has been no comprehensive stress testing of those banks, without which we cannot know the extent of their capitalisation requirements.  On the second issue, we have no sense of how we can deal with the sovereign debt crisis faced by this country, Greece and others in a fair way that allows growth to take place.  Worst of all, perhaps, we have no grounds for hope in respect of the third element of the crisis, because there is no strategy in regard to investment.  We are not deploying the immense capacity of the European Investment Bank, together with the member states, to put in place a programme of regeneration.This proposed technical reform of the IMF and the various botched solutions on offer are being presented to the Irish people in the context of our future in Europe and with a warning that failure to fall into line will lead to Armageddon.  It reminds one of the announcement of a movie sequel, ""If you thought the last one was bad, wait until you see the next one"".  That approach is simply irresponsible.  I hope the Minister will focus henceforth on defending the interests of the Irish people, not by writing letters to Herman Van Rompuy but by raising these issues directly with our European colleagues in an effort to find a solution to this country's difficulty and the difficulties of people throughout Europe.  Our focus must be on a collective resolution to the economic crisis that is devastating the people of Ireland and of Europe, and it must be done in a sensible and measured fashion."	spk_287

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-12-14	dail	31	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_12	The Taoiseach will remember the two Lisbon treaty campaigns.  The first followed the decision by the people of France and the Netherlands, in referenda in their respective countries, to reject the proposed European constitution and the direction in which Europe was going.  In France, in particular, there was a huge engagement with civil society, including townhall meetings throughout the state, and the people ultimately decided to reject the proposition.  However, unelected officials in Europe, in cahoots with our elected leaders, decided to rejig the constitution, abandon the national anthem and flag and so on, and repackage it as the Lisbon treaty.  When it was put to the Irish people, the same process took place as had done in France, with townhall meetings throughout the State, and the Irish people rejected the proposition.Did the EU then take a long, hard look at itself and seek a new direction?  Absolutely not.  Instead we had the spectacle of Mr. Sarkozy coming to the French Embassy in Dublin and beguiling the Irish people.  The second Lisbon treaty campaign saw both party leaders opposite promising the moon and stars, offering gold, frankincense and myrrh to the Irish people and promising us a wonderful future if only we would cease blocking progress in Europe.  We are now in an economic mess because of the direction that was taken in Europe.  Yet the Government cannot even tell us whether a referendum on last Friday's agreement will be held.  Instead, it is hedging around the text of the agreement and citing the need for advice from the Attorney General.  When we repeatedly asked the Taoiseach in the Chamber to publish the advice from the Attorney General regarding the failure to put the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, agreement before the Irish people, he refused to do so and would not even inform us of the logic and rationale behind that decision.  I am not terribly confident of our chances of getting a say on this matter.  We will have to wait and see.I will read out a list of names before inviting the Taoiseach to identify the common denominator: Peter Sutherland, former Attorney General and former Irish Commissioner in Europe; Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank; Mario Monti, technocratic new Prime Minister of Italy and former Commissioner in two different portfolios; Antonio Borges, former head of the European division in the IMF, recently resigned; Otmar Issing, board member of the German Bundesbank and the ECB; and Lucas Papademos, new technocratic Prime Minister of Greece and former head of the Greek Central Bank, which is partly responsible for the mess in which that country finds itself.  What is the common denominator?  All of them have either served on boards of Goldman Sachs, advised that company or presided over deals with it.  The people who are primarily responsible for the mess and economic devastation caused across Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain and so many other countries are at the head of this and are pulling the strings, controlling the mechanisms.The Taoiseach is father of the House.  I have asked him on many occasions if he ever imagined that he would sell a pup to the Irish people and that he would see the rewarding of those who, through their greed and recklessness, destroyed the hope of so many people across Europe, and who have remained at the helm and are calling the shots.  This is a hijack of democracy.  It is a scandal on which future historians will judge us harshly.  What side will the Taoiseach take?  He could have made his stand at that summit; he could have found some inspiration from those who came before us.  He could have argued that this is economic madness.  There is no solution to the banking crisis, no solution to the debt crisis and certainly there is no solution to the investment challenge.  This is absolute insanity that at a time in a cycle of recession, of profound economic hardship across the Continent, but particularly in the peripheral European states, we would actually push more austerity onto the people; that we would not counter the cycle - as has always been the classic advice in economics; that we would not intervene; that we would not use our public combined immense resources to stimulate the economy to give our people hope; that we would not use the resources of the European Investment Bank to twin with other member states to address this crisis; that we would not punish those responsible; that we would not challenge those who have caused this recklessness; and that we have not fundamentally changed the international financial system to make it learn the necessary lessons and that we would hold it accountable.  How can we stand over this?  This is the hijacking of our people's democracy.  This is a surrender of our hope and our ambitions to the lobbies, to the people who control the corridors in Brussels.  When will we confront these people?I believe the Taoiseach knows in his heart that I am right and that he agrees with me.  At what point will he make that stand?  At what point will he give hope to the Irish people who are weary, in despair and who have been burdened by all the cuts?  At what point will he make his name in history for all the right reasons?  The Taoiseach has big choices to make over the next couple of years.  He can either go along with this insanity, this madness and condemn our people to a lost decade or he can put his name in history and he join those proud names remembered in this building.  I ask him to look at the busts of those heroes in this Chamber. He can either join them in the annals of Irish history or he can join Goldman Sachs.  The choice is his.	spk_295

That is what our Parliament has been reduced to.  Some of the most critically important decisions which impact on our State, including the further transfer of economic sovereignty to others who are not accountable to our people, must be accessed through newspaper leaks.  That is what is happening here today and it is what we have been reduced to.  We are seeing an attempt to bypass democracy and deny the Irish people a say in this matter.  On two occasions the Irish people have rejected propositions put to them in referenda, which were endorsed by Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and a plethora of their friends in business and civil society.  The people rejected them but were not allowed to say ""No"", so the propositions were put before them again.  The most recent episode was the Lisbon treaty, when the people were promised jobs and prosperity.  They were promised the sun, moon and stars if they would only change their minds.One of the issues that Sinn Féin warned about was article 26 with the passarelle or escalator clause, which would allow governments in future to amend treaties without recourse of the Irish people.  They could then make profound decisions without having to come back to the people.  Sinn Féin warned about that but we were told that we were scare-mongers.  We now know that Mr. Van Rompuy is putting that exact proposition to our leaders in the coming days.  Will they bypass the will of the Irish people?  Will our Government transfer more of our economic sovereignty to those who have failed us?Let us be very clear about this matter.  In the late 1990s, the Irish economy was moving in the right direction.  We could see the beginnings of what would have been a genuine Celtic tiger.  Investment in education was starting to provide a return, exports were growing and it was an exciting time.  We then entered the eurozone and our banks were fed with a river of credit from other European banking institutions.  Twinned with a dramatic reduction in interest rates, it was like crack cocaine.  It created a massive bubble in our economy whereby people could access credit without an difficulty and the housing sector was exploding.  This pressed up wage demands creating all sorts of crazy difficulties and we ended up with a perfect storm.There is a collective responsibility at European level for what went wrong in private banking institutions in Ireland.  We have been asked to shoulder that burden.  Seven times in a row there have been fiscal adjustments that delivered unbelievable hardship to our people.  What will the Government do?  It will reward the very people who created this mess, giving them even more powers without recourse to the Irish people.  If the Taoiseach comes back this weekend having agreed to an amendment of the Lisbon treaty that concedes more of our economic sovereignty, then shame on him and his Ministers.  If they betray the Irish people this weekend, then shame on them if they stand on the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising outside the GPO and claim to be the inheritors of that tradition."	spk_190

It is incredible that the Taoiseach in his address to the Irish people or any Minister or Deputy in government can argue that their strategy is to see economic growth in our country while they have overseen the removal of €3,800 million from this economy.  This is the seventh fiscal adjustment in a row, according to Social Justice Ireland, in which austerity has taken place.  This policy has failed spectacularly.  It has put more than 450,000 of our people on the dole and has brought back the spectre of emigration yet again to our rural communities.I come from the Inishowen Peninsula, the most northern peninsula on the island, and my peninsula and county have seen more than their fair share of emigration.  My grandfather had to emigrate.  He had to send money home at times and he had to come home and build a family home.  My father had to emigrate before he was 15 years of age.  I have had to emigrate in my time and virtually all my extended family in terms of those who are in their twenties are overseas.  Many chairs around tables this Christmas will be empty across Inishowen and Donegal.The unemployment numbers in my home peninsula of Inishowen have decreased from 5,000 to 4,500.  I would like to report that is because of a surge of employment, but it is because of emigration.  That is what is happening to our communities.I do not plead that I am better than and care more than the Government Deputies.  I plead and appeal to the sense of Irishness and decency of the Ministers present.  What is happening is so wrong — that we would allow a scenario whereby we will pass on €1,200 million of our money to unsecured bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank, and we have done so in recent times with the payment of €750 million.  How will future generations, who will probably be living overseas, our grandchild will probably be living in Australia or America, judge us on that?  They will read about this situation in books.  They will not be here.  They will judge us very harshly because they have been denied a future in their own country.  That is the reality of all this.I listened to talk from the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, about fiscal responsibility.  The facts are that before Ireland entered the euro in the late 1990s we had economic regeneration, export and employment growth and something that genuinely would have been a Celtic tiger and that was sustainable, but when we joined the euro, our banks, those reckless private institutions, were able to access unlimited amounts of cashflow from other European banks which, combined with low interest rates from being in the euro, was like crack cocaine.  There was no regulation.  It was not only an Irish but a European and an international problem.  It was a complete systematic failure of capitalism.  The Irish people were not responsible for it.  They listened to those in politics and leadership, supported Maastricht and the other treaties eventually, took all the assurances that came to them, did what they were asked to do and now they are being punished beyond belief.  We see the blight of emigration and the impact it has on rural communities.I want to outline for Members opposite some of the impact this budget will have on rural communities.  It will result in the closure of Garda stations, the loss of policing services in rural areas and proper policing services as opposed to simply a garda driving around an area in a car every now and again, the threat of bed closures and the closure of community hospitals and nursing units, the loss of funding for basic maintenance of rural roads, the closure of library services in local authority areas because replacement staff cannot be found thanks to the moratorium on recruitment, the erosion of rural transport services, poor and all as they are, a two thirds cut in the value of grants for those on community employment schemes, cuts to schools — I could go on.  This is madness: it is insane.  No economist on the left, right or in the centre ground in the world believes this makes sense.  One cannot cut one's way out of this profound recession.  That policy is failing.The Chinese had a form of capital punishment called death by a thousand cuts.  That is what this budget is — it comprises a plethora of small cuts that combined is choking the lives out of our people.  However, in his address to our people the Taoiseach stated they were not responsible for this economic malaise and crisis.  How can the Government stand over this?  I do not preach that I am better than those on the Government benches.  I do not claim to be a better person and I do not claim to care more.  I presume we care the same, or perhaps those on the Government benches care more, but how can they stand over this?  How can they possibly go back to the communities where they were born and reared and meet the people with whom they grew up——	spk_655

Do they believe in their hearts that there are adequate bus services to workplaces, schools or post offices in their communities?  There have been cutbacks to all those rural transport schemes.  If this money was being ring-fenced for a revolutionary approach to public transport infrastructure in rural areas, we could buy into it, but that is not happening.Have Government Deputies been listening to hauliers in their rural constituencies?

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-11-30	dail	31	Pre-European Council Meeting on 8-9 December: Statements	dbsect_7	He is a very good analyst on economic affairs and it is a pity he was not listened to more often.  He wrote about the role of government.  When an economy over-heats, one expects to see interest rates rising, to see regulation, a calming down and some moderation and some intervention.  In a recession one expects to see a government intervening to stimulate the economy to see interest rates falling and banks being encouraged to get the economy moving again.  Everything that has been done at European level in recent years has been pro-cyclical, which is crazy.  How can an economy grow if the banks are not able to lend and when heavily indebted areas face rising interest rates?  How can an economy grow by taking away resources from those whose spending is essential to the economy?  It is absolutely bonkers.  Economists on both the left and the right of the equation agree on this. There has been a complete failure of economic intervention at European level.In Ireland, regulation failed.  Our Central Bank and the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance and our Government, failed.  It was a failure not just by Ireland but also at European level but I ask where has been the collective sharing of responsibility.  The leaders of Europe say there has to be burden-sharing in Greece but, incredibly, we have to pay the unsecured bondholders.  These are not the people who bought in the primary bond markets rather these are the people who bought in the secondary markets.  We have to pay them over €1.2 billion in January and further hundreds of millions of euro later next year.The Taoiseach and his Ministers know this is bonkers.  If the Taoiseach was having a private pint with his friends he would say it was wrong and it is bonkers yet we sit here and read out these speeches.  As my party leader pointed out, the speechwriters have written that this is a great deal but it is madness.  We say that Herman Van Rompuy is doing a great job but his strings are being pulled by the Franco-German axis with regard to his response to his crisis.  Our people are having to endure sustained periods of austerity, they have to watch the return of the blight of emigration to our island and also deal with unemployment.  Now, they must watch the news about the eurozone crisis and the continued failure to deal with it by the European Union.The European banking authority stress-tested 24 banks last July and it was all supposed to have been sorted out but now, Dexia is collapsing.  We do not have full, open accountability within the European banking system.  For example, we do not have the unleashing of the significant potential of the European Investment Bank which has twice the capacity of the World Bank to get the Irish economy moving.  At what point do we in Ireland speak out and say that what is happening is fundamentally wrong?I ask the Taoiseach if he is going to stand at the podium on the centenary of the 1916 Rising and be mindful of all that is in the Proclamation and of the vision of the men and women of that period, knowing that he has ceded more fiscal powers to that failed process and entity.  He inherited the loss of economic sovereignty but he did not fight like a lion to get it back again and he actually ceded more.  He allowed people to use this crisis to further their objectives of increased integration.  There is no point in the Irish people voting in the general election that may well be held in 2016.  In a functioning democracy, political parties argue about whether public services are to be strengthened or weakened, whether privatisation of public services is to be continued.  These are the usual debates.  However, the people will have a choice which will be pointless because those decisions will have been made already.  The capacity to stimulate the economy, the capacity to be brave, to be imaginative, to be creative, will all have been strangled.  This House will become a super-council.  This is not the legacy we want on the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising.I appeal to the Taoiseach.  He knows we are right and that at some point, somebody has to make a stand against this madness.  Somebody has to say there is a five hundred pound gorilla in this room and I am no longer going to ignore it; I will say it out loud and I will call it.  I urge the Taoiseach to find his roots.  When he was elected to this House back in the mid-1970s as a bright young man and with all his hopes and ambitions I am sure he never dreamed that he might be the Taoiseach who gave away our economic sovereignty and betrayed the legacy of 1916.  That is the Taoiseach's choice and his legacy.  The next two years will tell their own story.	spk_258
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-11-30	dail	31	Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_29	Deputy Pearse Doherty and I are from Donegal.  What sticks in the craw of Donegal people is the fact that, historically, hundreds of millions of euro have been invested every year in the capital wastewater budget which is spent in the cities and towns throughout the State to comply with EU directives.  At the same time, people who wished to build single homes in Donegal and other rural areas paid their own costs.  They paid for planning permission, installation, the site assessments and all the other costs involved, without any subsidy or support.  It often cost thousands of euro to do so.  They paid their own way.We now have a Bill that essentially asks them to pay the costs of potential replacement also.  They complied with planning permission and departmental guidelines, went through that process and paid in full for it.  There was no subsidy, as urban dwellers have received.  Now, they must pay again.  They are beginning to think, ironically in the context of this subject, that a tax might be imposed on fresh air or there might be a tax on living in rural areas.  These communities are also watching the threatened closure of Garda stations, small community hospitals and nursing units come under threat while the post office infrastructure and rural transport networks are also under threat.A picture is developing of the dismantling of the community, physical and public infrastructure of rural Ireland.  This Bill is the final straw.  That is the reason petitions with thousands of names are being sent from counties such as Donegal to the Minister.  That is the reason there are packed public meetings being held throughout the county.  There is profound concern about this Bill.We still do not have specific information from the Minister.  What is the specification for what is required under the legislation?  That would clarify matters.  We do not have such specification.  There are references to the Cavan model and the fact that Ireland has been taken to the European Court of Justice.  If we have been taken to that court and if Cavan has been found to have an acceptable model, there must be a specification for that model.  However, it has not been presented to us, so we cannot reassure people in places such as Donegal who are profoundly concerned.Hundreds of millions of euro have historically been invested each year in the capital wastewater programme.  This money is distributed through the various councils across the State.  Why can some of that budget not be reallocated to grant aid people who have to replace their system?  We have been given assurances from the Minister that he will examine this but that is not acceptable.  I am anxious to convey to the Minister, if I can get his attention, that the key issue of concern to people in rural areas is the cost of replacement.  They are terrified.  A man called to me a few days ago and he outlined the reality for his family and the family home they have had for years.  They fear they will not reach the specification, which we do not have at this point.  They are terrified at the prospect of a cost amounting to thousands at this time.Before the Minister can seek the support of the House, he must reassure those families and deal with the double standard of urban dwellers having all these facilities free of charge while rural dwellers are being asked to pay, yet again, to comply with an EU directive.  That is an injustice.  It leaves people in Donegal and other rural areas with the sense that there is one law for rural communities.  This must be addressed before the Minister can seek or expect the support of the House.	spk_616
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-11-30	dail	31	Social Welfare Benefits: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_35	I note there are only three Labour Party Deputies in the Chamber.  I assume their 34 colleagues will join them to vote against this motion later this evening.  My party colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, the Sinn Féin spokesperson for social protection, referred to the Labour Party's 2009 Private Members' motion which had the same demands as tonight's Sinn Féin motion.  When debating its motion in 2009, the Labour Deputies used emotive and passionate language.  I would be particularly mindful of the comments made then by Deputy Joan Burton, now the Minister for Social Protection, and Deputy Róisín Shortall, now a Minister of State at the Department of Health.  Their arguments for retaining child benefit were compelling and reflective of how much it is a stimulus to the economy.  For a typical low or middle-income family with three children, a €10 reduction in child benefit may not sound much but over a year that would come to €360.  That is a lot of money for an ordinary family in these difficult times.I will not preach to the Labour Party Deputies opposite because they represent the same type of people I represent.  However, during the general election the Labour Party published a poster on what Fine Gael would do to social welfare benefits and how Labour could be counted on to protect them.  Will those three Labour Deputies here in the Chamber, along with the rest of their parliamentary colleagues, honour this commitment?  Will they demonstrate a reduction in child benefit is a red-line issue for them in government?  Will they defend the interests of those families and children who rely on this benefit to pay the bills every month?Earlier today I, along with my party leader, Deputy Adams, challenged the Taoiseach to change the Government's focus on its macro-policy of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank's unsecured bondholders to the tune of €715 million recently and €1.2 billion next January.  Even if this is a kite to soften the blow in the budget, it is a cruel exercise.  I do not presume to have a monopoly over decency, nor do I wish to preach to Deputies.  However, it is shocking and wrong not to stand up to our so-called European partners and refuse to pay international gamblers who purchased bonds in secondary markets while cutting child benefit which will affect the most vulnerable in our society.Instead, the Government can put in place a 48% tax on those earning over €100,000 which would raise over €400 million a year.  If the Government introduced a 1% tax on assets of over €1 million, excluding farm land and property, it would raise €800 million a year.  The yield from these new tax measures would amount to €1.2 billion which the Government should not pay to unsecured bondholders.  At the very least, the Government should put up a fight and become the squeaking wheel, which Greece has been for so long, on behalf of the Irish people.Tonight, the Labour Party Members will vote against the very proposition they put to the House two years ago.  They should not betray the people they represent.  As we learned last February, the people will wait in the long grass to give their retribution.  The Labour Party Members should do the right thing instead and vote with the Sinn Féin motion tonight.	spk_857

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-11-09	dail	31	Promissory Notes: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_36	"I have listened with great interest to the Government's terminology, particularly that used by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in the House last night.  According to the Government, this is a solemn sovereign agreement into which the previous Government entered on behalf of the Irish people.  Therefore, even though the people overwhelmingly rejected the previous Government and elected a new one, we must honour this solemn sovereign agreement.  The Minister's speech, which was handed to us last night, read: ""I respectfully suggest that unilateral action or ""gun boat diplomacy"" will not serve the country's best interests"".  This is the Government's rationale.Here I stand, a Teachta Dála for Donegal North-East.  Sitting beside me is the Teachta Dála for Donegal South-West, Deputy Doherty.  Along with other political, business, tourism and community representatives in the north west, he and I have campaigned for many years for equality in road infrastructure for our people.  Motorways go from Dublin to Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Belfast.  It is right that each of these regions is linked to the capital city, but 500,000 people in the north west are not linked to it.  This injustice was to have been addressed under the solemn sovereign agreement made by the Government at St. Andrew's in 2006.  Deputy Doherty and I were present at the time and understood that the agreement would be honoured.  Today, we found out that the Government was walking away from the agreement unilaterally.  Those opposite can call it ""gun boat diplomacy"" if they like, but it has a devastating impact on the people of our region.In recent days, the Government paid €715 million to unsecured, unguaranteed bondholders, yet we do not know who they are.  The leader of our country could not tell us who they were.  In January, the Government will hand over a further €1.2 billion, some three times the contribution promised by the previous Government to the people of County Donegal and the north west as part of the peace process, a binding, international, solemn agreement.Government Members are complete hypocrites.  Their arguments in the House today have no credibility.  When they all line up along the Government benches in approximately 30 minutes to do their duty as usual and vote with the Government, they will have no credibility in the eyes of the people of County Donegal, the north west and the Six Counties.  The suggestion that this project should be pushed back five years is outrageous.  I remind the Government that, with all of the hardship across the island, counties Donegal, Derry and Tyrone have the highest levels of unemployment and economic deprivation.  We have no rail link with Dublin, never mind a motorway link.  We will not wait the five years suggested by the Government, but ten years.  How is that solemn sovereign agreement being honoured?The Government will honour its agreements with bondholders, gamblers and hedge fund speculators who made 50% gains by believing it would not do what it claimed it would before the election in February, but it will renege on the people on this island who need help the most, the people of the north west who have endured these economic circumstances for many years.  Government Members have no credibility in their arguments.  The Sinn Féin motion should be passed and the Government should make a stand.  I implore it to have consistency, courage and dignity at this stage."	spk_390

I will not remind them of what they said before the general election because my party leader has already done so.

Are they hedge fund speculators, as has been reported?  Did they pay knock-down prices, in the correct belief the Government would pay them in full?  Are speculators in Paris, Frankfurt and New York popping open champagne bottles to celebrate the decision of the Minister?  They must have known he was talking nonsense when he made his speech in New York.  Like the grand old Duke of York, he went to the top of the hill, but nothing happened thereafter.  They can count on him as they pop champagne bottles in celebration.  Who are the hedge fund gamblers who have made a killing on the backs of the people today?  Is Goldman Sachs involved?  It is on the list in the public domain.  Is the former Attorney General, Mr. Peter Sutherland, involved?  He told the people they should pay the bondholders.  Is his company benefiting?  Why can the Government not give the names of the bondholders to the people who are paying them?  In the absence of information, we can only presume that hedge fund speculators are having a fantastic day at the races today.I would like to refer to the decision of the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Papandreou, to have a referendum in that country.  Why is the Government not giving the people an opportunity to have their say on the huge burden they are facing?  A further €3.6 billion in cuts will be made in the forthcoming budget.  Why did the Government decide, on the advice of the Attorney General, that the European Stability Mechanism did not have to be put to the people?  Why will the Government not publish the advice of the Attorney General?  Like my party leader, Deputy Adams, our finance spokesperson, Deputy Pearse Doherty, and other Sinn Féin Deputies, I have repeatedly asked the Government to publish the Attorney General's advice, but it has consistently refused to do so.  The Government is not prepared to allow the people to vote in a referendum on the issue.  It is not even prepared to explain why that is the case.As a result of their protests and campaigns, it looks like the people of Greece will at least have a say on the decisions that will impact on them.  I suggest this proposition would be rejected by the peoples of Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy because it has failed.  I also expect it to be rejected by the people of Greece.  There are three aspects to the issue.  It is a question of unsustainable debt, a banking crisis that has not been properly addressed and a systemic banking failure, not at Irish or Greek levels but at European and international levels.  In the banking system there was a failure of regulation and prudence and people in countries such as Ireland, Greece and Portugal have been forced to saddle the burden.The Taoiseach is smiling on the other side of the House.  Since his election to this House after winning a by-election in the 1970s, he has put himself before the people to the extent that he is now the father of the House.  I take it that his commitment to politics is absolute and that he wants to see change.  Does he believe in his heart that it is fair and acceptable that the people are facing another austerity budget to pay the private debts of bankers who gambled recklessly, took advantage of failures of regulation and accountability and are now benefitting from the crisis?  Does he think it is fair that we may be forced to partially or fully privatise our assets and suffer austerity, unemployment and emigration in order to reward a system that has utterly failed the people?  I do not think he believes in his heart that that is fair.  I do not think the Minister does so either.What would be the right thing to do?  Somebody will have to take a stand at some point by saying this is crazy, unsustainable and has to change.  Who will do this?  Will it be the Minister?  Will it be the Taoiseach?  They have to ask themselves these questions.  When the Taoiseach won a by-election in the 1970s and took a seat in this House, just as the new Labour Party Deputy did today, did he think he would be in a position to see the people utterly failed?	spk_228

There is massive interest among the Irish people in this.  In that context, I would like the Taoiseach to tell us two things.  What is the rationale for the ECB insisting we pay these unsecured bondholders today and that we pay €1.2 billion in January and a further €2.5 billion in 2012?  How does the ECB define contagion?  How does it define the impact this might have in Europe?Can the Taoiseach tell us who are these bondholders?  We have hedge fund speculators who have purchased these bonds from the original bondholders at a knock down price and have now benefitted from the Government's decision to allow this to be paid.  If the Taoiseach cannot tell us who these bondholders are, can he please tell us what legal barrier is in the way of him sourcing this information and putting it into the public domain?	spk_269

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-10-26	dail	31	EU Summits: Statements	dbsect_9	My colleague, Deputy Adams, outlined how our national interest should be reflected in the discussions at the EU summit.  I share his concerns.  There is a need to assert our national interest and the sovereignty of our State.  However, what is shaping up as a bad deal for us will also be a bad deal for all of Europe.  It looks like the summit will continue to follow the mistakes of the past.  European leaders are doing too little, too late.  They are placing the demands of wealthy bankers ahead of the needs of the citizens and pursuing austerity when we should be promoting growth.  We need to put an end to this.  What we know of the tentative agreement at the weekend is that it will continue the failed practice of cutbacks, taking money from taxpayers to bail out banks and placing the burden onto the economies of peripheral states.  We are told that they are considering a Europe-wide banking bailout without knowing the cost of the bank recapitalisation.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can bring the Anglo Irish Bank case study to the summit to demonstrate what happens when one gives a blank cheque to bankers.Austerity and bank bailouts will not lead to growth across Europe, the stability of the euro or reduced debt levels.  It has failed here, failed in Greece and Portugal and it will fail in the European economy.  I accept that we are not Greece and Portugal but the approach of austerity has failed in all economies.  What makes European leaders believe it will work across the EU?  A number of steps are required at European level if we are to deliver growth and stability across Europe.  We need honesty and we need to know the true level of the banking losses.  The current EU stress tests failed to deal with the exposure of banks to sovereign debt and continue to overvalue property assets.  Once we know the full extent of the problem, we can begin to act.Reports today suggest the banks are opposed to a substantial write-down, which is no surprise.  This is a crisis in banking and finance.  Without a substantial write-down, the alternative is an unstructured default, which will have a greater impact on banks.  The banks are involved in a game of bluff and that bluff needs to be called.  The banks need to step up to the mark and take responsibility for the mess they have created.  They must be forced to write down the cost of their bad debts as a condition of any future recapitalisation.  The cost of recapitalisation should not be borne by ordinary taxpayers across the EU.  An enlarged EFSF is not the vehicle for recapitalisation.  The ECB should become the lender of last resort for the European banking system.  The ECB performs this function in a number of countries, including Ireland.  Rather than printing euro to buy the bonds of European economies, the ECB would be better placed redirecting these facilities to stabilise the European banking system.Alongside recapitalisation, we need to promote economic growth and employment.  In the absence of private sector investment, we need a European stimulus to complement stimulus programmes in individual member states.  The European Investment Bank has twice the lending capacity of the World Bank and it must use this capacity, with national governments, to increase the level of investment and create employment and build infrastructure.I fear the grand bargain, as it was called at the weekend, will be the failed approach of the previous Irish Government implemented at a European level.  I hope that the Taoiseach brings our experiences with him and that he will carry with him the story of many thousands who are on the dole or were forced to emigrate.  I hope he will demonstrate clearly that the approach advocated has further depressed our economy.  That approach has failed the State and it will fail the European economy.  It is remarkable to see an absence of political leadership for so long in Europe and the lack of any real solidarity or a solution.  Now, we see the spectacle of David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy exchanging insults and President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel laughing when asked whether Prime Minister Berlusconi's government in Italy is capable of repaying.  This is a damning and symbolic message to send to the people of Europe.  To repeat the mistakes made in Ireland and the crazy policy of writing a blank cheque for bankers without carrying out due diligence on the European banking system will lead to profound disaster, even worse than what we have now.	spk_221

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-10-12	dail	31	EU Summits: Statements	dbsect_5	"There is a financial crisis in Europe, one that is fast becoming a political farce.  The spectacle of yet another Franco-German summit in recent days sends a clear message to the world about the current status of the European Union as a so-called partnership of equal sovereign states.  Ireland's citizens have been forced to accept punishing austerity budget after budget over recent years.  Along with the citizens of Greece and Portugal, we have been forced to bail out the banking system in the core, powerful European countries and have this labelled something else to the rest of the world.Our elected political leaders are reduced to playing the bold child who must sit on the stairs until their disappointed parents are satisfied that they have learned their lesson.  That is the level of influence this Government now has on EU policy.  We were once in a lead role, but were reduced to the chorus line.   It would now appear that we walked off the stage and now sit in the audience.  We are spectators to the decision-making of others.  This Government has allowed the partnership of equals that was Europe to be reduced to the sole ownership of Germany and France.Last weekend, we were told of a Franco-German summit that would resolve the European crisis.  Were we invited?  Were our views sought?  Was the Government consulted?  By the end of the weekend, we were told that a deal had been reached that would resolve the crisis.  Were our views sought?  Was the Government consulted?  We were then told that the summit was postponed and that no deal had been reached.  Were our views sought?  Was the Government consulted?  A two-handed farce and we are the audience.  We are now told that President Barroso has a plan, will unveil it today and will tell the Taoiseach tomorrow.  Were our views sought and was the Government consulted by Barroso?  A two-handed farce and now a one-man show.  It would be funny if the stakes were not so high.The economic and political world is looking in, wondering what is going on.  What line will the EU agree to for the G20?  Will it be the French way, the German way or President Barroso's way?  We know for sure that it will not be Eamon Gilmore's and Labour's way.  This lack of clarity at a European-wide level is matched only by the confusion within this Government.  We have had the Taoiseach say ""No"" to treaty change, the Tánaiste claiming rather sheepishly that there is no need for a referendum but that the issues could be dealt with under the existing treaty and yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, opened the possibility of treaty change.  While this circus is ongoing, we have unemployment continuing at 14.4%.  Almost half of those on the live register have been unemployed for a year or more.  We have 80,000 young people on the live register and at least 40,000 of our people are expected to emigrate this year.I say to the Taoiseach that another way is possible.  It is about putting the needs of our people before the needs of the bankers.  A number of key steps must be taken at European and national level if we are to have any hope of delivering social and economic recovery.  First of all, we need honesty, a word not used lightly in the banking world.  We must honestly assess the level of banking undercapitalisation.  The EU stress tests are not robust or honest, as demonstrated as one banking crisis follows another.  On the basis of the most recent round of crisis meetings in Brussels and Frankfurt, it is clear that the critics of the European Banking Authority were right and that the extent of the black hole at the heart of European banking is not yet clear.  Rigorous and compulsory stress tests are now required as a matter of urgency.  Once we know the full extent of the problem, we can begin to act.The banks must shoulder their responsibility.  They must be forced to write down the cost of their bad debts as a prerequisite to any recapitalisation.   The cost of recapitalisation should not be borne by ordinary taxpayers, particularly given the crippling levels of austerity being imposed on people across the EU.This is an issue not only in respect of EU-wide debt.  The same approach should also be applied by national Governments with regard to their own banking sectors.  Sinn Féin has long argued for a significant write-down of banking debt imposed on the State by Fianna Fáil and maintained by this Fine Gael-Labour Government.  The Greek Government has managed to secure significant private sector participation in its debt restructuring yet our Government has failed to secure the same.  It is not credible for the Minister of Finance, on behalf of the Government, to claim that a similar deal cannot be secured for Ireland.  The changes that have been achieved to date, which have led to some assistance to the Irish people, have been due to the crises in Greece, Portugal and Italy.  Negotiating such a write-down, including the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note of over €74 billion, must be a priority for the Government in any talks on a long-term solution to the eurozone crisis.Following a robust assessment of levels of debt and the debt write-down by banks, there is a need to begin the process of recapitalisation.  An enlarged EFSF is not the vehicle for meeting the funding requirements of cleansed banks.  Rather, the ECB must become the lender of last resort for the European banking system.  The ECB is already performing this function in a number of countries, including in Ireland.  Rather than printing euros to buy the bonds of European economies, the ECB would be better placed to redirect these facilities to stabilise the European banking system.  These measures will only deal with the banking crisis.  However, we need to promote economic growth and employment as complementary and concurrent to action taken to deliver jobs and economic growth.The EU must once and for all abandon the orthodoxy of austerity.  It is failing and leads only to hardship and recession.  The banking crisis has led to a crisis of under investment.  Each round of austerity further reduces investment in the domestic economy, forcing more people out of work.  In the absence of private sector investment, we need the State to fill the investment vacuum.  We need a Europe-wide stimulus programme to complement stimulus programmes in individual member states.  The European Investment Bank has twice the lending capacity of the World Bank.  It must use that capacity with national Governments to increase the level of investment and create employment and build our infrastructure.I have laid a path that must and should be followed at a national and European level.  We have choices to make and we can continue as spectators to the farce that is enveloping the EU institutions.  Regardless of our differences now, we share a common republican heritage, a republican heritage in which our leaders were told that no change was possible, that we were not in control of our destiny and that we should know our place.  Yet history tells us that we always have choices to make and that these require leadership, determination and leading from the front.  Wolfe Tone recognised it when he met with his comrades on Cave Hill in Belfast.  The leaders of 1916 in Dublin knew that when they set out on Easter Sunday morning.  Bobby Sands knew it as he lay alone in his hospital bed.  The Taoiseach has highlighted what needs to be done in his speech to the Institute of Directors when he said:""We will regain our economic sovereignty.  We will restore the good name of Ireland among the nations of the world.  This is my mission.  This is the Government's mission.  This is our mission.  And there will be no rest until we succeed.""If we are to achieve this, we must begin to act.  We must assert the interest of the Irish nation.  We can put the brake on the idea that Europe is led by Germany and France.  We can make it clear in the coming summit that we will not countenance further losses of sovereignty and that it is the will of the people of this sovereign State.  It is not that of Germany, France, bankers or the President of the EU but the people and the Government must act on the will of the people.  We will end the process of being spectators and will begin to assert our national interest.  It is time that we began the process of shaping a Europe that serves the people and it is time for the Government to act and assert the will of the Irish people.  Our sovereignty is not in the gift of others.  We need to assert our sovereignty.  I hope this Government will act but I travel more in hope than expectation."	spk_168
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-10-12	dail	31	Community and Voluntary Sector: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_34	Many years ago, I listened to a speech delivered to the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, comparing the after effects of the potato famine with the unemployment crisis of the 1980s.  It was not so much the famine as the cholera and disease that followed that devastated the people.  It was not so much the unemployment as the drugs crisis in the inner cities, the despair and the lack of hope.  As the economy was turning around, the Taoiseach was asked how he would move people from a kick in the teeth to a kick in the backside to get back to work.People talk the talk about charity as if they were Victorians but they do not really get the real lives of people.  Maybe they are paid too much money, eat in fancy restaurants and have a lifestyle that disconnects them from real people.  Tonight I listened to a presentation from community activists in this city.  The real impact of cuts to the community and voluntary sector, as my friend Deputy Crowe pointed out, is on children who do not have food in their stomachs and educational supports and where resources that fill the gaps left by this economic crisis are taken away.  In this State, policy ensures the reckless and unbelievably wealthy gamblers from other European and international states are paid every cent they are owed while we literally leave people starve in this country.  We literally rob resources from the people in community development who are at the coalface.  The former Minister of State with responsibility for community affairs in 2008 to 2009, John Curran, said the following about the work of community development projects:The projects come from the communities themselves and what really inspires me is people's imagination and their own approach to coming up with solutions to their problems that work.  They are so innovative and flexible and timely in their response that they are doing things the statutory agencies couldn't respond to in a short timeframe.  People's ingenuity always astounds me.Within a year, his Government brought in policies that destroyed community development projects in some cases or integrated them into partnership or development groups where they lost their focus on helping the most disadvantaged.  It is in the style of McCarthy, our own McCarthy in this State, who likes to privatise public resources and take away amenities from the most disadvantaged working-class communities and cities and isolated rural communities.  These are the policies being implemented.To listen to a Labour Deputy come in here like a highlander with a hit-and-run speech about resources in the Six Counties makes me sick because for decades the Labour Party showed no interest in the people of the Six Counties.  They criminalised republicans who stood up for their interests.  Eddie Fullerton, a councillor from my town of Buncrana who was murdered by loyalists, was turned away from this building due to the censorship policies of the Labour Party at the time.  I listened to the Labour Party Member preach about his care for the people of the North, as if one can compare this to a devolved Assembly in the Six Counties that must rely on funding from the central source like a town council or county council.  The Assembly has no sovereignty or control over its affairs and it is being compared to this so-called sovereign institution, where the Labour Party and Fine Gael were elected by disadvantaged, working class communities in many cases, with hope in their hearts that they would allow Deputies to come into this Chamber and fight for their communities.  This is nonsense, obfuscation and distraction.  Every time Sinn Féin raises issues about our communities and the impact cuts and austerity have on real people's lives, we must listen to this hit-and-run obfuscation and nonsense.  At some stage, it must stop and the Labour Party must understand that it represents the same communities I represent.I say this to the one Labour Party Deputy out of almost 40 who is present in the Chamber to listen to this debate.  I do not preach to him and I do not say I am better than him but I appeal to him to start to fight for the communities he represents and do justice for the people who put the Labour Party here.  After five years, the Labour Party should be able to say that it stood up to the right-wing agenda that may exist in Fine Gael, defended their communities and defended them against privatisation, and a sustained and strategic attack by right-wing parties on community and voluntary groups who defend the most disadvantaged in this country.  Let that be the legacy of the Labour Party after five years and let it not be that the Labour Party coalesced with right-wing influences——	spk_466

It is clear that the same environmental circumstances pertain to Ethiopia and Kenya, but they have not faced famine at this point.  What can Ireland do, as part of the international community, to address the food instability crisis as it pertains to Africa, particularly at times like this?  How do we deal with the commodity-based approach to vital crops that could save lives in these areas?  What can Ireland do as part of the European Union?  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade recommended that an EU envoy be sent to the region to address the political instability there.  It is being reported that the al-Shabab group, which has deterred those who are trying to provide aid and save lives, carried out a bombing in Mogadishu today.

However, I urge some of the Deputies who have made these points to examine the roots of the global crisis we are facing.  This crisis was created by a culture of deregulation and free markets gone wild with no accountability to the people.  The genesis of the ideology came in the era of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, and the devastation they created is incalculable.  Twinned with deregulation and free market economics was privatisation.  Whenever powerful countries, be it the United States or the power blocs in the European Union, engage in trade agreements with developing countries, one of the things they have done in return for the money they have lent is ensure the country's vital public services have been privatised.  In one country, Bolivia, the people rebelled and turned that around and inspired people in other countries throughout the developing world.

I would remind the Fine Gael Deputies about some matters.  They will remember the speeches they made about colocation and how concerned they were about cherrypicking.  When a key public service is part-privatised, and I agree with Deputy Ross on this, those who come in to privatise it cherrypick and go after the most profitable elements of that service and the rest is left; eventually the service gets worse and the public is left to carry the can in terms of the critical non-profitable areas.

Throughout the decades, Irish Governments have played a constructive role there.  However, I am stunned to learn that it is the position of the State that the investigation has concluded and that no sabotage to the Like Deputy Boyd Barrett, I have seen the evidence of sabotage.  A man I know to be of the highest integrity, a fisherman called Pat Fitzgerald from Waterford, has clearly outlined that the damage to the propeller shaft would have to have been man-made.  Almost identical damage was done to a sister-ship in the flotilla.  The Minister has asked for evidence.  He should meet the campaign group, Irish Ship to Gaza.  I am sure they would arrange a delegation of some of the flotilla participants to produce the evidence to the Minister and explain why it had to have been man-made.I am shocked that a spokesperson for the Turkish authorities, after a cursory examination, could make a pronouncement that sabotage did not take place.There is a state that held the Palestinian people under military occupation for all of these years.  It was responsible for the slaughter of 1,500 people in Gaza.  It has caused a massive humanitarian crisis which every human rights organisation in the world has condemned.  It murdered nine peace activists on a flotilla last year.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that state is not capable of sabotage of two boats to prevent the completion of a mission that would have been deeply embarrassing to that state?I implore the Minister to meet a delegation and look at the evidence himself.  I trust his integrity.  I ask him to look at the evidence and make up his own mind.	spk_295

Will the Minister consider an independent examination of the evidence they produce?  All it would take is someone with naval engineering experience.  I am confident that this was sabotage of the propeller shaft.  The Minister is well aware of the implications.  It was devious sabotage because it would have caused a failure at sea by forcing the shaft up into the hull, forcing the boat to take on water and sink.  It was a most malicious and devious form of sabotage.  Will the Minister accept a presentation of evidence to him on this matter?  If so, will he have it independently examined if it turns out the Turkish authorities are holding to the position he outlined?	spk_299

In terms of population, only India can compare with China, which has around 1.4 billion people and is the second-largest economy in the world.  It has an important role to play and will have, for God knows how many years to come.  However, there are ongoing genuine concerns about human rights in that vast country, as well as about environmental legislation and the need for reciprocal trade agreements.  The same rules that apply to China in Europe should apply to European investment in China.One statistic here is remarkable.  According to the European Council on Foreign Relations, China's total investment in Europe was around $1.3 billion five years ago; however, from October 2010 to March 2011, Chinese firms and banks committed $64 billion, which represents an immense increase in influence.  One hopes this does not diminish our responsibility to uphold human rights and legitimately question any issues that arise with that country.  It is important that we get the balance right.	spk_312

What interventions can we make with the North Korean Government to end the abominations and crimes against humanity taking place in that country?	spk_286

Throughout the decades, Irish Governments have played a constructive role there.  However, I am stunned to learn that it is the position of the State that the investigation has concluded and that no sabotage to the Like Deputy Boyd Barrett, I have seen the evidence of sabotage.  A man I know to be of the highest integrity, a fisherman called Pat Fitzgerald from Waterford, has clearly outlined that the damage to the propeller shaft would have to have been man-made.  Almost identical damage was done to a sister-ship in the flotilla.  The Minister has asked for evidence.  He should meet the campaign group, Irish Ship to Gaza.  I am sure they would arrange a delegation of some of the flotilla participants to produce the evidence to the Minister and explain why it had to have been man-made.I am shocked that a spokesperson for the Turkish authorities, after a cursory examination, could make a pronouncement that sabotage did not take place.There is a state that held the Palestinian people under military occupation for all of these years.  It was responsible for the slaughter of 1,500 people in Gaza.  It has caused a massive humanitarian crisis which every human rights organisation in the world has condemned.  It murdered nine peace activists on a flotilla last year.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that state is not capable of sabotage of two boats to prevent the completion of a mission that would have been deeply embarrassing to that state?I implore the Minister to meet a delegation and look at the evidence himself.  I trust his integrity.  I ask him to look at the evidence and make up his own mind.	spk_295

Will the Minister consider an independent examination of the evidence they produce?  All it would take is someone with naval engineering experience.  I am confident that this was sabotage of the propeller shaft.  The Minister is well aware of the implications.  It was devious sabotage because it would have caused a failure at sea by forcing the shaft up into the hull, forcing the boat to take on water and sink.  It was a most malicious and devious form of sabotage.  Will the Minister accept a presentation of evidence to him on this matter?  If so, will he have it independently examined if it turns out the Turkish authorities are holding to the position he outlined?	spk_299
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-07-13	dail	31	Human Rights Issues	dbsect_20	The Minister will be aware that historically, one of the great concerns of human rights organisations has been the fact that, all too often, commerce was put ahead of human rights concerns, particularly in the case of Europe and the United States.  In terms of population, only India can compare with China, which has around 1.4 billion people and is the second-largest economy in the world.  It has an important role to play and will have, for God knows how many years to come.  However, there are ongoing genuine concerns about human rights in that vast country, as well as about environmental legislation and the need for reciprocal trade agreements.  The same rules that apply to China in Europe should apply to European investment in China.One statistic here is remarkable.  According to the European Council on Foreign Relations, China's total investment in Europe was around $1.3 billion five years ago; however, from October 2010 to March 2011, Chinese firms and banks committed $64 billion, which represents an immense increase in influence.  One hopes this does not diminish our responsibility to uphold human rights and legitimately question any issues that arise with that country.  It is important that we get the balance right.	spk_312

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-07-05	dail	31	Hospital Services: Motion	dbsect_24	As my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, has dealt comprehensively with the State-wide picture, I intend, as a Deputy representing Donegal North-East, to focus my comments on its local hospital, Letterkenny General Hospital.  The Minister will be aware that not long ago 15,000 people gathered together in a county that previously had not been renowned for massive public protest.  They gathered in the pouring rain to seek equality in cancer care, to ask for services to be upgraded in the region and for the full spectrum of cancer care services to be provided.  That campaign was led by women who had moved to County Donegal from Scotland, Belfast and Monaghan.  Through their personal experiences and determination, they inspired thousands of others and their campaign has been successful.People in County Donegal thought this would be the beginning of a new dawn for health care services in the county.  They thought that at last the long neglected needs of the people living in the county and region would begin to be addressed comprehensively.  However, to their horror, they have watched the debacle over the extension to Letterkenny General Hospital unravel into a farce.  The building company which was awarded the contract, McNamara Construction Limited, was closed down by NAMA, as in turn were the subcontractors who had carried out the work in the hospital.  Most importantly, the people who had waited so long for proper and adequate accident and emergency facilities and modern facilities in the wards in the floors above were let down.The aforementioned project will have been delayed by one year, but even when it comes on-stream, cutbacks in the HSE mean wards in the existing hospital building will be closed and not a single additional new bed in the three-storey building will have been created.  This constitutes a damning indictment of how health services are run.  While it is bad enough that people were obliged to wait another year, after decades of waiting for proper facilities, on its completion it will only offer a nicer environment in which to work but no new capacity.  The impact of this development is that patients are to be found on trolleys in the accident and emergency unit there on a regular basis and no doubt the position will not change when the new building finally comes on-stream.The impact of the cutbacks and the impossible budgetary demands placed on staff of the hospital results in outpatient clinics and elective surgery being cancelled regularly.  There is ongoing suspension of elective surgery.  People who are crippled with pain — mostly elderly persons — have to wait long periods for basic operations.  Consultants are paid huge salaries, yet they are sitting around twiddling their thumbs.  As they have said this publicly, they do not need me to say it.  It is ridiculous.Due to the failure to appoint junior doctors, the continuation of the 24-hour accident and emergency service at Letterkenny General Hospital is under real threat.  We await clarification as to when junior doctors will be appointed and what is envisaged as a permanent solution.  There has been a downgrading of critical services in the hospital, in comparison to hospitals serving much smaller areas.  The morale of the often heroic staff on the front line is being sapped.  They do not know what to do with themselves as a result of the pressure and the impossible demands being imposed on them by the system.The motion implores the Minister and his colleagues who campaigned for change and appealed to the real desire of the people for a new beginning after the crisis we have endured to do the right thing.  It appeals to the Minister to find the resources to honour the commitments made, not to neglect regions of the State which have been neglected for far too long.  It also appeals to him to give the people the health service they deserve and for which they pay taxes.	spk_429

The situation in Bahrain has caused great alarm to many in the medical profession in Ireland.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has refused to condemn the arrest and detention of doctors, who were not only trained and are fellows of the RCSI but served as interns in Irish hospitals.  Those doctors in Bahrain have been arrested and detained for carrying out the duties of their profession in accordance with the hippocratic oath.  It is an outrage and an insult to the medical profession across the world and yet — I can only assume this — because the RCSI and others do very serious business in Bahrain, with an investment of €60 million and hundreds of trainees and staff, the RCSI refuses to speak out against this outrage.  It spreads further, because the Sunni minority in Bahrain who rule that state in cahoots with Sunni colleagues in nearby kingdoms, which are not democracies, put together militia to keep down the democratic rights and entitlements of the Shia majority.  Not so long ago, the Shia majority in Bahrain was 70% of the population, but that has decreased to 60% because of the strategic migration of emigrants to close down that number.What is happening in Bahrain is a profound embarrassment to the Irish State.  Our President together with a former Taoiseach opened the colleges in Bahrain and we have not done enough to make it clear that what is being done in the kingdom in an insult to democrats and an outrage to doctors across the world.  I implore the Government to do much more than to ask the powers in Bahrain to do this.I will now address the issues in Palestine and Gaza.  We have a statement from the European Council that refers to the situation in Gaza, which remains of concern.  Humanitarian assistance delivered to the population in Gaza should be in accordance with the relevant framework and decisions of the UN and should take care not to endanger human lives, which is I presume a response to the flotilla which is on its way to break the naval blockade and the wider blockade.  The international community and the UN should hang their heads in shame because there have been repeated UN resolutions on the wider issue of Palestine and demands that the Israeli state immediately cease its illegal blockade and imprisonment of the Palestinian people who have to live in Gaza and endure an existence in that place.Let me read some of the statistics, of which I know the Taoiseach is aware.  I acknowledge that the Taoiseach visited the people and I am sure he must have been moved to hear the stories and see it at first hand.  More than 70% of nine month old children in Gaza are anaemic, 13.2% of the children in Gaza suffer irreversible stunted growth, 66% of households in Gaza are food insecure and 75% of the Gaza population rely on humanitarian food assistance.  That is a shocking statistic.  There are dangerous shortages of medical supplies in Gaza's hospitals and 1,500 were murdered, the vast majority of whom were innocent civilians, by the Israeli state.  Where is the consistency?  We have a UN resolution against Libya to protect the Libyan people, which is immediately enacted by NATO and the international military forces.  We have the same put to the Israeli state, where they murder and imprison those people in the state, and nothing is done to enforce the resolution.  They get away with murder.A call has been sent out to civic society internationally to assist Palestine.  The Palestinian people are a proud people and what they need is freedom, to have their dignity respected, the ability to be able to export and to have a proper existence.  Because the international community has refused to carry out its own resolutions, and has stood idly by, as tragically happened on this island at one time, we now have a situation where peace activists are imploring the international community to inspect its ships and to verify the cargo.  Some ships are carrying passengers but the vast bulk of the cargo is humanitarian aid, thousands of tonnes of it.  Our Government, the UN Secretary General and the EU, having failed to act to protect the interests of the people of Gaza, are now saying to those courageous peace activists that they cannot do anything either.  Not only will they not act, those who decide to act and put their own lives at risk are told they will not be protected.  These international bodies will not tell the Israeli state to clear the path and to permit the landing of this aid; they will not even verify the cargo on the ship to demonstrate that there are no weapons on board.What are the people of Gaza to do?  Who will help them?  Who will hold up international law against the Israeli state?  Here is the difficulty.  Ordinary people, NGOs and every human rights organisation worth its salt has said the blockade and the hijacking of boats on international waters are illegal acts.  These actions are repugnant to international law and decency but that is ignored.Irish citizens are joining courageous citizens from other nations to do the right thing by the people of Gaza.  If there is to be consistency and we are to retain international goodwill, we must ensure the resolution of this situation and ensure that the aid gets through.  The Israeli state must be confronted on its illegality and its terror once and for all.	spk_364

This should lead to a second bailout but it depends on new, brutal austerity measures getting through the Parliament.  Two laws must be passed by 30 June so that procedures will move at the euro group on 3 July.  The IMF will then release a fifth loan instalment.  If the bailout is agreed it will copper-fasten an overall proposed €120 billion loan on the Greek people.  The plan will include a sale of more than €50 billion of Greek assets, equal to one fifth of the country's annual GDP and €28 billion in cutbacks and tax increases.  Was the The Government has failed to place Ireland on the agenda at the EU Council meeting this week.  It has allowed the unravelling of the Greek situation to bury any serious consideration of the same events that are heading our way.  The issues at the council meeting this week include economic policy, migration, Croatia, the inclusion of Roma people, the endorsement of the launch of the Danube strategy, discussions on the new package and issues relating to Libya, Syria and the Middle East.  Where are we on this agenda?  The European Commission chief, Mr. Barroso, is back to pressing his influence, publicly stating yesterday that the Greek people must accept there is no alternative and that austerity and privatisation is the only way forward.  He stated that the EU and the IMF will not suffer any other programme, that everyone must take responsibility and that the EU is prepared to support Greece if Greece is prepared to follow the terms of the agreement the EU negotiated with the Greek Government.  In his typically dogmatic style, he also stated that the prospect of a deal to cut the cost of the Irish bailout was simply not up for discussion at tomorrow's EU summit.Ireland's Government accepts the EU premise that permanent austerity for Greece and Ireland is the only game in town.  There is no end in sight.  Let us consider that reparations demanded of Germany following a World War ended only this year.  Is this the type of punishing timeline we face?  Most rational and responsible commentary by economists, independent observers and media throughout the globe holds that providing second, third and fourth bailouts to countries in financial crisis cannot cover up the fact that the monetary union is fundamentally flawed and that weaker states cannot compete with the core.  Rather than face up to the situation and begin to think creatively, the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government is determined to pursue and cement the failed economic policies of the previous Government.  In its view any attempt to debate alternative proposals amounts to treason.A second, third or fourth bailout will not solve the Greek debt crisis.  Further austerity measures will only deepen the crisis.  The Greek people know this and this is why they are protesting furiously day after day, demanding that their Government reject the EU bulldozer.  They seek a viable alternative.  The only other possibility open to them is to exit the euro, return to the Greek currency and restoration of control over their national economy.  It is no coincidence that the pressure mounting for more and more bailouts comes from core EU countries, the very countries that facilitated and profited from the excess lending that contributed to these crises in the first place.  International observers agree that the faster Greece accepts the inevitability of default, the faster it will return to solvency.  Anything else simply prolongs the agony.  The Greek people know this and the Irish people know this.  Why is the Government hell-bent on walking us into the same situation?  As an article in Europe's leaders have no plan B. They see no need for it because they are still committed to plan A — the European dream of fraternity and solidarity. This must be defended at all costs, even if it means permanent austerity for Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and any other country that can't cut the mustard.Where is the Government's back up plan for what is waiting around the corner: the great taboo that no one will mention?  Will we once again be caught in the headlights, scrambling for solutions and dependent on our so-called betters in Europe to save our skins so that we can save theirs?  Is it beyond the wit of Ministers to think, consult and develop their own agenda?  Where is the creative and brave alternative?Insanity is defined as repeating the same mistake again and again.  Is this the stage we are at now?  The Government is sleepwalking the people into a delusional Shangri-La concocted by the troika in the interests of the ECB and the powerful states of Europe.  The Government should be honest with the people.  There has been enough of the window dressing and the mad chat that Europe is favouring us with loans at extortionate interest rates.  Loans must be paid back and a loan is not a gift.  Santa Claus has not come to town.  The EU and ECB are committing us to crippling debt for decades to come.In assessing the Greek situation last week, The eurozone was glued together by the convergence of low real interest rates sustaining growth, the hope that reforms could maintain convergence; and the prospect of eventual fiscal and political union.  But now convergence is gone, reform is stalled, while fiscal and political union is a distant dream.Debt restructuring will happen...But even debt reduction will not be sufficient to restore competitiveness and growth. Yet if this cannot be achieved, the option of exiting the monetary union will become dominant: the benefits of staying in will be lower than the benefits of exiting, however bumpy or disorderly that exit may end up being.Is our Government considering these questions and observations that are being expressed externally and at home or are we still covering our eyes and ears to what we simply have no wish to hear?  What is the Government's plan B?  There is none.  It amounts to debt heaped upon debt, more borrowing and digging and deepening of the hole, more of the same and no alternative in sight.  This is exactly what the Green Party and Fianna Fáil Government started in 2009 and now we are right down the same Greek path.Last week, the Minister for Finance stated that the Irish Government is in a strong position to impose losses on bondholders of two failed lenders despite strong doubts that it would permit a move so far beyond solutions being discussed for Greece expressed by the European Central Bank.  The revival for the pre-election pledge to go after senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society coincidentally occurred at the same time the Government celebrated 100 days in office.  Frankfurt has not changed its resistance to any measures to impose losses on senior bonds and the ECB could not have made this more clear.  Unfortunately the Minister's window dressing of events proved to be little more than a publicity stunt and political manoeuvring.  This begs the question: where do the Government's priorities lie.  Is it investing time and energy in saving face or committed to real action that will affect the lives of people throughout the State?  Is the Government committed to the EU or the people of this nation?  Time has more than run out.  What message are we delivering to our European partners at the EU Council this week while we watch the future of our nation being tragically played out in Greece?  Our Minister for Finance is negotiating more lending.  This used to be termed ""fiddling while Rome burned"".  Are we completely blind, completely bullied or is it a tragic combination of both?The other issues I wish to raise relate to the discussions on the Middle East.  I am sure the Taoiseach will refer to the Arab spring and the campaigns for democracy across the region.  In regard to Palestine, this State, through successive Governments, has a long and proud history of defending the Palestinian people's interests.  At various times in our history our Governments have put forward concrete, constructive solutions at international level and engaged directly with the players.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, to return to that policy and to be proactive in defending the interests of the Palestinian people.  One need only consider the reaction when the United States President, Barack Obama, talked about the need for at least a two-state solution, recognition of the Palestinian people and a state based on the 1967 borders, an entirely reasonable proposition which would see the Palestinian people having just 22% of their original lands.  That reasonable proposal was ferociously rebutted by the Prime Minister of Israel, Benyamin Netanyahu.  It was a disgraceful and outrageous rebuttal in a context where the siege of Gaza continues.  Many heroic Irish people are trying to intervene in that siege as part of the peace flotilla seeking to bring much needed resources to the people in the area.  I appeal to the Government to up its game and to lead the charge at European Union level, as the Tánaiste said he would do.  We must push forward the momentum that is required for a peaceful resolution of the crisis and the recognition of a Palestinian state.In terms of the so-called Arab spring across north Africa and the Middle East, it is important the international community is consistent in how it intervenes across the region.  We have had, and rightly so, a United Nations resolution in regard to Libya which seeks, as it was described, to protect the interests of the Libyan people and to protect them from attack by Gadaffi.  That initiative is now being turned into a drive for regime change by the French, Americans and British.  We cannot have that initiative on one hand while on the other hand we ignore the rights of people in Bahrain, Yemen and, most recently, in Syria.  There must be a consistent approach across the region.  Wherever people stand up to campaign peacefully for their democratic rights, the international community must step in assertively to defend the right to protest, assist that process and defend human rights.There is great cause for concern in the relationship some agencies in this State seem to have with the Bahraini Government.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, which has a base in Bahrain, refuses to speak out against the actions of the Bahraini Government, including the imprisonment of doctors trained and accredited by the RCSI.  It is outrageous that the college did not speak out against a situation where doctors were imprisoned for doing their job and following the hippocratic oath.  There must be consistency on this issue at European Union level and a message must go out that our interest is only in human rights and democratic rights and not the oil and resource considerations within those states."	spk_212

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-06-16	dail	31	Water and Sewerage Services: Motion	dbsect_20	I am sure people listening to or reading the report of this debate are not ignorant of this.  All of a sudden our environmental conscience, and our need to save water and allegedly to spread the revenue burden for local authorities across a wider base have been discovered at the same time that the IMF with its track record of privatisation of public utilities throughout the world arrives in Ireland.  It is shameful that our people have been squeezed to the bone — to use a water analogy they have been to the well repeatedly and now the well is dry.  There is only so much that can be squeezed from our people.As a former county councillor, I find the argument about water conservation farcical.  Every year at the annual budget meeting we looked at the issue of water charges as they were applied to businesses, farmers and community groups under the diktat of the EU.  We heard that it had to happen owing to the requirement for the user to pay and environmental concerns.  At that same meeting it was reported to us that 40% — this could have been an understatement — of the water in the county was lost owing to antiquated pipe infrastructure and no doubt this was replicated across the country.  While businesses and farmers were being squeezed to pay for water, we were losing almost half our water because of the pipe infrastructure.If we are serious about water conservation Sinn Féin believes we need investment in our pipe infrastructure.  If the IMF, EU and ECB were serious about the needs of the people and serious about environmental conservation, they would insist on an immediate investment programme in replacing our antiquated pipe system to ensure as much of our precious water is saved as possible.  Of course that is not happening and instead we are being asked to pay.  This is a three-card trick.  The Minister and others have said this money will be reinvested back into local authorities and used locally.  What will actually happen is that the money collected will go to the local authorities but the local government fund will be cut, which means the money will ultimately end up in the hands of the financial gamblers across the world who recklessly invested in this State.  So our people will be squeezed not to help the environment or strengthen the local authorities, but to pay for our good friends in the international financial institutions, who have looked after us so well in recent years.  It is a shameful episode.  We need investment in our pipe infrastructure and obviously people need to be educated in water conservation and given incentives to do so.I wish to touch on the international angle.  The very people who caused our economic crisis through their deregulation, open and free markets, and their bible of unbridled capitalism, also believe passionately in the privatisation of public resources.  Let us consider the track record of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in other parts of the world.  In return for addressing debt, they have ensured that the water resources of these people are taken over.  Veolia is doing considerable business in this country and is also doing considerable business in Israel assisting the regime there in its oppression of the Palestinian people.  Veolia, a French multinational company, has a lovely track record in Bolivia where water charges became so high that they led to social revolution.  I could elaborate for hours on the impact of the privatisation of water on poor people.  Could any fact be more disturbing than the fact that the architects of the global financial crisis, which has had an impact on working families across Europe and internationally, are the very people who are now seeking to benefit from the agenda to privatise our most precious resource with a view to ultimately implementing another part of their agenda, the privatisation of our public infrastructure?  It may start with the setting up of some quango taking control from the local authorities but this quango will ultimately be sold on, as is the plan based on the McCarthy report and others.Sinn Féin will not remain silent on this issue.  It sees the clear agenda that has been laid out by those who move the chess pieces across the board internationally.  It sees how these people have used debt to take control of vital resources across the world.  Thankfully, it also sees people fighting back across the world , particularly in Latin America.  These poor, ill-resourced people are inspirational to others globally.  Sinn Féin will join the international struggle to keep water and other vital national resources in the hands of the people, who pay taxes.During a debate on the universal social charge, we were told by the Minister of State at the Department of public expenditure and reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, that we have one of the most progressive taxation systems in the world, that we should be very proud of the State we have built, and that we should be very proud when we drive through parts of south Dublin, where there is dire poverty and wealth beyond one's wildest dreams within hundreds of yards of each other.  That the Minister of State, a Dublin man who has witnessed this disparity, can sit this Chamber and say we have one of the most progressive tax systems in the world is unacceptable.  Shame on the Government for imposing another charge, another hit, on people who are already struggling, and shame on it for implementing the agenda of international financiers, who have already squeezed our people enough.	spk_276

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-06-08	dail	31	Estimates for Public Services 2011	dbsect_19	The census process undoubtedly is of critical importance to the people and to those of us who seek change for good in society and who rely heavily on its findings in respect of unemployment rates, income levels and so on across the counties and regions of this State.  Consequently, it is a project of critical importance that is undertaken periodically.However, I am strongly of the view that the project was undermined this time.  Information has come into the public domain concerning one of the private companies that assisted the CSO with this census.  While I acknowledge it has assisted the CSO in the past, this information has only now come to light.  I refer to the private company CACI UK, which was awarded a contract worth €5.8 million to assist the CSO in a number of roles pertaining to the undertaking of the census.In respect of CACI, I refer to hundreds of torture victims from Iraq who were forced to endure Abu Ghraib and all Members are familiar with both the scandal there and the images sent around the world.  CACI, the parent company based in America, is before the United States federal courts, having been taken to court by hundreds of victims.  Moreover, their case is supported by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a group established in the 1960s by those who are campaigning for civil rights in the United States.  Members will recall those campaigns for the rights of black people in America, involving people such as Martin Luther King and many others who we celebrate here in Ireland in particular.  The aforementioned civil rights organisation is supporting the hundreds of victims who are taking a case against the very company that worked on the Irish census.  This constitutes an absolute shame on our people and the Government has ignored this because this point has been put to it.I refer to another company with which, sadly, Ireland has a relationship, called L-3 Integrated Systems, which also is being taken to court in America for its alleged involvement in acts in Iraq.  This company has aeroplanes that fly through Shannon Airport and two of which, with registration numbers N475LC and N478GS, are regular visitors to Shannon Airport.  Therefore, one must ask serious questions about the approach being taken by this State on two levels.  This concerns private companies that were involved in heinous acts and which have been taken to court both by the alleged victims and by reputable and highly respected groups that protect citizens' rights in America.	spk_355
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-06-08	dail	31	Estimates for Public Services 2011	dbsect_19	Very well, I will wrap up fairly quickly.  A critical point in this regard is that the Pentagon itself conducted an inquiry into the Abu Ghraib affair, which had a devastating impact on the Americans' efforts in Iraq at the time.  The resulting report found against CACI personnel and stated they were involved in the abuse of prisoners, had not been properly trained, had lied to investigators and were incompetent.  This information is contained in the Pentagon's own report.  I tabled a question to the Taoiseach in April on this issue and received a response from the Government and the CSO.  It stated that CACI UK Limited, which is a subsidiary of the group that allegedly is responsible for these heinous crimes, and which the United States Pentagon considers to be responsible for them, presented the best value for money.  Is this how standards now are assessed in Ireland?  Is it the case that we do not care about the reputation of a private company which gains access potentially to highly sensitive information on behalf of the people and which possibly could pass on such information to external intelligence services for whatever purpose?  Is it the case that we have no concern about the damage to our reputation caused by this?  I cannot let the motion under discussion pass without putting this on the record.	spk_357

I am sure he is aware of the growing international concern at the NATO operation.  UN Security Resolution 1973 was to prevent Gadaffi from using his army or airforce to attack Libyans.  It is clear that the international community would support those objectives particularly in the context of the Arab spring that has taken place in neighbouring countries in north Africa and is now spreading throughout the Middle East.  The Pan-African Parliament has condemned this.  The Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has expressed concern over the objectives of NATO which have moved beyond the scope of the UN resolution.  Konstantin Kosachev, spokesperson for the Duma foreign affairs committee in Russia, has expressed grave concerns at the attack which led to the killing of Muammar Gaddafi's 29 year old son and three grandchildren, which any right thinking person would have to condemn because it was an attack on the compound where they reside.Does the Tánaiste share the concerns of the Russian Parliament, the Russian Prime Minister and the Pan-African Parliament?  Does he believe there is consistency when there are numerous UN Security Council resolutions against Israel and international condemnation of Israel but no action?

I met Polisario on a number of occasions and also representatives of the Moroccan embassy.  I had made contact with the Algerian embassy in London.  It appears this conflict can be resolved with a bit of effort.  It is difficult in that the Saharawi people clearly have a right to self-determination.  Morocco, which presides over much of the land of Western Sahara, is a monarchy and is undergoing considerable reform at present.  Many of the Moroccan people who live in the northern provinces have an affinity with and roots in Western Sahara.  This region was devastated by colonialism historically by the French and Spanish who, like the British throughout the world, clearly divided and conquered and left behind a devastating legacy that lasts to the present day.I appreciate the comments and commitments of the Minister of State on this matter.  We should make whatever contribution we can based on our own departmental officials' experience of our peace process.

Konstantin Kosachev, spokesperson for the Duma foreign affairs committee in Russia, has expressed grave concerns at the attack which led to the killing of Muammar Gaddafi's 29 year old son and three grandchildren, which any right thinking person would have to condemn because it was an attack on the compound where they reside.Does the Tánaiste share the concerns of the Russian Parliament, the Russian Prime Minister and the Pan-African Parliament?  Does he believe there is consistency when there are numerous UN Security Council resolutions against Israel and international condemnation of Israel but no action?  When Irish citizens try to go on a flotilla bringing international aid they are advised not to as they are not supported by the Government.  Where is the consistency in approach?  Where is the NATO operation against Israel to enforce those resolutions?  This is the issue for the international community.	spk_267

I met Polisario on a number of occasions and also representatives of the Moroccan embassy.  I had made contact with the Algerian embassy in London.  It appears this conflict can be resolved with a bit of effort.  It is difficult in that the Saharawi people clearly have a right to self-determination.  Morocco, which presides over much of the land of Western Sahara, is a monarchy and is undergoing considerable reform at present.  Many of the Moroccan people who live in the northern provinces have an affinity with and roots in Western Sahara.  This region was devastated by colonialism historically by the French and Spanish who, like the British throughout the world, clearly divided and conquered and left behind a devastating legacy that lasts to the present day.I appreciate the comments and commitments of the Minister of State on this matter.  We should make whatever contribution we can based on our own departmental officials' experience of our peace process.  I will be happy to give whatever humble assistance I can and engage with the various protagonists.  In fairness to the Department of Foreign Affairs, it is much more eminently qualified than I am and has many more resources and contacts than I do.  The conflict can be resolved with focused effort.  We need to address the human rights concerns.  I ask the Minister of State to utilise whatever resources are available to reach a conclusion.	spk_274
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-06-02	dail	31	Foreign Conflicts	dbsect_18	I agree with Deputy Ó Fearghaíl.  I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to engage in talks on the Israeli-Palestinian crisis and I welcome his raising the matter with the President of the United States when he was here.  There is much cynicism about international travel but we can make no apologies for it if it concerns international aid.  We must have the full support of the House in terms of the Minister of State engaging proactively in trade missions and furthering Ireland's fantastic role.  Ireland has had a great track record in international affairs and interventions having learned from its own experience of conflict.  It has used its respect and standing in this regard positively.There have been attacks on Ireland's reputation recently, and we began this session talking about them.  Ireland's reputation with regard to conflict resolution and human rights is second to none.  Ireland has had wonderful civil servants over the years.  I urge the Minister of State to lead from the front using recent experience of Ireland's own conflict and others.  She will have the full support of Members on this side of the House when travelling as much as she can throughout the world to promote the aforementioned message and when engaging in trade missions.	spk_280

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-05-18	dail	31	Dublin and Monaghan Bombings: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_29	I welcome the commitment made yesterday by An Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, arising from the tabling of this motion and the questions from us and others, that he will raise this matter directly with the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, when he meets with him today.  I look forward to the Taoiseach reporting back to the Dáil on what the British Prime Minister has to say in response.  The motion before us, which was proposed by Sinn Féin and unanimously endorsed by the House, reinforces the motion passed in July 2008 and thus gives him a full mandate to ask the British Government to do the right thing.  It has been repeatedly been asked to do the right thing but has failed to do so.  The British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, was reported in the media as citing the supposed legal obstacles and constraints the European Court of Human Rights presents to releasing these files.  We do not accept this argument and we expect that Taoiseach will reject the attempt at further procrastination.The Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974, with their devastating impact, were preceded and succeeded by incidents in which the British state played a direct role in co-ordinating loyalist paramilitaries in the murder of Irish citizens.  I will focus on an incident that occurred 20 years ago next Wednesday, 25 May, namely, the assassination of Eddie Fullerton, a Sinn Féin councillor, in my hometown of Buncrana.  Eddie Fullerton was an elected representative on Buncrana Town Council and Donegal County Council.  It is clear when one examines the circumstances of Eddie's assassination that the British state, because it got away in 1974 with co-ordinating the deeds of loyalist paramilitaries who acted in cahoots with British military intelligence, continued to act in this fashion throughout the shoot-to-kill era and the collusion of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Sinn Féin councillors and members, human rights lawyers, GAA officials and innocent civilians were murdered as part of a systematic campaign.  Before that, British military intelligence armed these paramilitaries to the teeth with weapons from South Africa through their conduit, Brian Nelson.  It is an horrific story.One Deputy, who has since left the Chamber, referred to the actions of Irish republicans in the conflict.  The difference is that Irish republicans have accepted responsibility for their role in the conflict and have apologised to innocent victims.  The British state has never done that.  It has never been open or honest about its role in the conflict, whether direct or indirect.  In particular, the withholding of its files denies justice to the families of the victims in Dublin and Monaghan on that day in 1974.I raise the case of Eddie Fullerton not to distract from the focus of this motion but to embolden and strengthen the families by pointing out that the failure of our Government to hold the British Government to account allowed the continued killing of people in this State.  Eddie Fullerton lived in a cul-de-sac in Cockhill Park, a small council estate located one mile from Buncrana town.  The amount of intelligence required in that assassination or murder was considerable and could not have been collected solely by loyalist paramilitaries.  The killers were able to take over a house located one mile from Eddie's home, kidnap the daughter of the family and use the family car and a sledge-hammer belonging to the man of the house to carry out their operation.  A second car monitored Eddie's house and when he returned home, two different cars were parked nearby.  They knew enough to come around the back of gardens and to use the sledge-hammer on his front door.  More importantly, they were familiar with the complex layout of Eddie's house, which had a number of extensions.  They made their way immediately to Eddie's door.  Eddie fought them at the door and tried to defend his wife but was murdered in a calculated and systematic fashion.  The people involved clearly had the benefit of considerable intelligence and military experience.  This means the British state, probably directed from No. 10 through its intelligence services, ordered the assassination of an elected representative of the people of County Donegal in this Twenty-six Counties State.The weapons used to kill the nine victims of the 1993 Greysteel massacre and the four workers at Castlerock where revealed by ballistic evidence to have been used in Eddie's killing.  That evidence was already available in 1993 but, incredibly, the Garda did not think it necessary to question the people charged and convicted for those murders.  This evidence was discovered by Eddie's immediate family.  For the past 20 years, an entire generation of his family has had to campaign for justice when the facts are staring us in the face.  I could say more about this case because it emboldens the families of the Dublin and Monaghan victims.  Their experience was visited on others over the past 37 years because our Government failed to hold the British Government to account.  If it can get away with the murder of so many people, clearly it will not give a thought to the murder of a public representative.Irish republicans are part of a positive dynamic.  Across this island, 400,000 people support our party and we are moving forward with confidence towards the achievement of a united Ireland.  We have stood up to our responsibilities as Irish republicans and we are building relationships.  The British state has not done the same and that is our key contention when its Head of State, the Queen of England, comes here on the anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the week before the 20th anniversary of Eddie's killing.  It is long overdue that the British state, in the guise of either its Queen or its Prime Minister, accepted responsibility for its role in this conflict and its indirect or direct contribution to the deaths of hundreds of Irish people.  Let nobody lecture Irish republicans on moving on and not looking back.  Those who lecture us never met their responsibilities.  They abandoned the families of their own citizens and elected representatives.  These families had to become the investigating body on behalf of the Irish people.  That is the biggest disservice to the families who are in the Gallery and the relatives of Eddie Fullerton and others.  They have had to do the job of the Garda in the absence of an investigation.  That is a damning indictment of the Twenty-six Counties State and successive Governments.  They should not lecture us when they failed to meet their responsibilities to their own citizens.When the Taoiseach meets David Cameron and gets over the diplomatic niceties, he needs to represent the collective voice of the 166 Members of this House and of the Irish people by telling the British Government to accept its responsibility for arming loyalists to the teeth and directing them to the homes of victims, and for the direct involvement of its forces in those murders.  It must take responsibility for the part it played in the conflict.  Irish republicans have stepped up to the plate and it is time for others to do likewise.  That is what moving forward is about.  That is maturity, that is a state which deals with the legacy of conflict.	spk_369
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-05-17	dail	31	Report of the Standing Order 103 Select Committee: Motion	dbsect_19	As the Sinn Féin representative on the Standing Order 103 Select Committee, I am happy to commend the motion to the House.  It was passed unanimously by the committee after much deliberation.  It reflects a united determination not only among the members of the committee but I am sure the Members of this House also to defend one of the few instruments we have available to affect economic policy to create jobs and attract inward investment.I am conscious that, opportunistically, some of our European partners, for want of a better description these days, have sought to use the proposal as a negotiating ploy in response to the ongoing attempts by Ireland to get a better deal and move away from the EU-IMF austerity programme which is devastating the economy and our people.The scope for manoeuvre by the committee was limited and within the context of subsidiarity.  One could apply it in purely technical and legalistic terms, but I note from looking at the responses of some of the other parliaments, in particular the Dutch and British Parliaments, that they clearly associate sovereignty with subsidiarity.  It is very important for us to do so also, since so much of our economic sovereignty has been taken away.  That was a key focus for us.  It is important to state how the British Minister presented the issue in the debate in the British Parliament which issued a reasoned opinion similar to that of the Dutch Parliament.  It is important for the public to understand its implications.  It stated:The draft Directive would:provide for a single set of harmonised rules for calculating the tax base for taxable profits of companies resident in Member States;allow companies to opt into the CCCTB or to continue to operate within national tax systems;allow groups of companies to calculate their total EU-wide consolidated profit for tax purposes;provide for that profit to be allocated to companies making up the group on the basis of an apportionment formula composed of sales, payroll, number of employees and assets in each Member State; andprovide that Member States would then tax the profit apportioned to companies in their Member State.To simplify the matter, we could retain our corporation tax rate at the current level, but if this proposal was applied throughout the European Union, much of the profits made by companies based here would be redistributed to other member states.  Reports carried out on behalf of the Department of Finance demonstrate that the economy and the people would clearly lose out as a result of this proposal.The quantitative and qualitative aspects of the proposal were picked up on by the committee.  The reports emanating from the European Commission to advance the proposal were poor in comparison to those the Department had prepared.  They failed to adequately demonstrate the mutual benefits of the proposal across all member states.  The committee in its deliberations and recommendation to the House strongly referred to this aspect, which was alarming.It has been on the agenda of some member states to go after sovereignty, look for harmonisation and pull us into a one-size-fits-all policy.  We see from what has been happening to the euro and the European economy how dangerous that could be.  I refer to the comments and concerns of the Dutch Parliament in this regard.  We have concluded our deliberations, but the Dutch and British were stronger in their reasoned opinions.  They did not focus only on the issue of subsidiarity, they also spoke about proportionality — two headings under which we must assess European Union legislation.  The Dutch state the proposal does not adequately indicate that action at EU level is preferable to the current situation where member states act individually; the proposal would not be beneficial to all stakeholders; the impact assessment clearly sets out many disadvantages for individual states which require comparison against the proposed benefits; the proposal might only have a very small positive impact on the general well-being of the European Union as a whole but would have a negative impact on the GDP and well-being of some countries, including the Netherlands; the proposal could cause budgetary losses at national level because of a smaller tax base; the proposal is badly timed in the current economic climate; and that in accepting that the impact on the revenue of individual member states would depend on their mix of taxation and policy choices, the Commission is indirectly interfering in the field of direct tax rates.  Again, they are concerned about the sovereignty issue.  The Dutch House of Representatives recommends caution for reasons of practicality and principle and refers to proposals that encroach on national sovereignty.  I could quote from the reasoned opinion of the British Parliament at length, but it is broadly along the same lines.  There is concern, therefore, and not only in small member states on the issue of sovereignty.The position may have changed since it reported to us at the committee, but I was concerned about the Department of Finance's initial advice to us.  It advised initially, on a preliminary basis, that the proposal complied with the principle of subsidiarity.  I am mindful of the fact that in 2007 it stated the CCCTB proposal cut across national sovereignty and subsidiarity.  That was the strong link it made to the sovereignty theme.  However, it advised the committee on a preliminary basis of this.  I am not satisfied the response given to us shows a change of opinion over such a short period of time and on such an important matter.When campaigning against the Lisbon treaty, Sinn Féin and many others outlined that the Irish State and other member states retain the veto over corporation tax.  The difficulty was that under qualified majority voting and other mechanisms, particularly enhanced co-operation, there is potential for enhanced co-operation even when a number of states have vetoes, reasoned opinions and the yellow card system at the European level.  A number of European states can move on this, meaning there will be significant difficulties for Ireland if the member states happen to be France, Germany and Italy.  Products manufactured here are exported for sale into those economies.  We need to be vigilant.There have been repeated German and French calls in recent times for a The requirements to have control over corporation tax is a key instrument of Government.  We have lost so many and conceded so many to our cost.  We cannot concede another one.  We must remain vigilant about the idea of enhanced co-operation and the ability of other states to undermine, by the back door, the will of the Irish, the Dutch, the British and the Polish people.  We must be vigilant and focus on this point.I am concerned about the preliminary advice of the Department of Finance.  Maybe it has changed since it gave it to us but it is concerning, even if it was given on a preliminary basis.  These are the very people who were accused by Morgan Kelly of doing a poor job of negotiating on our behalf with the ECB.  These are the people who Morgan Kelly accused of suffering from Stockholm syndrome during negotiations, which will have major implications for people.  We need to ensure that on this issue, they are defending this national interest.  I was disappointed with the preliminary advice, even if it is limited to the tight, technical constraints of subsidiarity.Fine Gael and Labour MEPs supported the Bersani report at European level but I am pleased to see that, in this Parliament, they have moved away from that position.  They see the danger of what began at that level.  We need to be vigilant and we need to monitor the situation.  We have taken the first steps and I am sure the House will endorse the recommendation of the committee.  This will send the collective message to European policymakers.  I am sure other parliaments will do the same.  Let there be no doubt that this is not the end of the process.  There is a long journey to run.	spk_253

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-05-09	dail	31	Oireachtas Europe Day: Statements	dbsect_2	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important debate.  I also echo the welcome extended this morning to Ireland's European Commissioner, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn and our MEPs.  I welcome in particular to the Oireachtas my party colleague, Bairbre de Brún, MEP, in further evidence of the all-Ireland nature of Sinn Féin's political project.Members are convened to discuss Europe Day, the official EU celebration of the Schuman declaration presented on 9 May 1950.  According to the invitation issued by the Ceann Comhairle, Members have been asked to discuss where they believe Europe will be in 2020 and whether the EU's latest economic strategy, Europe 2020, can lead us to a smart, sustainable and inclusive future.  There is a certain irony that this debate comes after a weekend of intense speculation on the ongoing crisis of the eurozone and a discussion, provoked by economist Morgan Kelly, on the origins and impacts of and alternatives to the EU-ECB-IMF austerity programme supported by the present Government.Before addressing these important matters, I will first remind the house of Sinn Féin's general approach to the politics of the EU.  Sinn Féin is proud to be a euro-critical party.  While it believes Ireland's place is at the heart of Europe, it also believes it is the responsibility of Government and Opposition to play a full part in EU affairs and to this end, Sinn Féin has long advocated greater attention to EU affairs in public and Oireachtas debates.  However, what marks out Sinn Féin as distinct from the other major political parties in this House is that while we support those aspects of European Union policy that are in the interests of the people of Ireland, we are not afraid to oppose those policies which we believe are bad for Ireland.  We do not believe that opposition to aspects of the EU project, whether in the form of directives, Council decisions or treaties, makes us anti-European.  Indeed, Sinn Féin argues that when it critically opposes aspects of EU policy, it is on the grounds that these policies are bad for both Ireland and the EU as a whole.Sinn Féin's opposition to the Lisbon treaty in 2008 and 2009 and to the EU-ECB-IMF austerity programme, whether in its Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael-Labour versions, is informed by this approach.  Unfortunately, as evidenced by comments attributed to Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn in On those issues, there is no doubt that the European integration project is in crisis.  The crisis of the euro, the growing debt crisis across all EU member states and the failure of the European Council, European Commission and European Central Bank to respond effectively to these problems are all evidence of a project faltering under the weight of problems it helped create and, therefore, is unable to resolve.Contrary to the views expressed by Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn last week, membership of the euro did not save the country from the worst excesses of recession in 2008 and 2009.  Rather, euro membership and the Stability and Growth Pact, along with the failed policies of the Fianna Fáil Party, the party to which Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn belongs, contributed to the collapse of the Irish and European economies.  While Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn's party colleagues were busy driving the Irish economy into a massive debt-fuelled property bubble at home, across in Brussels her colleagues at the European Commission were busy implementing a neo-liberal economic policy agenda that facilitated the debt-fuelled boom and bust cycle of recent years.  They were ably assisted by the ECB, the monetary policy of which further fuelled the casino economics of the boom.  Yet we are supposed to believe that the very politicians and policies, both domestic and European, that caused our economic collapse are somehow best placed to get us out of the mess they created.  Worse still, we are being asked to cede even more power over economic and monetary policy to the European Commission and the ECB when what is required is to return control over these key areas of policy to this House, which is the true democratic representative of the people.What kind of fools does the Government take us for?  Does anybody believe that the massive bank bailouts and deep austerity measures in the troika's programme and supported by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party will help the Irish economy on the road to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth as demanded by the Europe 2020 strategy?  Does anybody believe that saddling this State with a sovereign debt of €250 billion by 2014, a shocking debt of €120,000 per worker, will help create employment and reduce poverty?  If newspaper reports are to be believed, the senior politicians and officials that met in secret in Luxembourg on Friday night no longer believe in the ability of their own policies to resolve the crisis of the eurozone.The only way for Ireland and the EU to get out of the multiple social and economic crises that we currently face is to take a radical change of direction.  This will not come from the Irish or European politicians who created the crisis.  During this week's debate on the jobs initiative, my colleagues in Sinn Féin and I will outline our alternative to the failed policies of the Fine Gael-Labour Government, the European Commission and the ECB.  Our alternative will not only get the Irish economy back on track, but in doing so will contribute to an EU-wide economic and social recovery.Those who care about the European project and Europe's potential to continue as a positive contributor to progressive social policies and a real gathering of the people from among the people on the ground must be devastated by the damage done to the project by the decision of the ECB, supported by the European political elites, to cripple the Irish for a crisis that was not solely our responsibility.  It is clear that the ECB fuelled this crisis from the core European states to the peripheral ones.  As evidenced in Mr. Morgan Kelly's article, the ECB has forced the Irish to take full responsibility.  This fundamentally undermines the European project and the claims of solidarity and European partnership.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, those in government and the Commissioner to work with the Tánaiste concerning the diplomatic initiative he announced, in which he discussed joining European partners.  I have called on him to speak with the 186 other member states of the IMF and to have an investigation into how the IMF and the ECB managed to allow this massive private institution casino in Ireland, backed by the ECB and international financiers, and saddled the Irish with a level of debt that will cripple our potential.	spk_16

The European project has considerable potential.  Sinn Féin is not a party of little islanders.  We believe in internationalism and international solidarity.  We must stand up for the interests of ordinary people in Ireland, Greece, Portugal and the peripheral states.  Those on either side of the European debate know that what is happening is a profound injustice, wrong and damaging the European project, not in terms of Europe itself, but internationally.  This is my appeal.	spk_18

It is ironic because the farming community is constantly harassed about its responsibilities to wildlife, habitats and special areas of conservation by enthusiastic people with clipboards, yet this situation of widespread devastation could have been avoided with better approaches.  One such approach is related to the destocking of commonage that started in 1998.  The real experts on the environment in rural areas are our farmers.  Wherever there was stocking on land, wherever grazing had not been taking place, the impact was much less.  Wherever there was a shortage of stock, it was more profound.  That is a key issue.  I know it is not the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, but I would like him to speak to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to see if this can be reviewed.I join Deputy Doherty in commending the heroic actions of our firemen throughout the State, of the Defence Forces and, most importantly, local volunteers who would not have the skills required to do this job.  The enthusiasm and the determination to assist was clear throughout Donegal and across the State.There are also examples in some parts of the State of approaches taken by the emergency services that seemed to be more successful than approaches taken in other parts.  There needs to be a complete review by the relevant Departments of lessons learned from this.  Another point made is the impact of the frost, which created the circumstances that allowed the exceptional amount of gorse fires to continue.I endorse Deputy Doherty's call for a co-ordinated emergency response to be deployed to situations like these in the future, and to pre-empt them as much as possible.  We also need to deploy the same resources to the floods and to the frost.  As a county councillor at the time, I have to say we were deeply disappointed with the approach of the previous Government to the crisis in the freezing temperatures.  It was very slow and it took weeks to get off the ground.  It is important that this Government does not repeat those mistakes.  It has failed in its first test to co-ordinate the response nationally, and if it was not for local authorities, local firemen and local communities, this would have been much worse.  It needs to be dealt with in an authoritative fashion.  The Minister and his colleagues in the relevant Departments should sort this out.  I think they should send a letter of congratulations on behalf of the Government to the local authorities and fire services, thanking them for their heroic efforts and reassuring them that they will have the supports necessary to do their job, including water tankers for the fire services.

The 1.5 million people of Gaza are living in an open-air prison.  The international community has stood idly by, with the exception of some honourable people in the NGOs and the United Nations.  The people of Gaza have been abandoned to a regime that borders on international terrorism in that Israel is almost a rogue state — that is the reality.  Peace activists from around the world, in the absence of actions by their Governments, are trying to bring in vital assistance to these people in an inspirational fashion, despite ten of those activists being murdered in the last effort.Despite that action, there has been a failure of the international community to respond and to be consistent in its approach to states that behave in this fashion.  As Governments will not intervene, there is now a scenario whereby good peace activists, who try to do their bit peacefully, are prevented from doing so.  What hope do they have if some Governments, first, will not stand up and condemn Israel solely for its actions, second, will not intervene in any shape or form, and, third, advise those good peace activists who want to do something about this that they should not intervene?  They have been utterly abandoned.How is it we cannot assist the beleaguered, imprisoned people of Gaza in some way?  What hope can we give them?  What leadership can be given by the Irish Government, which is respected internationally in regard to human rights?  We must deal with this issue.	spk_261

The 1.5 million people of Gaza are living in an open-air prison.  The international community has stood idly by, with the exception of some honourable people in the NGOs and the United Nations.  The people of Gaza have been abandoned to a regime that borders on international terrorism in that Israel is almost a rogue state — that is the reality.  Peace activists from around the world, in the absence of actions by their Governments, are trying to bring in vital assistance to these people in an inspirational fashion, despite ten of those activists being murdered in the last effort.Despite that action, there has been a failure of the international community to respond and to be consistent in its approach to states that behave in this fashion.  As Governments will not intervene, there is now a scenario whereby good peace activists, who try to do their bit peacefully, are prevented from doing so.  What hope do they have if some Governments, first, will not stand up and condemn Israel solely for its actions, second, will not intervene in any shape or form, and, third, advise those good peace activists who want to do something about this that they should not intervene?  They have been utterly abandoned.How is it we cannot assist the beleaguered, imprisoned people of Gaza in some way?  What hope can we give them?  What leadership can be given by the Irish Government, which is respected internationally in regard to human rights?  We must deal with this issue.	spk_261

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-04-20	dail	31	Commission of Inquiry into Banking Sector: Statements	dbsect_29	"The Nyberg report published yesterday places the blame for Ireland's financial crisis squarely in the hands of Ireland's troika of incompetence, that is, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance. Regulation was weak, banks were greedy, profit was king, the media were complicit and so on. While the Nyberg report places blame on the Irish players for the economic catastrophe, one glaring omission as a result of the limited terms of reference is an acknowledgement of the central role played by the IMF, the ECB and some of our stronger European partners in getting us into this sorry state. The ECB and French and German banks, in particular, were only too willing to funnel endless streams of cheap money into the Irish banks which are now insolvent. Is it not ironic that these are the same countries that seek the amendment of our corporation tax rates? The funds of those European bondholders are now guaranteed by Irish taxpayers who must pay for the sins, both of our reckless bankers and of the ECB and European bankers.I refer to an interesting statistic, albeit dreadful for Ireland, pertaining to German and French banks. Although such banks hold €10 billion of Ireland's sovereign debt, they hold €74.5 billion of Irish bank debt. If one joins up the dots, this tells one that those vested interests, namely, the German and French states in defence of their banks, are determined to bail out the banks to save their own bacon. Consequently, this is not a bailout for the Irish people. It is as much a bailout for the European banking system as it is for us and for German and French banks, in particular. This is a European problem and reflects a structural imbalance between the core and the periphery. A total of 1.8 million Irish taxpayers simply cannot afford to pay the creditors of private European banks which lent recklessly to Irish banks, thereby accumulating more than €150 billion in debt.An important point to note is that the Government has done nothing to stop the false narrative that is developing and spreading like wildfire across Europe to the effect that Ireland alone is responsible for its economic breakdown and crisis. It was interesting to observe the recent Finnish general election in which a party made gains based on a belief the Finnish people were contributing towards bailouts that only benefited other countries. This is part of the myth and the Government must make it clear this is a bigger issue which pertains as much to a European as to an Irish failure of the banking systems.I now turn to the other troika of incompetence, namely, the European Central Bank, the IMF and some of our stronger European partners. The ECB, the European Union and international money markets must be exposed for their share in creating the crisis. The report examines the Irish Financial Regulator and Irish Central Bank but what about the European regulators and the European Central Bank? One of Dr. Nyberg's key conclusions or reasons for the bubble is the flood of cheap funding from the wholesale money markets given Let us be clear about what was being done to people across the State. Pages 5 and 6 of the Regling and Watson report on macroeconomic developments in the State which was published last June stated when referring to the IMF's analysis of the Irish financial sector and system: ""Equally, the IMF was not strongly or consistently critical of the underlying dynamics of fiscal policy"". It also stated: ""The IMF's major Financial System Stability Assessment of 2006 did not sound the alarm, and there is no evidence that its private warnings did so either"". The said IMF 2006 assessment which Messrs Regling and Watson are condemning claimed that the Irish financial sector had continued to perform well since its participation in the financial sector assessment programme, FSAP, in 2000 and that financial soundness and market indicators were generally strong. This was the international culture at the time. It even went on to state the outlook for the financial system was positive and that good progress had been achieved in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework in line with the recommendations of the 2000 FSAP. As the Nyberg report spells out, ""International organisations (IMF, EU, and OECD) were, at most, modestly critical and often complimentary regarding Irish developments and institutions. This gave the authorities and the banks additional reason to assume that all really was well"". Clearly, the role of the International Monetary Fund and particularly the ECB needs further examination. While the Government, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator were blind and indifferent to what was going on, the ECB and the IMF which are supposed to monitor European and world economies and ensure financial stability did not see any cause for alarm.I am sure that, like every Deputy, I was researching reports and reading some stories on-line last night. I read something written by Mr. Nick Leeson, the man who brought down Barings Bank many years ago, on What changes are under way within both organisations to prevent this problem recurring? Can their reports and analyses be taken seriously? If the euro collapses, as some commentators claim is now possible — I hope they are wrong — what credence does the ECB have? How is it any different from the regulators, central banks and governments which failed to predict and prevent this crisis?During Private Members' business last night on the motion on oil and gas fiscal licensing terms the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, stated:The 2007 tax terms do not apply to the Corrib gas field, as they do not apply to exploration licences granted prior to 2007. To do so would have been to introduce what would, in effect, have been a retrospective form of taxation and such an action would not have been in Ireland's interest.I hope these comments will not be characteristic of the Government's approach to what clearly are injustices. If something is wrong, it should be righted no matter what it is. I wonder what the Minister meant by ""would not have been in Ireland's interest.""Significant responsibility and blame lie with those controlling the purse strings and delivering financial advice at EU and IMF level, those who promoted the very deregulation and liberalisation of the domestic and international financial regimes that created the crash and those politicians and figures who introduced waves of tax incentives for people to invest in financial speculation rather than the real economy.I put it to the Government that all three reports to date — the Regling and Watson, Honohan and Nyberg reports — have referred to the international dimension of negligence. On that point, will the Tánaiste who is undertaking a diplomatic initiative extend the remit of his European diplomatic mission with a new objective, namely, to communicate this crucial point to the Independent Evaluation Office, established in 2001 as an internal watchdog for the IMF, and also appeal to the 186 other member governments of the IMF to review its complete failure in operating successfully in the case of the State? The Government's members are now Ministers. They are in charge of the country's future. They should give young people a reason to stay and fight for their futures."	spk_355

I was sitting in my office listening to the debate — as do all Deputies — to keep in touch with the debate before the time for my contribution. A Labour Party Deputy referred to this motion as a leprechaun motion. He spoke about black shoes and golden buckles and so on. He reminded me of Bertie Ahern when he was in my county of Donegal when he was challenged on the wisdom of the economic crisis and he referred to suicide. Now, Bertie Ahern is rightly damned. My warning to Government Deputies, in their arrogance and with their huge majority, is to very careful about statements like that at this time as they could come back to bite them on the backside at some stage in the future.I will e-mail a copy of this report from the Centre for Public Inquiry entitled, The Great Corrib Gas Controversy, to all Labour and Fine Gael Deputies. I challenge them to read it. It is a damning indictment of Government policy over the years. It is a very comprehensive report. The Centre for Public Inquiry was taken out by the political establishment, working with the media establishment, in order to block it from getting under the skin of what we all now know led to this economic catastrophe. There are very serious lessons for Labour Party Deputies in particular who would share many of our values. They should not come into the House to refer to a leprechaun motion. It is clear that the Government moved away from what were shaping up to be very good policies in the 1970s to set up a State oil and gas company to implement the promise of the 1916 Proclamation and the words of James Fintan Lalor and to start to do something right by the people. At one stage, the Norwegian Government was going to assist in that process. Somehow we moved from that approach in the 1970s through to Ray Burke's giveaway, his selling out show, to Bertie Ahern's continuation of that policy.This was the agenda to the point that compulsory purchase orders were given in the interests of private companies. Compulsory purchase orders are meant to be used in the public interest, where private land is subservient to the public interest. Here was a compulsory purchase order introduced in the interests of private companies in order to make a profit in this country. We then wonder how we ended up in this economic mess with that type of culture. This was the prevailing culture. I do not need to remind the Deputies in this House of Ray Burke as he sat on the other side of the Chamber and gave all the assurances and how his political legacy now reads. This is the man who stood over the transition from the possibility of a State company to a wholesale selling of our resources. It ended with five, decent, honourable, salt of the earth men being locked up in jail for standing up for their rights. They were vindicated eventually by An Bord Pleanála. This is not leprechaun politics; this is a Sinn Féin party with an enhanced strength standing up for the interests of the communities we represent.I was privileged to go down to west Mayo. I was ashamed to see private security officers and gardaí facilitating the destruction of a beach to allow a pipeline to be laid by a private company. Some of those security personnel have had interesting journeys in their lives since then. That is what we have. It is a shame and a scandal. It is part of the culture that led us to economic catastrophe. It was remarkable to hear the new Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, speaking last night. With the arrogance of his Government's big majority, he said it would be wrong to change retrospectively the tax arrangements that are in place for Shell. He asked what message it would send to international investors. If that is the approach of those trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU and the IMF — God help Ireland if it is — what chance do we have?	spk_443

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-04-13	dail	31	European Council: Statements	dbsect_9	"Following the EU Council's summit meeting last week, the European Commission Secretary General, Catherine Day, called the Irish bailout ""tough but sustainable"".  For the Irish taxpayer and Ireland's future generations, there is nothing sustainable about the figures announced on Monday by the IMF, which included a predicted drop in growth rate from 0.9% to 0.5%, among the lowest of any country in the developed world, and further increases in unemployment.What is clear, though, from these new figures and from the results of the recent stress tests, is that Ireland will never be able to sustain the EU-IMF loan.  As the Nobel Prize-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, pointed out in Even in more optimistic scenarios, Ireland's debt to GDP ratio is expected to soar to 125 per cent in 2013, up from 25% in 2007.  Low growth could make things worse, as stagnant GDP offsets the reduction in Ireland's debt.  If Europe continues to falter — 2011 growth is projected to be lower even than last year — this will make recovery all the more difficult.He went on to point out that the question of which policies are right is being distorted by an effort to save the banks and in the article also stated:Even the EU is now anticipating that projections made just a short while ago were too rosy.  But the EU recipe for recovery is more of the same: to meet the deficit reduction targets, more austerity — which in turn means still lower growth and still higher unemployment.It does not take an economic genius to figure out where all this will inevitably lead.  It creates a perverse cycle where austerity kills growth and that in turn causes revenue to fall.  The fall in revenue then adds to the deficits and creates a demand for even more funding and more austerity.  It is a perfect example of the self-fulfilling prophecy.The words of Stiglitz will come as no surprise to Irish taxpayers who have had to witness billions upon billions of their money being pumped into a bottomless black hole.  The EU, the IMF, and our Government all call this a ""bailout"".  But the truth is that the only people being bailed out are the protected bondholders.  This sentiment is being echoed by prominent European and international organisations, such as the European Trade Union Institute, ETUI, the European Trade Union Confederation, ETUC and the International Labour Organisation, ILO, which have also stated that a prolonged process of austerity in the absence of a co-ordinated public investment plan from Europe can only depress the Irish economy further.  This downward spiral will only be halted by a redirection of priorities, away from the saving of banks and toward the creation of jobs and economic growth.Sinn Féin has consistently called for the investment of the resources in the National Pensions Reserve Fund into a concentrated programme for job creation.  The previous Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government decided to pump those assets into the failing banks, and the current Government is now following suit.  Sinn Féin believes we must exploit our resources for the national good, for our economy, our industry and our people.  In stark contrast, both the current Government and its immediate predecessors have chosen to sell them off.  Where is the vision?  Where is the hope for future generations when our Tánaiste signs his consent to the Corrib pipeline because he believes it meets all the preconditions, yet his party criticised the former Minister, former Deputy Pat Carey, for issuing the consent on the day of the election?Instead of protecting our resources and challenging their being auctioned off, which we are witnessing, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has limply regurgitated the same briefings from the Department that were issued by previous Ministers.  Rather than do what is right by the people, this Fine Gael and Labour Party Government prefers to follow a road map that will secure the assets not of this country or its people but of European banks and their bondholders.  Rather than opening up their minds to consider real alternatives that have been put forward not just by our party but also by Independent Deputies, national and international economists, Nobel Prize winners and international and European labour organisations, this Government prefers to commit the Irish people to following a flawed plan forced on them by the EU and IMF.What is that plan?  It amounts to nothing more than inflicting massive pain and suffering on ordinary people in order to pay off monstrous debts incurred by reckless banks at extortionate rates from our European partners and the IMF.  How can a country with a population of 4.4 million, and a working population of less than half that number, cope with a debt that is escalating by the billions at what appears to be a weekly rate?  It is lunacy.The ETUC has already sent clear warning signals to European institutions about its concern for the way the EU and the IMF are tackling the Irish, Greek and Portuguese crises.  It stated that some measures in the recent economic governance package touch upon industrial relations and taxation.  It is clear that the real aim of including these measures in the package is to reduce the wages and living standards of ordinary people across Europe, rather than to strengthen the regulation of European banks and financial markets.  Reckless lending and reckless gambling by these speculators is what fuelled the financial crisis across Europe.  Ireland is not alone.  Unfortunately, many more of our European partners will soon be sharing our misery.The EU is leading this Fine Gael and Labour Party Government by the nose into an exploding economic depression.  The policies it is following amount to little more than further deregulation of labour markets, wage cuts, tax increases and reductions in Government spending.  Elite policy makers across the EU are responsible for the eurozone debt crisis and it is time we confronted them and told them so.  The IMF and ECB are demanding that Irish citizens bear the burden of the mistakes made by international financial wizards.  We are being told that we must socialise the losses, while the gains can continue to be privatised.Again, Ireland is not alone in this mess.  We have plenty of company now.  Ireland's problem is a European problem and it reflects a stark structural imbalance between the core and the periphery.  The countries on the periphery of Europe — Ireland, Greece, Portugal and perhaps more to follow — are caught up in a European financial storm.  Where is the solidarity from our large core European partners such as Germany and France?  They have placed a savage and unbearable burden on our people — a burden that should have been shared because the responsibility for the crisis lies with Europe as much as Ireland.  They have kicked us while we are down and they have torn the stated objectives of the European project into tatters.International opinion is clear.  Respected observers are looking in amazement at how we have been abandoned and punished.  The European Council meeting is the core policy making centre of Europe; above all the institutions, it is where the strategic direction is decided.  We have an unprecedented economic crisis and it was not even raised, according to what the Taoiseach said.  It was not even on the agenda for that core summit Council meeting.  That is wrong.  We must change tack.  I appeal to the Government to stand up against this injustice, to invoke the spirit of those honourable men and women who sacrificed so much so we would have the honour of serving in this House, to immediately engage in a robust diplomatic initiative against this patent injustice and to seek realistic and genuinely sustainable terms for our people.

Fianna Fáil's ruinous plan to shove nearly half the nation's GDP into the vaults of the nation's failed banks has now been accepted by the Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition as the only game in town.  They lied to the people in the run-up to the election.  Fine Gael and Labour know it.  They won an endorsement from the electorate on the grounds that they would renegotiate the terms of the deal with the EU and the IMF and would insist on bondholders sharing the burden of the deficit.  Little more than a month after the election, it is clear that they completely and deliberately misled the people.Fine Gael champions the virtue of being honest with the people.  We hear it at every turn.  The Government will tell the people how it really is.  What did we get from the recent European summit?  Was retention of the 12.5% corporation tax not already secured in the protocol to the second Lisbon treaty?  Presumably, the people are not expected to remember that.The policies pursued by Fianna Fáil and endorsed in the EU-IMF bailout are to be relentlessly pursued, but all done under the cover of a series of bluffing games, media opportunities and dashes off to Brussels.  Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gilmore, announced his plans to tour European capitals, sweeten up our European partners and present to them the new face of Irish politics.  There may be new faces but they are the same old policies.  Locking the stable door after the horse has bolted is what comes to mind.The economic policies being followed by the Fine Gael-Labour Government amount to little more than further deregulation of labour markets, wage cuts, tax increases and reductions in Government spending.  While these crippling measures are being pursued, the Government's recent stress tests exposed further bad news.  We are on our fifth attempt to stabilise the banks.  Put simply, we are just biding our time until we hit eventual default, which is the taboo word.  We are told it is not an option and cannot and will not become a reality, even though outside the windows of Europe the rest of the world is telling us that default is clearly on the horizon.  In Ireland today, German and French banks hold only €10 billion of our sovereign debt yet they hold €74.5 billion of Irish bank debt.  Need we ask ourselves why both countries are so adamant that the Irish cannot and must not contemplate default.The Government has committed the people to borrowing billions of euro from the EU and IMF at extortionate interest rates in order to pay back the monstrous debts incurred by insolvent banks.  European institutions, including the European Trade Union Institute, ETUI, the European Trade Union Confederation, ETUC, and the International Labour Organisation, ILO, are all critical of this path.  These institutions believe Ireland does not have a competitiveness problem and does not need to reduce Irish workers' wages.  It is Germany, the country now calling the shots on our economic crisis, that needs to look at how it contributed to the Europe-wide debt problems.  In real terms, Germany's wages increased no more than 1% since 2000.  If Germany increased its own workers' wages rather than demanding that peripheral countries, such as Ireland, decrease theirs, it would go a long way towards rebalancing the European wage scale.  Germany's low wage and low tax policies created the erroneous perception that Ireland is uncompetitive within the labour market.  The ETUI, the ETUC and the ILO believe that to engage in years of austerity in the absence of co-ordinated public investment plans from Europe can only depress the Irish economy further.  The focus has to be on growth and jobs.  This is not a case of transferring welfare payments from the rich countries of Europe to the poor, as is now believed by the average German taxpayer, or of Ireland passing the begging bowl and asking for handouts.  It is about solidarity between the core countries of Europe and those on the periphery.  Only today, the former Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael, Mr. John Bruton, pointed this out.Elite policy makers across the EU are responsible for the eurozone debt crisis.  Ireland's problem is a European problem, and reflects a structural imbalance between the core and the periphery.  The 1.8 million Irish taxpayers cannot afford to pay the creditors of private European banks who lent recklessly to Irish banks, accumulating more than €150 billion in debt.   Global wages increased on average by 22% in the period from 2000 to 2009 while in the United States and in Europe wages only increased by 5% during that period.  Labour productivity, on the other hand, increased by 11%.  In other words, wages increased only half as fast as productivity.  It is obvious the biggest beneficiaries to rapid growth, productivity and profits, were the employers yet it is wage earners who are being asked to carry the burden for the reckless behaviour of those in financial capital markets.  Those who benefited from the cheap money boom are the people in the top 10% of income distribution yet they are being asked to contribute nothing towards solving their own mess.  One could not make it up.	spk_261

They should tell that to the people who have watched our State being bankrupt to pay off the debts of reckless millionaires and billionaires not just in this country but across Europe.

They have defended the universal social charge as if they were the former Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  One would think they had introduced the universal social charge themselves such was their ideological support for this totally unjust tax which puts an additional burden on ordinary working people and lets off the very wealthy.  The Government quoted figures from the OECD and talked about 10% of people paying 39.1% of taxes.  How much wealth does that 10% own in this State?  This is one of the most unequal societies in the developed world.  That is a reality.	spk_526

What was really interesting last night was watching the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, talk about the Six Counties.  Apparently, there were bonfires burning in south Armagh, Tyrone, west Belfast and other parts of Belfast to celebrate the fact that Fine Gael at last has an interest in the people of the Six Counties.  Where were they all the years when we needed them?  They were imprisoning people and keeping down those who tried to do something for the people of the Six Counties.  The reality, if the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, took time to educate himself, is that the people of the Six Counties are fighting to gain fiscal powers to have control over their own budgets so they can make real decisions for their communities.  They are on that journey.  What did we do in this State, where we had fiscal powers?  We gave them away to the EU and IMF.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, should have a wee bit of humility when he is backing up the view of the former Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who gave our sovereignty away.	spk_528

Members know the realities in terms of its impact on the ground.  Fine Gael has now put its right-wing clothing on.  I single out Deputy Peter Matthews.  His comments were thoughtful and represent an element within Fine Gael that clearly does not drift towards the right wing when it gets the chance.  Is the Labour Party seriously going to serve for five years with people who articulate the views in the speech made last night by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes?  Is that what it will do to its values and where it comes from?.  The Labour Party knows whom it represents.  It represents the same people that Sinn Féin and the Independent Deputies represent.  Are its members going to betray their interests for right-wing ideology yet again, because the people voted with hope in their hearts that those days of the elites, tents, Moriarty and Mahon tribunals were over, that the wealthy elites would not control and that we would have fair, progressive taxation in this State?  We do not have it at this point.  The Ministers, Deputies Joan Burton and Róisín Shortall, said the USC was squeezing the poor, that it was a blatant and unjustifiable attack on the poor.  That is what they said.  That is how strongly they felt about this tax.  The one or two Ministers who were present last night listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, talk about this being a fair, progressive State and they never said a word.  They spoke about working in co-operation.	spk_530
Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-03-30	dail	31	Universal Service Charge: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_28	Deputy Broughan is one of the people on the left of the Labour Party and in his heart it must be hurting him to witness this behaviour.Let us just deal with the facts.  The Government speaks of alternatives.  My alternative, which the Labour Party once supported, is to introduce a new rate of taxation of 48%.  This would raise exactly the same additional income as the universal social charge.  That is the choice to be made and it is a question of choices.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to a 1% tax on the assets of the very wealthy.  It is estimated by very progressive economists that this would raise over €1 billion.  These are the choices that exist.The Labour Party should examine its soul and listen to the people it represents.  If it is to stand by and allow Fine Gael, whose members, with the exception of a few notable people, espouse a right-wing ideology, to get away with its agenda over the course of the next five years, it will have committed as big a betrayal of the people it represents as Fianna Fáil.	spk_532

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-03-23	dail	31	Response to the Aftermath of the Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan: Statements	dbsect_13	"I express deepest sympathy on behalf of myself and Sinn Féin to the people of Japan.  It was an event that evoked a genuine outpouring of grief in this country and across the globe.  It was dreadful, and we are only beginning to realise now the full extent of the disaster with the numbers of people missing and killed exceeding first estimates.  It may be some time before we realise the actual numbers involved, and longer before the communities affected begin to return to normality.The tragedy caused by the earthquake and the tsunami was exacerbated by the scare over the impact the earthquake had on nuclear power stations in the region.  For a while it appeared the environmental disaster might have been exacerbated to a horrific level by an accident at one of the power stations.  Thankfully, the initial fears have not been realised, although dangers remain.While it is not the time or the place to make lengthy political arguments on the back of these awful events, the danger posed by a possible leakage of high levels of radiation from the reactors must be mentioned.  It is hoped that danger is not as serious as was first feared but we have already heard reports of radiation contamination of food and the threat that poses to the Japanese people.  Some food products have been withdrawn.  We are not yet aware of the full impact that leaking radiation may have had on the food supply and on people's well-being.  That again highlights the dangers associated with nuclear power.  We are fortunate here in that when the building of a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point was given serious consideration in the late 1970s, the popular opposition to it forced the then Government to change its mind.  It is clear now that the Irish people made the right choice.I am conscious that there are always concerns regarding the Sellafield plant in Britain.  Now would be the time for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the relevant colleagues in Cabinet, to re-engage with the British Government about the long-standing concerns of the Irish people in that regard, and in particular to get an update on the review of its emergency plan.  That would be an important occasion to re-engage with them.Energy supply is a serious issue and one that will arise more frequently in the coming years.  That is all the more reason we must examine alternative forms of energy supply globally that will both guarantee that energy needs are met but also provide a safer option to nuclear power.  However, this is not the time to dwell too much on that aspect of the terrible events in Japan.  Such a debate can wait another day.One of the positive aspects of the crisis, if there can be any in such circumstances, was the evidence of the manner in which the Japanese people, and the international community, responded to the effects of the earthquake.  There was a genuine outpouring of grief that transcended cultures and that manifested itself in practical aid in terms of ensuring that the after effects of the tsunami and the dreadful damage it wreaked were immediately addressed.  It demonstrates that there is a positive aspect to international solidarity that transcends the more brutal manner in which it is sometimes manifested in military actions involving the major powers.In the context of that international solidarity and aid, it is important to refer to the new Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Seán Barrett, who, in his time as Fine Gael's spokesperson for foreign affairs, raised the concept of a citizens' corps that would be ready to be deployed to provide international assistance in the event of a disaster such as that which took place in Japan.  He referred to the possibility of people who are unemployed taking part in such a corps.  There is a fantastic culture here of people wanting to assist in these circumstances, as we know from all the Irish organisations that assist people overseas.  It is an excellent idea.  In the aftermath of the disaster, and as we reflect on what happened and offer our sympathy, this might also be the time to pursue that idea.Such a corps could comprise volunteers who are specialists in various fields who would be ready and prepared to travel immediately to disaster zones to participate in aid missions.  There would be scope for medical personnel, civil engineers, members of the fire service and so on who could participate in such a group.  As we saw from Japan, the early deployment of experienced search and rescue personnel from overseas played a crucial part in the aftermath of the tsunami and undoubtedly contributed to the saving of many lives that might otherwise have been lost.I am not certain what branch of Government would be responsible for establishing such a citizen corps.  It might be something the Department of Foreign Affairs might examine and set in train the process of establishing such an initiative.  It would constitute a real and practical contribution on the part of the people of this country to helping in the event of any future disasters should they occur anywhere on the planet.While international aid was important, I would also like to pay tribute to the manner in which the Japanese people responded to the disaster.  It is a very different culture to our own, although human beings of whatever nationality or culture share the basic common attributes.  It is heartening to know that in the midst of such a calamity, the vast majority of people respond in a humane way, even in circumstances where much of the basic structures of civilised society have temporarily broken down.There is a bleak view of humanity as expressed, for example, in the film ""The Road"", which was set in the aftermath of a huge disaster, possibly nuclear.  That human society is portrayed as being unable to survive such a shock, and people revert to a barbaric state.  The response to the Japanese disaster may offer hope that human beings are perhaps better than that, and that society is able to respond to and survive in such circumstances."	spk_197

Is he aware that the detention of the individual in question appears to violate Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights dealing with the detention of prisoners and of the UN standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners?  Is the Tánaiste further aware that Manfred Nowak, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, is to carry out an investigation into the detention of this individual?Given, as I stated earlier, Ireland's well deserved reputation for defending human rights throughout the world, will Ireland take a stand on this issue?  I, as much as anybody else in this Chamber, respect President Barrack Obama who made torture at Guantanamo Bay and so on one of the planks of his campaign.  It is important to be consistent, in particular for a President who has given hope to so many of us in progressive politics.	spk_103

The Tánaiste may have read some of the recent news articles in Ireland on this issue which is causing a great deal of concern.The programme for Government commits to ensuring rendition flights are not passing through Shannon.  Will the Tánaiste assure us that there will be, at the very least, an investigation by his Department into what has happened to date and that Shannon is not being used as a thoroughfare for this type of activity?  I refer again to our well deserved reputation in defending human rights internationally.  There can be no room for grey areas.	spk_105

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-03-22	dail	31	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_23	"I wish to share the final five minutes of my time with Deputy McDonald.  Looking forward to this week's European Union summit, we hear the word ""co-operation"" bandied about.  Co-operation is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as the action or process of working together to the same end.  To intimidate means to frighten or overawe, especially to make another do what one wants.  There is a world of difference between co-operation and intimidation.  One outcome of the meeting of European leaders last week was that Greece secured a lower interest rate on its borrowings.  What was the cost?  It had to agree to sell €50 billion of state assets.  When the Greek economy is gutted completely, when all vehicles of growth have been auctioned off, when there is no mechanism to begin paying back these extortionate loans, what will a difference of 100 basis points amount to?When Ireland went cap in hand to get a reduction, we were told ""No"".  Angela Merkel said that it was simply fair to say they could only give a commitment when they got something in return.  However, Germany and France continue to get something every time we put another €1 billion of taxpayers' money into our banks in order that German and French banks do not take a hit.  They get something with each budget when billions of euro is taken out of ordinary people's pockets in order that the Government can adhere to the strict terms and conditions imposed by the EU.  They get something each time the prospect of burden sharing is taken off the table.At this week's meeting, the pact for the euro will be converted into a binding agreement for euro area countries, representing a deep European penetration into national political and policy freedoms without any genuine democratic mandate.  The effective lending capacity of the European rescue funds will be bumped up to meet the original goal of €500 billion through higher guarantees and injections of capital, although the precise mix and timing have yet to be spelt out.  It will concentrate on actions where competence lies with the member states, constraining somewhat their autonomy to set policy by way of an annual system of setting common targets and national commitments, reporting and evaluation by the Commission and Council.  It stipulates that all eurozone countries should put into law a pledge to get a grip on public debt.  There are no provisions for compulsion or sanctions on member states.  The reliance is on peer pressure.  Only those seeking the support of the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and European Stability Mechanism, ESM, will be forced to make policy changes.  How can this be co-operation?  An IMF-type institution will be established for Europe, the lending of which will be senior to that of private sector bondholders and which will be able to impose restructuring agreements and haircuts.  As with all mention of burden sharing in Europe, however, this will only take place after 2013.  Is the pact aimed at the right problems?  No.  How can it be when the German Chancellor is facing into an electoral challenge this week?One cause of market turmoil is fear of contagion because of the fragility of Europe's banks.  However, any sensible debate about restructuring debt in the near term has been completely blocked although, confusingly, Germany insists that bondholders must bear more of the burden in future.  The European Commission and French and German Governments' hard-line position on private debt restructuring in the future, whether in the form of haircuts for bondholders or debt-for-bank-equity swaps, merely rubs salt into the wounds of the people.The Government must inform the people of the measures it intends to pledge to implement this week under the pact for the next year.  It must outline the concrete commitments to be achieved in the next 12 months in the name of the people.  What is it bringing to the table this week?  The people also deserve to know when the timetable for the gradual paying in of capital to the new fund will be established.  How much capital must the people put into this fund in order that we may get it out at a later date as a loan at some extortionate interest rate?  These are the small details of this pact which escape public attention.  We will be paying into a fund that we will most likely access at a later date at a high rate of interest.  It is like a burglar robbing one's home and then charging one to take away the loot.One of the most pressing issues in this pact relates to the European Stability Mechanism whereby any decision to provide assistance will be taken by unanimity on the basis of a debt sustainability analysis of the member state concerned conducted by the Commission and the IMF in liaison with the European Central Bank.  Where was this debt sustainability analysis before Ireland drew down the crippling EU IMF loan?  Will there be such an analysis?  These are the questions our Government must ask and these are the things for which this Government must fight.The dogs on the street know that the current debt burden is unsustainable.  The world and its mother knows that there is no way the people will be able to support bondholders of German and French banks indefinitely while dealing with packages of income cuts, public service decimation and taxes on everything bar the wealth of the State.During the election the Taoiseach stated there would be burden sharing.  He said that no longer would the people carry the debts of private banks on their backs.  He said Irish sovereign default was becoming closer to reality because of the strangulation of private debt.  Sinn Féin has always said as much.  Ours was the only party which rejected the bailout on that basis.  Ours was the only party that did not suggest renegotiating the interest rate when in reality the whole deal was rotten.  Ours was the only party which held that the people could not afford the terms and conditions of the bailout.  Unfortunately, we were right.  Unemployment is at a record high of 14.7%.  An increasing number of people are making the decision on whether they can afford to feed their families or pay their mortgage.  Some 1,000 people are emigrating every week.The choice is clear.  Will the Taoiseach stand up for Ireland and challenge head on the blatant injustice of the EU-IMF package or will he repeat the disastrous policies of the last Government, which amounted to a betrayal of the Irish people?  For all our sakes, I hope he makes the right decision."	spk_287

Padraig Mac Lochlainn	38	Unknown	Donegal	#PadraigMacLochlainn	2011-03-15	dail	31	Programme for Government: Motion	dbsect_9	The people came out in huge numbers on 25 February last with hope in their hearts for change, for new political leadership and for a challenge to the injustice they have faced for so long now.Like all the Deputies in the House today, I canvassed my constituency of Donegal North-East and I listened to what I can only describe as the stories of despair related to emigration again in Donegal.  The Taoiseach, as a Mayo man, will be aware of the impact of emigration on his county.  On the impact of unemployment, one in three of the working people of Donegal are out of work.  I also heard stories of cutbacks and the struggle to pay the bills.However, there were also remarkable people who will turn this country around.  I came across a woman aged 83 who cares for her 22 year old foster son, who was paralysed in a road accident.  She has nurtured him, by love, by compassion and by support, back slowly towards having a decent standard of life.  These are the people who deserve the support of the Republic and of us in this House, but they have been utterly failed.It is a fundamental injustice that ordinary working families have been asked to pay the bills of those who were reckless in the financial institutions.  This was a failure not merely in the Irish banking system but in the European and international banking system, and yet the ordinary families in Ireland, one of the smallest states in the European Union, have been asked to carry that burden.  That is a fundamental injustice that nobody can defend and they hope for change in that regard.Fine Gael and Labour have won the endorsement of approximately 56% of the people and good luck to them, but they campaigned on something that is very different to what is in the programme for Government.  They did not say they would deliver more of the same.  They did not say they would not reverse the cuts that have impacted so severely on families such as the universal social charge and the cuts to the unemployed, pensioners in terms of the blind pension and to those on disability payments.  Those are the ones who suffered the impact.  Student nurses have taken cuts and young students and hard-working families must pay more to send their children to third level education.  They said they would do something about all of those matters.They stated that they would deal with the issue of banking and not allow it to cripple the economy.  They did not speak of water charges.  They did not speak of property taxes.  They did not speak of stealth charges.  These are the realities.  The campaign they presented to the people does not relate to what is in this programme for Government.The people voted for change with hope in their hearts.  They voted for new political leadership.  Our communities have been savaged by this financial crisis.  They need to have their faith restored in the political system, not shattered.  If the Government implements this programme for Government and if it does not challenge our European partners to do what is right and fair, it will fail them and their faith will be shattered yet again.  We cannot have that.Sinn Féin laid out its plan clearly.  We said we need to separate the banking debt from the sovereign debt to take it off the backs of the people.  We said that we need to stimulate the economy using the pensions reserve fund to get the economy moving again.  We said that the Government can cut the deficit by asking the very wealthy to pay their fair share and asking highly paid civil servants to take a real cut.  A €200,000 wage for the Taoiseach will not cut it with ordinary working families who struggle to pay their bills.  That is the reality in terms of what has happened with the Government parties.The issues of cutting the interest rate and corporation tax are distractions.  Intelligent people know that these are distractions.  What is needed is for the Government to stand up to our European partners.  What they have done fundamentally unjust.  It is clearly wrong to ask ordinary working families to carry the burden for a fundamental failure and crisis in the banking system across Europe.  We must be seen by the international community to stand up to those partners and not have distractions and side shows around interest rates and corporation tax.The Taoiseach spoke of 2016 in his opening address as Taoiseach and he spoke about the 1916 Proclamation.  He knows in his heart that what we have endured, not only in recent years but for decades, has nothing to do with the hope of the 1916 Proclamation.  For the 83 year old woman, for her 22 year old foster son and for all those who are unemployed in Donegal, Mayo and across the State, I genuinely hope the Taoiseach succeeds.  The programme for Government is not a template for success; it is a template for more of the same.  It will shatter the hope for change that brought the people out in huge numbers.  I implore the Taoiseach and his colleagues in Government to not pursue this direction and to deliver a real republic and a real revolution for change which is what the people deserve.	spk_129
