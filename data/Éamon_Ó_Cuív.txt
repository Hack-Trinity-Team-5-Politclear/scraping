He previously served asDeputy leader of Fianna F\u00e1ilfrom 2011 to 2012, asMinister for Social Protectionfrom 2010 to 2011,Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairsfrom 2002 to 2010, and as aMinister of Statefrom 1997 to 2002. He also served asMinister for the Environment, Community and Local GovernmentandMinister for Defencefrom January to March 2011, appointed to these positions in addition to his own on the resignation of other members of the government.He served as aSenatorfor theCultural and Educational Panelfrom 1989 to 1992.[1]He unsuccessfully contested theleadership of Fianna F\u00e1ilafter the resignation ofBrian Cowen. He lost toMiche\u00e1l Martin. Martin appointed \u00d3 Cu\u00edv as Deputy leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, followingBrian Lenihan Jnr's death. However, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv ceased to be Deputy leader of Fianna F\u00e1il on 29 February 2012, because of his opposition to his party's stance on theEuropean Fiscal Compact. \u00d3 Cuiv is the grandson of Fianna F\u00e1il founder,TaoiseachandPresident of Ireland,\u00c9amon de Valera.Early life[edit]\u00d3 Cu\u00edv is the son ofBrian \u00d3 Cu\u00edv, professor of Celtic Studies atUniversity College Dublin, and Emer de Valera, who was the last surviving daughter ofFianna F\u00e1ilfounder,TaoiseachandPresident of Ireland,\u00c9amon de Valera, when she died at the age of 93 in February 2012.[2]He is a nephew ofVivion de Valera, a formerTD, and is a first cousin ofS\u00edle de Valera, formerMinister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, andAindrias \u00d3 Caoimh, former judge of theHigh Courtand of theEuropean Court of Justice.He was born inBlackrock, Dublinand was educated atOatlands College,DublinandUniversity College Dublin.[3]Before entering politics, he was the manager of Gaeltacht Co-operative, a company involved in agricultural services including timber milling, tourism and cultural development.[3]Surname[edit]\u00d3 Cu\u00edv's family surname was changed from\u00d3 Caoimhby his grandfather Sh\u00e1n \u00d3 Cu\u00edv, aCorkjournalist. In the early 20th century Sh\u00e1n changed the spelling of his surname to conform to a simplified spelling system of his own invention which he calledAn Leitri\u00fa Shimpl\u00ed.[4]The letter 'v' is extremely rare in Irish outside modern loanwords, not being one of the 18 letters of theIrish alphabet.[5][6]Political career[edit]National politics[edit]\u00d3 Cu\u00edv first stood for election toD\u00e1il \u00c9ireannat the1987 general electionin theGalway Westconstituency, where he was the last-placed of the four Fianna F\u00e1il candidates, only two of whom were elected. He did better in the1989 general election, substantially increasing his share of the first-preference votes, but was the only one of the three Fianna F\u00e1il candidates not to be elected.He was then elected to the19th Seanadas a Senator for theCultural and Educational Panel. He served there until the1992 general election, when he finally became a TD for Galway West. His vote had increased significantly and he was elected on the first count, coming a close second for Fianna F\u00e1il behind theLabour Party'sMichael D. Higgins. At the1997 general election, he was again elected in second place on the first count, this time being narrowly behind his Fianna F\u00e1il colleagueFrank Fahey. At the2002 general election, he comfortably topped the poll, with over 20% of the first-preference votes. \u00d3 Cu\u00edv again topped the poll in Galway West at the2007 general election.[7]In 1994, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv raised concern amongst some in Fianna F\u00e1il when he suggested the possibility of a prospective conditional return to theCommonwealth of Nationsas a gesture to Unionists in Northern Ireland.[8]However, a straw poll of backbench Fianna F\u00e1il TDs in 1998 showed that this had little support.[9]Ministerial career[edit]In 1997, he was appointedMinister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the islands, serving under his cousinS\u00edle de Valera, who was the senior minister at the department.[10]In 2001, he was reassigned asMinister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Developmentwith responsibility for rural development and the Western Development Commission.[11]Following the2002 general election, he was appointed to the cabinet asMinister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.[12]He publicly spoke of voting \"No\" in thefirst referendumon theTreaty of Nice. This caused controversy as the government of which he was a member had negotiated the Treaty and called for a \"Yes\" vote.[13]As minister, he introduced theOfficial Languages Act 2003, which created the office ofAn Coimisin\u00e9ir Teanga.\u00d3 Cu\u00edv was at the centre of a controversy surrounding the official name of An Daingean /Dingle, a small Gaeltacht town in westCounty Kerry. The residents of the town held a plebiscite in November 2006, to determine which version of the town name should be used. \u00d3 Cu\u00edv originally signalled that he was happy to abide by the locals' decision,[citation needed]but then said that the name could not legally be changed back to Dingle, following advice from theAttorney General of Ireland.\u00d3 Cu\u00edv was re-appointed to the same cabinet position after the 2007 election, and again in 2008 whenBrian Cowensucceeded as Taoiseach.[14][15]In 2007, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv again called for Ireland to return to the Commonwealth as a full member state, in light of the restoration ofdevolutiontoNorthern Irelandand the meeting of theCommonwealth Parliamentary AssociationinBelfast.[16]In July 2009, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv used a government helicopter to open a playground, at the cost of \u20ac10,000.[17]On 23 March 2010, in acabinet reshuffle, he was appointed asMinister for Social Protection. After the resignation ofTony Killeenin January 2011, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv was also appointed asMinister for Defence,[18]and he was also appointedMinister for the Environment, Heritage and Local GovernmentafterJohn Gormley's resignation days later.[19]On 22 January 2011, after the resignation of Fianna F\u00e1il leaderBrian Cowen, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv stated that he wished to be a candidate in the resultingelection for the leadership of Fianna F\u00e1il. He confirmed this on theTG4News.Opposition[edit]\u00d3 Cuiv was the Fianna F\u00e1il Spokesperson for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources after Fianna F\u00e1il were ousted from power at the2011 general election. On 8 August 2011, party leaderMiche\u00e1l Martin, named \u00d3 Cuiv as deputy leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, replacingBrian Lenihan.On 29 February 2012, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv resigned as Fianna F\u00e1il's deputy leader and Communications Spokesperson. He resigned from these positions due to dissatisfaction with his party's position on theFiscal Compact Referendum.[20][21]Fianna F\u00e1il leaderMiche\u00e1l Martinstated that \u00d3 Cu\u00edv would face expulsion from the parliamentary party if he did not vote with the party on the Fiscal Compact in the D\u00e1il.[22]Coming just a week before their party conference, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv's resignation caused a split down the middle of the Fianna F\u00e1il party.[23]On 12 July 2012, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv was reappointed to the Fianna F\u00e1il front bench as Spokesperson for Agriculture and Food, and on Community Affairs.[24]The post of deputy leader was not filled in the reshuffle. On 8 November 2018, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv was sacked from the Fianna F\u00e1il front bench for unveiling a candidate in a Northern Ireland election without the party's permission.[25]In 2018, he was one of 25 TDs to vote against theThirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, which proposed to replace the protection of the life of the unborn inserted by theEighth Amendmentwith a provision allowing the termination of pregnancy to be regulated by law.[26]This amendment was approved in a referendum in May 2018 by 66.4%, including 65.9% in his constituency. \u00d3 Cu\u00edv was one of 15 TDs to vote against theHealth (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill, which became law at the end of 2018.[27]Following the2020 general election, he said that he was \"completely against\" Fianna F\u00e1il forming acoalition governmentwithFine Gaeland theGreen Party.[28]He later went on to publicly doubt theprogramme for government.[29]See also[edit]Families in the OireachtasReferences[edit]^\"\u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv\".Oireachtas Members Database.Archivedfrom the original on 4 July 2019.

At the beginning there was only a committee, me as manager, and a share capital of IR\u00a33,500. As this was a sheep farming area, the first task was to build a unit to fatten 2,000 sheep in. We also started trading in farm supplies, although due to the oil crisis the sheep fattening did not work out, and the co-op branched into activities such as timber milling, an Irish college, machinery hire, and farming.When I was a few years there I was invited to a meeting of the local Fianna F\u00e1il Cumann. I then became the Cumann Chair and in time the Comhairle Ceantair Secretary. As a manager of a community co-op in a rural area I was constantly hampered in my work by the lack of infrastructure such as telecommunications, roads, three-phase power supply, and also with the cost of trying to do business in a remote location. This drew me into politics more and more at the local level. I stood at a number of selection conventions and eventually got a chance to run in the 1985 local elections in which I failed to get elected. I then, after a great effort, against the head by diligently canvassing 500 delegates, got a nomination to run in the general election of 1987. I was eventually eliminated with 4,800 votes and failed to get a seat.I ran again in 1989 and again failed to get elected losing by less than 150 votes. I ran for the Seanad in 1989 and managed to get elected. In 1991, I got elected to Galway County Council and in 1992, at the third attempt, I got elected to the D\u00e1il and have successfully gotten re-elected at the last six general elections.What are your proudest achievements in the Oireachtas to date?I had the great privilege of having been a minister for over 13 years and was active in many spheres during that time. In the 1990s, I started work with republican prisoners in England and also in the North of Ireland pre-Good Friday Agreement. I hope my work played a small part in the lead up to that agreement. I have also being quietly doing this work again since 2011 and will continue to do so as long as I need to. As a minister with the responsibility for the Irish language I piloted through the first Official Languages Act, and was minister when Irish became an official language of the EU. I also set up the office of Language Commissioner, as well as many other schemes, and was Minister when Foras na Gaeilge was founded.\u201cI have not changed my mind in relation to my stance at the formation of this government and feel that despite their best efforts, they are being stymied from being as radical as I would like.\u201d\u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv TD on Fianna F\u00e1il ministersIn rural and community development, I set up the Rural Social Scheme, the Cl\u00e1r programme, the Community Services Programme, and Comhairle na Tuaithe. I also instituted the largest programme of development of island services and infrastructure ever. At present I am working on a Private Member\u2019s Bill that would allow for the opening of historic safe deposits in banks and their display by the National Institutions as appropriate. The Bill has gone through second stage and pre-legislative scrutiny and I am hopeful it will become law in this term of the Oireachtas.What is unique about representing the Galway West constituency?Galway West is a very interesting constituency that covers a large geographic area including four populated offshore islands. It also has the largest Gaeltacht in the country. It is very diverse, including within its borders a fertile agricultural area to the east of the city, Galway City, Conamara and, for the last two D\u00e1il terms, a part of south County Mayo.It is unique in that in my time in the D\u00e1il there were always at least three TDs that were fluent in the Irish language, which is the dominant language in the Gaeltacht areas. Living 60km from the city with only 2,000 electors living within 30km of my home, stamina and a willingness to do a lot of travel within the constituency have been a constant of my career in politics. However, the most rewarding thing about representing Galway West has been the fantastic friends I have made over many years without whose support my work would not be possible.How can Fianna F\u00e1il maximise its impact during the lifetime of the current government?As is publicly known, I campaigned within Fianna F\u00e1il against the formation of the present government. I did of course accept the verdict of the members of the party in favour of joining Fine Gael and the Green Party in government. After three-and-a-half years of this government, I would like to compliment the Fianna F\u00e1il ministers on the work they have done but I have not changed my mind in relation to my stance at the formation of this government and feel that despite their best efforts, they are being stymied from being as radical as I would like in pursuit of policies to deal with the urgent issues facing our society. In the meantime, all we can do is to continue to try pursue Fianna F\u00e1il policies within the confines of this coalition until the end of its term.What are your interests outside of the political sphere?My main non-political interests are my family, sport (particularly Gaelic sports), history, walking, and the Irish language and culture. No matter what my schedule was over the years, I always tried to make it my business to attend any matches our children were involved in. As president of Cumann Naomh P\u00e1draig, An Fh\u00e1irche, one of the great highlights was when the local football team won the Junior Club All-Ireland in Croke Park in February 2012 with our son \u00c9amon playing at midfield. It is now great to see our grandchildren grow up and to support them in their endeavours and interests.TagsIssue 61December 2023Show MoreShareFacebookXLinkedInWhatsAppShare via EmailCheck AlsoClosePublic AffairsEuropean elections 2024: What to expectFebruary 2024AnalysisGovernment misses waiting list reduction targetAnalysis,IssuesHousing 2022 reflections  Overall housing target on track but crisis aboundsAnalysis,IssuesGalway City: The beating heart of the westAnalysis,Regional focus: Galway City CouncilThe cost-of-living budgetAnalysis,IssuesCategoriesCategoriesSelect Category100 years of policing reportAgribusiness magazineAgriculture Food and DrinkAnalysisBanking & FinanceBrexitBusinessClimate COP26 reportConnectivity and future of workConnectivity reportCover StoryCybersecurity reportData protection reportDelivering cost rental housing reportDigitalDigital government reportDigital government reportEconomyEducationEnergy & EnvironmentEnergyEnvironmentRetrofiteolasEurope and BrexitFeaturedFintech ReportFuture of policing reportFuture of rail reportFuture of work and connectivity reportHealth and care servicesHousingInfrastructureRoad safetyInfrastructure and construction reportIssuesJusticeLocal GovernmentLocal government reportMol an \u00f3igePeoplePoliticsPublic AffairsReformRegional focus: Galway City CouncilRegional focus: Leitrim County CouncilReportsArtificial intelligence reportInfrastructure and construction reportRetrofitting reportRound table discussion: Cyber-resilience in an age of ransomwareRound table discussion: Digital transformation of public servicesRound table discussion: Driving electric vehicle adoption in IrelandRound table discussion: Evolution or revolution?

However, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv ceased to be Deputy leader of Fianna F\u00e1il on 29 February 2012, because of his opposition to his party's stance on the European Fiscal Compact. \u00d3 Cuiv is the grandson of Fianna F\u00e1il founder, Taoiseach and President of Ireland, \u00c9amon de Valera....\u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv (Irish pronunciation: [\u02c8e\u02d0m\u02e0\u0259n\u032a\u02e0 o\u02d0 \u02c8ki\u02d0v\u02b2]; born 23 June 1950) is an Irish Fianna F\u00e1il politician who has been a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Galway West constituency since the 1992 general election.

However, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv ceased to be Deputy leader of Fianna F\u00e1il on 29 February 2012, because of his opposition to his party's stance on the European Fiscal Compact. \u00d3 Cuiv is the grandson of Fianna F\u00e1il founder, Taoiseach and President of Ireland, \u00c9amon de Valera.Early life\u00d3 Cu\u00edv is the son of Brian \u00d3 Cu\u00edv, professor of Celtic Studies at University College Dublin, and Emer de Valera, who was the last surviving daughter of Fianna F\u00e1il founder, Taoiseach and President of Ireland, \u00c9amon de Valera, when she died at the age of 93 in February 2012. He is a nephew of Vivion de Valera, a former TD, and is a first cousin of S\u00edle de Valera, former Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and Aindrias \u00d3 Caoimh, former judge of the High Court and of the European Court of Justice.He was born in Blackrock, Dublin and was educated at Oatlands College, Dublin and University College Dublin. Before entering politics, he was the manager of Gaeltacht Co-operative, a company involved in agricultural services including timber milling, tourism and cultural development.Surname\u00d3 Cu\u00edv's family surname was changed from \u00d3 Caoimh by his grandfather Sh\u00e1n \u00d3 Cu\u00edv, a Cork journalist. In the early 20th century Sh\u00e1n changed the spelling of his surname to conform to a simplified spelling system of his own invention which he called An Leitri\u00fa Shimpl\u00ed. The letter 'v' is extremely rare in Irish outside modern loanwords, not being one of the 18 letters of the Irish alphabet.Political careerNational politics\u00d3 Cu\u00edv first stood for election to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann at the 1987 general election in the Galway West constituency, where he was the last-placed of the four Fianna F\u00e1il candidates, only two of whom were elected. He did better in the 1989 general election, substantially increasing his share of the first-preference votes, but was the only one of the three Fianna F\u00e1il candidates not to be elected.He was then elected to the 19th Seanad as a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel. He served there until the 1992 general election, when he finally became a TD for Galway West. His vote had increased significantly and he was elected on the first count, coming a close second for Fianna F\u00e1il behind the Labour Party's Michael D. Higgins. At the 1997 general election, he was again elected in second place on the first count, this time being narrowly behind his Fianna F\u00e1il colleague Frank Fahey. At the 2002 general election, he comfortably topped the poll, with over 20% of the first-preference votes. \u00d3 Cu\u00edv again topped the poll in Galway West at the 2007 general election.In 1994, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv raised concern amongst some in Fianna F\u00e1il when he suggested the possibility of a prospective conditional return to the Commonwealth of Nations as a gesture to Unionists in Northern Ireland. However, a straw poll of backbench Fianna F\u00e1il TDs in 1998 showed that this had little support.Ministerial careerIn 1997, he was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the islands, serving under his cousin S\u00edle de Valera, who was the senior minister at the department. In 2001, he was reassigned as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development with responsibility for rural development and the Western Development Commission.Following the 2002 general election, he was appointed to the cabinet as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.He publicly spoke of voting \"No\" in the first referendum on the Treaty of Nice. This caused controversy as the government of which he was a member had negotiated the Treaty and called for a \"Yes\" vote.As minister, he introduced the Official Languages Act 2003, which created the office of An Coimisin\u00e9ir Teanga.\u00d3 Cu\u00edv was at the centre of a controversy surrounding the official name of An Daingean / Dingle, a small Gaeltacht town in west County Kerry. The residents of the town held a plebiscite in November 2006, to determine which version of the town name should be used. \u00d3 Cu\u00edv originally signalled that he was happy to abide by the locals' decision, but then said that the name could not legally be changed back to Dingle, following advice from the Attorney General of Ireland.\u00d3 Cu\u00edv was re-appointed to the same cabinet position after the 2007 election, and again in 2008 when Brian Cowen succeeded as Taoiseach.In 2007, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv again called for Ireland to return to the Commonwealth as a full member state, in light of the restoration of devolution to Northern Ireland and the meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Belfast.In July 2009, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv used a government helicopter to open a playground, at the cost of \u20ac10,000. On 23 March 2010, in a cabinet reshuffle, he was appointed as Minister for Social Protection. After the resignation of Tony Killeen in January 2011, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv was also appointed as Minister for Defence, and he was also appointed Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government after John Gormley's resignation days later. On 22 January 2011, after the resignation of Fianna F\u00e1il leader Brian Cowen, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv stated that he wished to be a candidate in the resulting election for the leadership of Fianna F\u00e1il. He confirmed this on the TG4 News.Opposition\u00d3 Cuiv was the Fianna F\u00e1il Spokesperson for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources after Fianna F\u00e1il were ousted from power at the 2011 general election. On 8 August 2011, party leader Miche\u00e1l Martin, named \u00d3 Cuiv as deputy leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, replacing Brian Lenihan.On 29 February 2012, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv resigned as Fianna F\u00e1il's deputy leader and Communications Spokesperson. He resigned from these positions due to dissatisfaction with his party's position on the Fiscal Compact Referendum. Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin stated that \u00d3 Cu\u00edv would face expulsion from the parliamentary party if he did not vote with the party on the Fiscal Compact in the D\u00e1il. Coming just a week before their party conference, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv's resignation caused a split down the middle of the Fianna F\u00e1il party.On 12 July 2012, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv was reappointed to the Fianna F\u00e1il front bench as Spokesperson for Agriculture and Food, and on Community Affairs. The post of deputy leader was not filled in the reshuffle. On 8 November 2018, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv was sacked from the Fianna F\u00e1il front bench for unveiling a candidate in a Northern Ireland election without the party's permission.In 2018, he was one of 25 TDs to vote against the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, which proposed to replace the protection of the life of the unborn inserted by the Eighth Amendment with a provision allowing the termination of pregnancy to be regulated by law. This amendment was approved in a referendum in May 2018 by 66.4%, including 65.9% in his constituency. \u00d3 Cu\u00edv was one of 15 TDs to vote against the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill, which became law at the end of 2018.Following the 2020 general election, he said that he was \"completely against\" Fianna F\u00e1il forming a coalition government with Fine Gael and the Green Party. He later went on to publicly doubt the programme for government.See alsoFamilies in the OireachtasReferencesExternal linksOfficial website\u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv's page on the Fianna F\u00e1il websiteBiography from Wikipedia (see original) under licenceCC BY-SA 3.0Geographical originsThe map below shows the places where the ancestors of the famous person lived.Loading...An error has occured while loading the map.Submit your relationshipSubmit your relationshipLog in to your Geneanet accountForgot password?Wrong username or password.
