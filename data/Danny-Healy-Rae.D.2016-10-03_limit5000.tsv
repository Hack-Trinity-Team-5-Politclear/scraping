Danny HealyRae	71	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2024-02-21	dail	33	Healthcare Provision in Rural Communities: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"I am glad to have the opportunity to speak and thank Deputy McGrath and his staff for putting this important motion together. At the outset, I want to convey my deepest sympathy to Deputy Michael Collins, a member of our group, Councillor Danny Collins and the mother of Michael Lynch. Michael was a nephew of Deputy Collins and tragically lost his life in the last few days.We pass on our condolences and sincerely wish them strength and that God will assist them in this very difficult time they are encountering. This motion is basically about the lack of GPs. People cannot get a satisfactory service with GPs at present. Elderly people cannot get appointments. No GP is in a position to take on local families, including those returning to Killarney and many other parts of Kerry, because they are so overstretched. I remind the Minister of State that up to 5,000 new people with medical cards have been placed in Killarney. As these people have medical cards, the doctors have to take on so many of them. This is putting a severe strain on the service. I have dealt with many cases of people, including those returning to the area, who cannot get a doctor to take them on. I would also like to speak about ambulance delays. I know of a little baby of three months old who stopped breathing and the doctor could not attend. The doctor did the next best thing and organised an ambulance. It took an hour an a half to come and that is not satisfactory. A young life could have been lost. It is only by the grace of God that this child is still alive. That is serious stuff. What the reconfiguration of the ambulance service in 2012 has meant to local areas is a reduction in the service. The word they used at that time was ""reconfiguration"", but what it has meant is a reduction in the service. When people take family members into University Hospital Kerry, they have to wait many hours for doctors there. I had a call from a family whose mom was taken in there in the last few days. It was many hours before the doctor could attend to this elderly lady. She spent many hours on a trolley before she actually got a bed. One of the sons rang me again yesterday to say that the family have been advised by the hospital that some family member must come in to feed their mother and to attend to the tablets she needs to take. That this is happening brings it home to me in a very real way that there is a lack of medics, nurses and staff in University Hospital Kerry. A couple of years ago during Covid times - God help us - family members were not allowed to go in to feed their people. We can say that this left them seriously compromised without being fed properly. That was very wrong. It was a dark hour in our history when family members could not go in to visit their elderly people in the last days of their lives. When they became unconscious, everyone was let in. We have a serious problem in rural areas in getting a GP service. I thank Dr. Gary Stack and others who set up SouthDoc some years ago. My father, the late Jackie Healy-Rae, worked very hard with Dr. Stack and others to provide an out-of-hours service, but we do not have enough GPs in that service now. If you get sick on a Friday evening, it is a long wait until Monday morning. People cannot organise that they will not get sick during those hours because people do. Gone is the day when Dr. O'Callaghan or Dr. Boland would come to the house to the elderly person or whoever was sick. That time is long gone. We depend on SouthDoc but we need that service to be enhanced because the doctors start out in Killarney on one side and have to travel all the way through Kilgarvan and Kenmare back to the county bounds in Lauragh, down through Templenoe and Blackwater as far as Sneem and over Moll's Gap down into Killarney. They travel massive distances and they are under savage pressure to see after people. We need more GPs. As has been said already, they are the first point of contact for any family member who has someone sick or for an elderly person living on their own who is sick and needs a doctor. Sometimes it is desperately hard to talk to a doctor - to get one on the phone - because they are so busy. As I have said, families are being advised to come in to feed their elderly family members in the hospital. That shows how understaffed the hospital is. So much money is going into the HSE but we still do not have a proper service. I see all the people going out in the country early every morning, working hard and paying their taxes. This is one of the things their taxes are for. They are not getting the rewards for the taxes they are paying in this regard. The rural healthcare crisis extends to emergency dental care provision. Children are forced to wait up to ten years for treatment. Less than half of eligible children were seen under the school screening programme last year. This is terribly serious because if children outgrow the time for getting the treatment, their mouths may not be perfect anymore. They get one chance and we should be doing a lot more there. The rural healthcare crisis is further exacerbated by a severe shortage of home helps, the worsening crisis in every accident and emergency department, the non-existent mental healthcare service and the severe lack of residential places for people with physical and mental disabilities. Too often, I have heard stories from people who tried to get a place for their son or daughter. I have met those people. I feel very hurt when I am at the door looking for a vote and they tell me what happened. They tried to get their child kept in a residential place because they were worried, but it did not happen. As much as they minded them and tried - people know when a youngster is in trouble - they could not get the proper care for them and they lost them. That is a sad reflection of our healthcare system. I call on the Government to explain how, despite an increased national healthcare budget, the country is witnessing a steady deterioration of our health services, especially in rural communities. If all things were equal, we would still need more doctors to travel the expansive and extensive areas that they have to cover in rural places like the Iveragh Peninsula, the Dingle Peninsula and the Beara Peninsula on the south side of Kenmare Bay."	spk_23

It is a fact that there is a scarcity of school bus drivers. However, drivers of 70 years of age are no longer considered by Bus Éireann. It will not allow them to drive buses. Of course the safety of children is of paramount importance. There is discrimination against men and women when they become 70 years of age. They can drive lorries and buses all over the country. It is ironic that they can drive the same children to a football match, a picnic or whatever after school.	spk_192

I said it was totally unfair to give one section of the people in the country an advantage over another section of the people, those being private renters, our own people. It is grand for the Government to give what it wants to Ukrainians but it must do the very same thing for our own people. How can the Minister expect any person who is trying to live and has a house to rent to rent that house out at €800 to local people or our own people who are homeless and pay half back in tax as against getting €800 tax free from the State? Now, you must be fair or you must not be there at all. I am getting very worried that every day we have the Government in power, it is doing more damage and this country will finish up totally and absolutely broken the way the Government is flitting around with money. It is not its money. It is the people who get out in the morning early and work and pay maybe 40% of their income in tax and 4.5% USC on top of that. That is what the wrong is. It is not the Government’s money. If it is going to continue with this payment to people coming from Ukraine, and we all empathise and sympathise with their predicament, be fair about the bloody thing. That is what I am asking for the Government to be. It came out the other day that the Government paid €850,000 to house and accommodate dogs and pets for people coming from Ukraine. We have enough dogs and pets here in Ireland and there is plenty of them to be got. If it was a dog here, you would pay a dog licence for it. Did the Government pay for the dog licence as well on top of that? Those are the questions. The Government is paying €1.5 billion for hotel and commercial accommodation. God almighty, how is the country going to sustain that? And the Government is wondering about bringing in more of them. Be fair to everyone. Be fair to our own people. Be fair to the Ukraine people and to the asylum seekers who are coming here. The Government does not have accommodation for them. It does not have one iota of anything to provide separate accommodation for them in any town or village. The Government has 36% of hotel bed nights in Killarney taken up. What does that mean only that the footfall into the restaurants, the cafés and souvenir shops has all diminished and slowed down. So many people in Killarney town are gone out of business. They asked for simple things like forgoing rates or having a waiver on rates. Did the Government do it? No, it did not and it will not. It is absolutely ridiculous. Every day the Government is in power it is doing harm and the people do not trust it anymore. Whether it is a referendum or whatever it is bringing forward, the people do not trust it. The Government fires the money away that people are working hard for and it has no cognisance of the effect of what it is doing. I have no problem with the €800 to house Ukrainians, but God damn it, Minister, you must do the very same for our own people, or if not, get out of the job, and take Micheál Martin with you because he laughed and sneered at me for raising that issue a couple of weeks ago. The Government is out of order. It has gone beyond its remit. If there is a vote on this tonight, I call on every Deputy who was elected to this Chamber to vote against this proposal as it stands because it is not fair. It is not fair for those people who are homeless and are lying on the side of the streets. I heard from a woman this morning, a single woman who has been on the housing list for five years. The only house she can get in Tralee town is going to cost her €1,350 a month. The man who owns the house feels he is entitled to get it. Will the Government pay him €800 of that cost tax free? If you are getting €800 tax free, I wager that is at least €1,700 or €1,800 before you have to pay 50% of it back in tax. Minister, you have gone far beyond your remit. Unless the Government is getting money from Europe or something, and it should come out with it and tell us if it is, spending taxpayers' money with reckless disregard like this is shameful. Shame on the whole bloody lot of you.	spk_260

First of all, I want to pass my condolences to his family and, indeed, to all of his friends and colleagues and all the people who admired him for almost 30 years on Kerry radio. In the past few nights, I have been around different parts of the county and everyone is so saddened by his passing. He was a giant among journalists. His interpretation and analysis of what was going on politically was listened to and adhered to because people believed in him. He was honest. He had his homework done. He had amassed a vast amount of political knowledge going back to the foundation of the State. He knew where everyone came from and what they started out in. He knew where the political clout really lies at all times. He knew, as he used to say, ""the corridors of power"" and he always reported what was going on there. This world will be a lesser place for his departure. I, too, want to acknowledge his visit to Kilgarvan on the death of my father because he was there for the three days. We looked up to him before that, but we are looking up to him since and we will be looking up to him forever. As has been said, he may be gone but his voice will live on. As I say, he was one of the best Kerrymen who ever came out of Kerry. We are so proud of him. We are so proud to have known him. We thank him for the massive amount of work that he put in in amassing the knowledge that he had about political life in Kerry and in Ireland, and maybe far beyond."	spk_27
Danny HealyRae	71	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2024-02-20	dail	33	Paediatric Orthopaedic and Urology Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_12	I am glad to get the opportunity to speak and I, too, thank Sinn Féin for bringing this very important motion here before us tonight. I actually raised the issue of scoliosis and funding almost two years ago with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin. He actually got very agitated and cross when I had asked him because he had made an announcement of €5 million. This was a number of months afterwards because people were still ringing because their children were in pain, they were waiting and they wanted approval to go abroad. There were not being facilitated and, like has been said, a child or anyone in pain, whoever it is, has to be sorted out first. We have seen again this week where the Government’s priorities are totally wrong, where it was able to fund €800,000 for pets from another country and to provide housing for them and we have children of our own languishing here waiting for some consultant who is on some type of leave. If we have no orthopaedic surgeon or if there are no surgeons, these 327 children who are waiting now should be treated abroad and this should funded with taxpayers’ money. I make no apology for using taxpayers’ money to do that because that is most important. These are the issues we should be dealing with and not the nonsense. I am appealing to the Minister of State and I appreciate what she has done on other occasions.Regardless of the senior Minister, I am asking the Minister of State to ensure we sort out this problem and that these people up here, good people who have children suffering belonging to them, do not have to come in once more. They were outside the gates this evening and it is hard enough for them to mind their children, let alone to see them suffering agony. Some of these children, if they are not treated today, will outgrow the treatment that could be done for them. Seconds, minutes and hours are vital in cases like this which can end fatally if children are not seen in time. We should join together, regardless of what politics or none, and ensure this problem is sorted out once and for all. I see in some part of the Minister's report that he wants to set up a task force, but I say to hell with the task force. The Minister should sort out the problem.	spk_194
Danny HealyRae	71	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2024-02-20	dail	33	Defective Building Materials	dbsect_26	This is to discuss the long-awaited N22 Killarney bypass from Lissyviggeen to Farranfore and from Lissyviggeen to Castlelough on the Muckross Road, the N70, and that this be prioritised to be progressed in this year's programme. I attended the Oireachtas transport committee last Wednesday evening and when I asked Peter Walsh, a senior official of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, whether this project was on the programme, I learned from him that it was not on the national development plan for 2024. To say the least, the people of Kerry are very disappointed with this utterance from this man. It is in this context that I am raising this issue with the Minister of State again tonight. Many people are disappointed, including Kerry County Council and the TII officials locally in Kerry who have been trying to progress this scheme for many years. This scheme, the Killarney bypass, has been on the table for 24 years since 2000. A route was selected in 2004 and was presented to the public in the Great Southern Hotel in that year. It was dropped because of the downturn in 2008 until I started raising it again here in the House when I was elected around 2016. Because of the delay, TII decided that it should go out for public consultation again, identifying four new possible routes in 2021 and one was to be selected in April 2022.  Councillor Maura Healy-Rae raised this issue again last Monday with Kerry County Council and the reply given by the council was that the N22 Farranfore to Killarney scheme was at phase 2, options, selection stage. The draft options selection report was peer-reviewed by Transport Infrastructure Ireland in October 2022 and TII requested that additional work, including the further appraisal of all tenders, including combinations of road and non-road solutions, active travel and public transport modes which could potentially meet the scheme objectives and confirm the Climate Action Plan 2023 requirements be undertaken. This was ordained by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan. TII allocations are awaited and will determine whether the option selection phase can be completed or not in 2024.  In addition, Kerry County Council have procured consultants to prepare an area-based transport assessment for Killarney and work is under way. Some €500 million to €800 million is required to allow this project to go ahead, to allow for the planning and development of our county and to assist our tourism, industry, commercial transport and, indeed, farming. Our town of Killarney has been clogged for the past number of summers, evening after evening. Above all, this is for the safety of all who use this road. There are 24,000 vehicular movements daily, six dangerous junctions intersecting on this current N22 primary road, and many lives have been lost here. To give back the unwanted three routes to landowners who have had their land effectively sterilised for many years, I am appealing to the two Kerry Government TDs, Deputy Griffin and the Minister, Deputy Foley, to use their influence at this critical and crucial time. This is their time; this is our time. When Jackie Healy-Rae was in the position he held and when the Government was depending upon him, he used his influence. I am asking those two Deputies to use their influence now to ensure that we get for the people of Kerry what they rightfully deserve.	spk_297

It is up to that body and I am sure it will perform once the Government gives it the funding. No money, no fun. That is where we are now. So many people have done so much work over a long number of years.

First of all, one size does not fit all. Increasing the VAT for restaurants, pubs and some hospitality sectors is not fair. Many of them are crying like they never cried before, especially in places like Killarney, where footfall is falling because of an increased number of beds in hotels in that sector being handed over to asylum seekers and refugees. Some 36% of the bed nights have gone to those. Places like Killarney have to be treated specially to reduce the VAT to 9% and do something about the rates. The other sector that I am very worried about is small and medium-sized enterprises. It is grand to afford the employees extra sick days. I believe it has been five up to now and it will be ten next year, but how will the employers keep going? Yes, I was an employer myself. People have to try to pay fellows on Friday evening. The Government cannot bring in laws that will help one and crucify the other. Friday evening comes very quick if you have people to pay and families depending on you.

For too long, they had not been agreeing or working but we are glad it is happening now. I appreciate both sides - Sinn Féin and the DUP - coming together. We wish Michelle O'Neill all the very best as First Minister, and give our best wishes to the DUP as well. We hope they continue to work together. Similar to those we represent down here, people from every sector of the community there have been disenfranchised. In the North, that results from the inability to access funds from the UK. They have been promised more than £3 billion and we hope they get the required funding. They say they need more but let them operate with what they get first and then let the DUP and Sinn Féin fight for more together. We welcome that all communities, whether they are Catholic or Protestant, will now reap the benefits of the Good Friday Agreement. They are entitled to that. They have suffered for long enough. It is good that the children of today do not have to go through what their parents and grandparents went through for many years up there. We are glad that children do not have to go through the bloodshed and mayhem that was once the order of the day. We wish them very well.

What the Government is actually proposing to do to people that have to travel in motor cars day in and day out is the height of blackguarding. It wants to reduce the speed limit on the road from Mallow to Rathmore to Killarney and back around the Ring of Kerry from 100 km/h down to 80 km/h. It wants people driving up against each other and rear-ending each other. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, they will be frustrated morning, noon and night. It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest doing this. I accept there are things wrong. The Minister must recognise that there is a massive increase in the volume of traffic on our roads and to deal with that we have to increase the capacity and adjust our roads to make them safer. Dangerous junctions are not being addressed. If there is a pond of water, when it is late at night and there is a car coming against you, you cannot see where you are going and you drive into it. Trees are falling down on people. A branch fell on someone in a car this year and killed them. What we should do about that now is cut the trees and make sure that no tree is within falling distance of the road but the response is to increase penalty points and reduce the speed limit. They are great lads all right. Fianna Fáil is listening to this and they are going to support it. That is what they are doing. We could be educating our youngsters who have started to go on the road and do a lot more with them. We could teach them and show them the wrongs and the rights. The Government should be doing more about that. The Killarney bypass has been stalled. It has been going on for 24 years. At the present time there are six dangerous junctions where people have been killed, maimed and slaughtered, yet the Government will not put the new bypass around it so that these junctions would not be dealing with the current levels of traffic. It is because the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, wants people cycling. He does not want people on roads. He does not want to build roads. He does not want to improve them or do anything to help the people. A very serious thing is happening that we all hear about every day. It is when someone is trying to turn right and there is a line of cars behind them because there is a line of cars coming against the first car and it cannot turn right. The next thing is that some fellow who is four or five cars back comes up and the fellow who was at the front trying to turn right is blown away by a car because he does not know what is happening. That needs to be addressed. I gave an idea to the RSA a few years ago on how to resolve the problem. What the cars behind the car turning right should all be taught to do is to put on their right indicator so that everyone in the line knows that someone is turning right. It was a bus driver who told me that. The RSA is not doing anything about that. What it is going to do is increase the penalty points and reduce the speed limits. That is absolutely ridiculous. The Government is doing nothing but blackguarding. The sooner it is put out of this place the better. The people are waiting for them, whether they come on a bike or in a car.	spk_170

I believe we are putting the cart before the horse. As I understand it, RTÉ came to the Oireachtas committee to look for approximately €60 million to keep going, and that is only some of it. We have no plan or transparency available from RTÉ or the Government as to what is going to be the case with RTÉ going forward. We have to talk about the people who have been taken to court day after day to pay the licence fee, and for what? Yes, we get good current affairs and news from RTÉ, but there are also a lot of deficiencies. I do not watch television much but when we saw what was on television on Christmas Day, it was black and white films that were 80 years old. God Almighty, who gave them to RTÉ? It did not have to pay for them. We need transparency as to what is going on. We cannot see matches and we do not see enough culture, such as Irish music and dancing, or we see too little of it. Whatever wing TG4 is under, it is well run and is providing good entertainment, and it is where we see most of the matches.We can see the Begleys from west Kerry playing the accordion. We can see something real. RTÉ, however, is looking for €60 million while at the same time it is giving the likes of Joe Duffy €400,000 and Ray D'Arcy another €400,000. That is almost €1 million. It has to stop. We know what Joe Duffy tried to do to the good people of Killorglin and the Puck Fair in 2022. He failed, however. The crowd was even bigger this year.	spk_213

Over 35% of hotel beds in the town of Killarney are being taken up by refugees. People in Killarney, and all Kerry people, worked together for almost 150 years to bring the tourism product to where it was. However, as a result of a shortage of beds there has been a serious reduction in footfall. Many small restaurants, pubs, coffee shops and craft shops are struggling. In Killarney, six such businesses have already closed, as well as four in Killorglin and more in many other places. I ask the Government to address this serious situation immediately. On housing, I ask for a very serious anomaly to be addressed. A local Killarney or Kerry person seeking to rent a private house will only get HAP or RAS from the State, which many homeowners will not entertain. Householders will get €800 per month tax free for housing Ukrainians. Local Kerry and Irish people do not have a hope of competing with that. I want the same tax exemption to apply to our own people who are trying to rent. There is no homeless centre in Killarney; homeless people have to go to Tralee. I do not have to say who is in that centre now. I know the law on social welfare payments is changing for refugees who arrive here from now on. All of those who have arrived until now receive the same social welfare payments as Irish people, and we have been told they have all received a medical card and all of the entitlements that come with that. Many local people, even those who are sick and in need of a medical card, do not qualify for one. I want the same benefits and conditions to be made available to Irish people. They should all get the same ophthalmology and dental treatments. For as long as I can remember, in order to qualify for free school transport a child had to be living more than two miles from the nearest primary school. This is not the case for Ukrainian children. They are all brought by school transport to national schools and there is no limit on distance. They get free transport. Secondary school students in Killarney have been travelling to Killorglin for years and do not qualify for free school transport. There are 11 Ukrainian children on one bus. I asked that 13 children from Killarney also be allowed to travel in order to fill the 24 seats on the bus, which was organised by the Minister for Education, but my request was turned down. I want our own people and children to get the same consideration as anyone else when it comes to school transport.	spk_273

Do not any one of you over there or over here behind me say that I have any gripe with any of them. The gripe I have is with the Tánaiste and the Government. If the Government is able to give €800 tax free to one section of society, it should be able to do it for the others as well. Irish people, Kerry people, cannot compete for a private house when the house owner is going to get €800 tax free. How could that be fair? On the other issues, I have no spite in the world for the Ukrainian people or no gripe at all to tease out with them. It is with the Government. I want the same conditions applied across the board with regard to the medical card and school transport. It is happening.

I welcome the debate but, sadly, I cannot support the Bill. I worry so much about the evidence regarding drugs and what they are doing to youngsters, lovely young boys and girls, and how families are broken up and people finish up in bad health. We can see that cannabis use has been on the rise for nearly two decades. While some of the people in favour of the Bill will say that it is not a serious or bad drug in itself, it is the gateway and stepping stone to harder drugs. I have heard the medical profession say that there are more people adversely affected by cannabis than any other drug because there is more of it being used. The with me in Kerry, the Acting Chairman knows that in Mayo and everywhere else it is on the rise in every little town, hamlet and parish. We see the devastation it is creating. I cannot support this Bill because I see what is involved. I know what it is to bring up children and I see my children bringing up their children. I know what is invested in children's lives in trying to get them going. This is not right, and I cannot support this Bill. It would damage people's health or lead them to harder drugs. I ask that more education about the ill effects of drugs be made available, especially in secondary schools. Like Deputy Michael Collins, I support the use of medicinal cannabis for that purpose, where it is regulated.	spk_39

I agree with and welcome much of it. The amalgamation of the science foundation and the Irish Research Council, combining their respective remits, is welcome but I hope there will be more funding for innovation and higher education because our youth today are our future tomorrow and our greatest asset. We must do everything we can to ensure they avail and probe every opportunity to get ahead. Youth change their minds. Even people in here change their mind practically every hour, not to mind every day. Youth being youth, they change their minds and we must give them scope to do that. We must ensure there are jobs and apprenticeship places for them. I have come across a good few cases where a young fella with so much of the apprentice time given in a trade then needs hours in a college but is told he has to wait nine or ten months until the next year to get a place in the college. That is not right. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that does not continue to happen. It has been happening in my area. In the past year, at least three or four of these people have had to wait nine or ten months to get a place in the college for the trade they are following, because there is no course available to them. It pinched me a lot and I made representations about it but it still happens from time to time and it should not happen. Jobs and all that are fine but I am not exaggerating when I say an awful lot of young people are leaving our shores, including last week a lovely young fella from Bonane. They were in their last round-up together and went on a bus tour because he is leaving and trying Australia to see if things are any different or better there. I had a select group of people from Clare visit the bar during Christmas. They all had jobs and were 26, 27, 28 or 30, and the eldest was 31 years of age. The problem they had was whatever job they had - teacher, guard or whatever - they could not see a possibility of providing a home for themselves. They had good jobs. The trouble is it is so hard and expensive to provide a home that most of them have decided to emigrate.  More than a third of the cost of a house goes on taxes and levies. The other thing as far as Kerry and the Killarney area is concerned is you cannot get planning permission, even if you were prepared to go to the extreme and extravagant cost of buying or building a house.  That is the most serious thing. We must address those issues. I am not scaremongering but we have lost an awful lot of our youth from Gneevgullia, Rathmore, Scartaglin, Killarney, Fossa, Kenmare, Bonane and all around us. Lads of 25, 26 and 27 years of age cannot see a way to provide a home for themselves like the people who came before them. I ask the Minister of State to be cognisant of that and to do something about it. 	spk_180

The same cow and bull that have a four or a five star rated calf last year will only have a two or a three star rated calf next year. That is the silly change that has been made. The bulls being elevated to the top of the replacement index will have a major negative impact on both the carcass weight and the weaning weight that farmers can produce. This, in turn, affects farm viability and the quality aesthetics of Irish beef farmers. These changes are a failure resulting from non-communication and a failure of governance.

I took them to Belfast to get their eyesight restored and I would do it for all those people who have been here for many years. However, we have to recognise that there is a place called ""Stop"". When you overflood and concentrate a lot of people in one area, a community will be upset. A few months ago, before people came to the Harmony Inn on the Muckross Road in Killarney, I asked the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman to come down and meet with a deputation from a meeting that took place in the East Avenue Hotel attended by more than 350 people who had concerns. When we talk about the Harmony Inn, I can say it was anything but a place in harmony because I am being told day after day that Garda cars are outside of it.When people from all over the world are put into 22 rooms, you will have conflict.

Why is it not getting involved? I am also disappointed with the United States. It should be putting on more pressure. It seems to be aligned closely with Israel, and has been for many years. I suppose going back to the Second World War, they have kind of been together. It is time it stopped. When a person loses their life that is the end of it. There is no coming back.

The Killarney bypass is otherwise known as the Cork-Kerry economic corridor. Gladly part of that was opened between Baile Bhuirne and Macroom, but our side of it from Farranfore to Lissivigeen and from Lissivigeen to Castlelough on the Muckross Road is a vital project to help alleviate the traffic jams on the Killarney bypass we have now. There are 23,000 vehicle movements each day on that at the height of the season, and it may be more at times. It is choking our town of Killarney.Imagine all the traffic that comes down from Moll's Gap, from the Cork side and the Bantry side as far back as Castlecove on the Ring of Kerry and back then from Berehaven and Castletownbere. All that traffic is brought in from the Muckross Road. It goes around Kenmare Place choking the whole area. There is traffic there that has no business going to Killarney, because they have business further up the county, such as in Tralee and elsewhere. They have no business whatsoever coming in there. There is the fact that six dangerous junctions are being impacted by the loss of this bypass. There is the like of Ballykissane, where we have been calling for a roundabout. There are so many things involved here. There is Madam's Hill, the Kilcummin junction and the junction at Farranfore. There is mayhem there where people are trying to access the N22 coming from Firies and as far west as Dingle. All that traffic is trying to get onto that road. Currow and Scartaglen are on the other side. People have been killed at this junction. We have been trying to get this bypass advanced for at least 24 years. There was a big hullabaloo back in 2003 or 2004 in the Great Southern Killarney. The plans were shown. They were wonderful plans. Now, that is all at a standstill. It is in abeyance. Even TII does not have the funding to show us the preferred route. Four routes have been discussed in the past number of years. Much planning and development are being held up because of this hold-up and because of the fact that TII cannot come up with the route that was going to be sanctioned because they do not have the funding. The Minister for Transport stopped that this year. It was supposed to proceed but it was cancelled. We are waiting. There is a great TII team working out of Castleisland. They are doing their very best. I refer to people like Paul Neary and several genuine men who have been there for years. This project has been held up. We deserve fair play like everyone else. Likewise, there are the treatment plants. There are no treatment plants in so many of our towns and villages that have been left behind. Our communities cannot progress until they get the basic rights that are needed to help them get planning in order that they can build homes and put a roof over their heads. These things are hurting the people of Kerry. I am asking the Minister of State to address them as soon as possible.	spk_150

Renters in many parts of Kerry are having severe difficulty finding a house to rent. The houses that are available may be too expensive. Landlords are sceptical of the HAP system and unwilling to accept the payment. There are houses to be found but many landlords have left the market because they can only get €700 or €800 a month in rent for the property and they would pay half of that in tax. Another problem is that the RTB will ensure landlords who need the house back will not be able to get it back. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who is present, is aware that landlords or house owners who rent a house to a Ukrainian family get €800 tax free from the Government. We are now aware these people are not going to be kept in hotels endlessly, so where are they going to finish up? Invariably, they will be looking for landlords to rent houses to them and they will have an advantage. I am asking the Minister of State to ensure our people get that same tax relief. Landlords who rent a house to a local person should be able to get up to €800 tax free, just like those who rent to Ukrainians. I want the same deal for local people. I am making no bones about it. Our people are entitled to the same terms and conditions as other people, whatever part of the world they come from. There is still very little progress on voids being brought back into existence in Kerry, as I told the Minister of State a few days ago. The tenant purchase scheme was a great scheme. Local authority houses built since 2015 cannot be purchased by the tenant. I am asking the Government to change that. It was a great scheme. People who were allocated a house by the local authority kept it well because it was in their mind to purchase the house when they got on their feet. That was a great scheme but it is being ended now. There are a lot of voluntary housing bodies building houses but the tenants will never be able to purchase those houses. Tenants do not have the same pride when they know they will never be able to purchase the house. An important point is that we are housing people from all over the world in Killarney but there is no homeless centre in the town. If a person in Killarney becomes homeless, the nearest homeless centre for that person is in Tralee. That takes people away from local schools, family and everything else. It is too far away. I need the Government to address that important issue. We always used to have a facility in Killarney but have not had one for the past 12 months. On planning, there is no possibility of getting planning in most of Kerry unless you are the son or daughter of a farmer. While I welcome that those people can get planning, there are other local people who should be getting planning as well. They should have the basic right to build a house and put a roof over their heads.	spk_179

We welcome people here for whatever reason they come but there has to be a place called Stop when they have an impact on our own services. Clearly, Kerry County Council has indicated we do not have the services to take any more because they are having an impact on the services of our own people. The first thing that has to happen when people come here, regardless of the country they are from, is vetting within a short space of time. They should have to give their credentials. If people from war situations are to get a PPS number, as has happened – we are talking about Ukrainians – they should have to undergo an assessment, just as all the Irish people here have to undergo when they want to get social welfare, a medical card or any other benefit, even school transport. We have a two-mile rule for picking up children. They have to be from beyond two miles of the school to get the free school transport. That does not apply to children from Ukraine. Seeing as the Government can give free transport to children from within two miles of a school, or not more than a half mile away, it should provide the same service to local children. There has to be fair play. If the Government is going to continue with the system, Irish children must get the service and be assured of the same deal as anybody from anywhere else in the world. We must apply a cap, belatedly as it may be, because it is clear that if we are to take care of the people coming here, and certainly take care of our own people, we cannot take any more at present. I asked the Taoiseach a number of days ago to reduce the rates of social welfare and benefits. He said we could not. I also asked him whether we could have a uniform rate of social welfare across the European Union. He said we could not. I cannot see how that is right, because we have to have a level playing field all across Europe. Many more seem to be coming here than elsewhere although Ireland is the farthest from Ukraine, is an island and is harder to get to. Therefore, we need to level the pitch, and the Government needs to argue in Europe that the same rates of social welfare should apply across the board. Our people need to be treated the very same as the Ukrainian people. The latter get the same social welfare rates and get fed and housed. They also get school transport and free postage. One thing that hurt me very much at a time when I was looking for a special wheelchair for a person who has been incapacitated in Ireland for a long time was that I saw a vanload of game chairs for Ukrainian children inside in a post van. That is the gospel truth. Our children are getting no game chairs. If the Government is to continue doing that, it will have to give them to our children as well. The Ukrainian people get hairdressers, offering all kinds of dos, and they get shoes and clothes. There is even a secondary school bus taking Ukrainian children to Killorglin from Killarney. The Irish Killarney children have to pay for a bus to take them to Killorglin. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If the Minister, Deputy Foley, is going to give free transport in every situation to children who come here, that is fine, but she should have to give it to our children as well. That is what I am asking for. How is it that Georgia emerged as a leading country of origin for applicants in 2022, constituting one application in every five despite the Department of Justice designating Georgia as a safe country of origin? All we want is fair play. That is what we are asking for here today.	spk_32

This means we will have to slaughter 40,000 heavily-in-calf cows this coming year because there is no other market for them, and 160,000 in the next four years. Farmers will have reduced incomes, and smaller farmers will become unviable. Tim Herlihy, from Inches in Rathmore, has 58 cows now. He worked hard to bring his herd up to this figure. He has told me that his adviser has told him that he will have to reduce this number to 48. This is because he cannot rent or buy any more land, as it is too expensive. This is the first time in history the farmers of Ireland have been compelled to cull their cows. If we do reduce production, it does not follow that consumers will reduce their consumption, unless the Government can organise a hunger strike worldwide. The consumers, though, will have to get their food somewhere else, and it does not matter to the Government whether it is from Brazil, Argentina or New Zealand. The Government does not mind as long as it can get the figures here down. But we are all under the same sky, so surely if we are talking about the climate and carbon emissions, then it should also matter if the other crowd are also increasing and creating more emissions. Has the Government ever heard of such a thing as sequestration? The Government is telling the farmers of Ireland that it cannot measure the sequestration of carbon until 2027, or later. At the same time, however, the Government is hell-bent on reducing the cow numbers this year because Eamon Ryan wants it to and the members of the Government are under his apron. For the Taoiseach and for Micheál Martin to stay in power, as well as the rest of ye, they will sell the farmers of Ireland. Do they know what is happening in the rest of the world? I had to go over to the USA for a couple of days last week for a funeral. There are the biggest of vehicles. There are roads over you, under you and up and down beside you with six lanes on all sides of you. All these vehicles, the biggest of vehicles, are all petrol; eight-litre petrol engines. Germany is mining new coal mines. China is building hundreds of coal-burning power stations. I certainly know you do not have to have AdBlue in India. Turning to water quality, and surely this is what this is about, why is the Government not so interested in doing something about the hundreds of treatment plants in settlements around County Kerry, and areas around the country that have no treatment plant?They are polluting the water. If all of us evaporated from the country tonight, it would only make 0.13 of 1% of a difference worldwide. This is the torture the Government is putting the people through for the sake of Eamon Ryan and staying in power and for no other bloody reason. That is what you are at. It is driving the farmers and the people of Ireland down through the ground. That is what the Government thinks of them.	spk_32

It is very clear to me that neither the Taoiseach, Micheál Martin or Charlie McConalogue put up any real fight to stop this. Consumers will have to get food. There are a million more people in Ireland. I hope the Government is not thinking of slaughtering some of them. I would not trust the Government if Eamon Ryan asked it to do it. The cow is the easy option. What about the treatment plants? The Government is making no attempt in the world. This has been going on since I came up here in 2016. I and others in the House have raised this issue. There has been no difference or improvement. Kenmare is waiting. Currow and Scartaglen do not have any. Castleisland is waiting for an extension. It is an issue all over the county. Knocknagashel and Brosna do not have treatment plants. The waters are being polluted. What is the difference in polluting water from bad treatment plants? The Government has said the cattle are doing it, but I doubt that very much. Farmers are the first target. Many young farmers will not take over farms because they cannot bear the villainisation and criticism farmers are getting. They are being blamed for the whole thing.

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-12-05	dail	33	Renters: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_21	I heard Deputy Tóibín say it takes eight months for the local authority to turn around a house where he comes from. To make a point I have raised several times before, there are many houses, even in the Killarney electoral area, that have been void and vacant for four and five years. That is the gospel truth. I was made promises in this regard the year before last, last year and this year. Whatever is the matter, there are still several homes vacant and void, and no notice in the world is being taken of them. The neighbours are even complaining that vermin are going in and out of one of these houses and the briars are growing over the wall into their own place. This is not fair or right when people are looking for houses. Another problem is that it is not possible to get contractors to turn these houses around. The Minister of State must accept that what the Department gives to turn around a house is €11,000, and if the house was done up in the last six years, it gives nothing. At the same time, if a house needs considerable work, that could cost up to €70,000 to go far enough to get the proper building energy rating, BER. The local authority has to foot this bill and it does not have the money. Maybe this is what is wrong. Some of these houses are going to take a lot of money to renovate. There is a problem that has not been sorted out and I do not think it is going to be sorted out given the way the system is.  On private renters, I have told the truth about the situation between Kenmare and Killarney. I gave a figure of about 55 houses that people will not rent out because the rental return they would get would be about €700 to €800 monthly. By the time they would pay the tax on that, they would only be left with only half that amount, maybe €350 or €400. That is one problem. It would not pay them to rent out these houses because they would have to pay for insurance, refurbishment or anything that might go wrong in the meantime. There is a bigger issue, however. If people wanted to get a rented house back, it would be almost impossible to do so. The crowd the Government thinks is helping the situation, the RTB, is actually making the story way worse. I met a man from east Kerry in Killarney the other night. He told me he had finally got his house back and had sold it. He said he would have put up with everything but he would not put up with the RTB. That organisation must be looked at and scrutinised to see what it is doing. It is not being fair. It does not even help the people renting either, when it comes right down to it. It is not being fair and it is not helping the situation because it is not providing houses for people or providing a proper rent structure. The system has been changed. We had the tenant purchase scheme previously but local authorities are now precluded from selling any house built since 2015 to the tenant. It is likewise with the voluntary housing associations. Tenants cannot purchase those houses. Back in time, when people got tenancy of a house from the county council, they always looked forward to purchasing the house down the road when they got enough money together and got their funding straightened out. People took a special pride in the house while they were renting it because it was in their minds that they would own it one day. They kept doing it up and kept it right. That incentive is not there anymore because the Government has changed the system. I do not approve of it. Many people are saying to me that they would prefer if they could own their house someday. The money these people would use to pay for the house and to buy it out would be going into the coffers again. Kerry County Council used to use that money to do up voids, which kept the cycle kicking over all the time. We did not have voids like that in the past.I cannot understand why we should have them now. We should not because there are people looking for them. There is no homeless centre in Killarney. Yet, we are housing people from all over the world in hotels, guesthouses and what have you. Our own people who become homeless in Killarney have to go to Tralee, to the Whitehouse. That is the gospel truth. That is what is happening in Killarney. People are very upset in Killarney at the present time. The income cap is an issue. Deputy Fitzpatrick described a situation whereby a person's income was not enough to obtain a mortgage but it was too high for them to be on the local authority housing list. A fellow came in to me the other evening. He is bringing home €880, outside of tax. What he was offered by a bank by way of a mortgage facility was €96,000. Where is he going? Any house, even those that are not right, costs €200,000. He has not a hope of buying a house. At the same time, he cannot go on the local authority housing list. He has a partner and a little girl and would like to do something about a house, but they are up against it. I hope the Minister of State can understand the concern I have for those people. The HAP scheme is so intricate and involved that any landlord who would like to rent a house says, when asked whether they will take HAP, there is no way in the world they will. They will not have it. There are too many restrictions and things go on for two or three months. It does not help those looking to rent a house or the man who owns the house. Planning is now almost impossible to obtain in Kerry. People, even family members and farmers, cannot access national roads. Many are still waiting and hoping that something will change and they can build a house and come out onto the roads where they have always come out. People are staying at their parents, but they want to have their own homes with their partners and children. Other areas are deemed to be under what is known as severe restricted urban pressure. A farmer will get permission. A young fellow living beside him who does not have land could buy a site but will not get planning permission for a house. He could be from the very same place. Even ten miles east of Killarney, that is the situation. There are large tracts around every town for which people cannot get planning. They are asking us for nothing. They will pay for the house, whether that involves getting a mortgage, getting money or working for it, and put it together, but they cannot get planning in their own place. That is a very serious issue. I did not see the programme on television last night, but what is happening is very wrong. We are paying An Taisce and other environmental groups. We are funding them and they can obtain the best barristers and legal advice to prevent ordinary people from getting planning. That is not fair. That is happening. I see the Minister shaking his head, but it is happening. They have the funds to keep objections going and have many things stopped. The taxpayer is funding them to do just that and to keep them going. It is very unfair. I ask the Minister to listen to the things I have said. I have made nothing up. It is the gospel truth of what is happening in Kerry. We have serious problems there which can be addressed if you go to the bother of doing it.	spk_422

Will the Taoiseach ensure the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, meets the delegation because its members are concerned and want to raise their concerns with him. They are also concerned that another premises is being prepared for more people. Engagement is needed and I ask the Taoiseach to ensure the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, meets the delegation from the Muckross Road and that area of Killarney.	spk_83

I also condemn what happened after. These people are not deserving to be named as some kind of political category by affording them or calling them the far right. I call them thugs and blackguards, which is what they are. This is the worst kind of thuggery and they are the worst kind of blackguards. I have been called out inside in this Chamber tonight and all I will say for now is that I will continue to represent the communities I have been elected to represent, regardless of what is thrown at me inside here. Maybe the Government is not listening enough on certain issues such as healthcare, housing, immigration and policing. We have to appreciate our gardaí for the great work they do. I ask the Minister if the gardaí are operating with one hand tied behind their backs. It seems to me that many questions have been asked. Are they allowed to draw their batons or are they not in a case like this? We have seen a fine man in the middle of O’Connell Street, a garda, and he had to back away from them. I remember a time when there was a garda in Killarney, a sergeant, and he kept law and order. He was not afraid to put people in their place and people respected him for what he did. We are not respecting the gardaí now. I am asking the Minister as well if there were 90 gardaí here somewhere close to O’Connell Street. Perhaps they were up around here with four horses at their disposal. Why were they not allowed to go down in O’Connell Street?	spk_232

I am very sad and sorry to see this proposal being brought forward by the Tánaiste, Micheál Martin. I cannot understand it. He is undermining all the good works of the Defence Forces and their peacekeeping efforts over the years when we were applauded. The triple lock has served us well and I cannot understand how this can be gone back on. Back in 2013 Fianna Fáil argued with Fine Gael when it wanted to do away with the triple lock. If we want to remain neutral, I cannot understand we have to remove the triple lock now. As a young fellow, I remember listening to Raidió Éireann, when we had only radio, on different occasions to de Valera making the speech where Ireland wanted to remain neutral. I applaud him for that and for standing up to the English. He said we were oppressed for over 800 years and the British wanted us to go into the war. I applaud him for standing up to the might of the US and the UK at that time. This is very dangerous. No consideration is being given to the forces that we have at present because that was never in their contract. The Government will have to change their contract. As an employer, I know that if the contract is changed, it will have to pay people and get their agreement and understanding to do that, and the Government has not done that.	spk_274

People are outraged at what is going on and what has gone on. We welcome the word that has come through this morning that there is some breakthrough and that peace may be about to happen. We all hope and pray that it does happen. I condemn what has happened here since 7 October. I am neutral in the sense that we cannot go in there. We do not have powers for the Army to intervene. I believe that all this House can do is call for peace and appeal to all sides to end this conflict, which is creating such a loss of life. We all feel for Emily Hand and her father and all the other people who have been kidnapped. They must be released by Hamas and, likewise, Israel must cease the military action and the force it has used for a number of weeks now. As far as I can see, both sides are wrong. It has to stop when we see a group of dead babies together in a room somewhere. We all love children and look forward to seeing them grow up and become our future. What is happening, the numbers involved, is wrong. However, this motion does not mention the word ""peace"" or the kidnapping of Emily Hand. We all want peace. I do not support the reference in the motion to stopping American aeroplanes refuelling in Shannon. Do people think the US could not get petrol for its aeroplanes anywhere else? The planes can go to the North of Ireland, where we do not have any jurisdiction. We do not have any jurisdiction over what will happen in England. Shannon Airport is barely able to keep going. I had many joyous days there when I was welcoming family coming home and I had many lonesome days there when they were departing. It is an airport that is trying to keep going and I do not see why we should stop the activity given that the Americans will get the petrol somewhere else. I have not seen them doing any harm in all the years. It is just ridiculous to include-----"	spk_53

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-11-22	dail	33	Consultative Forum on International Security Policy Report: Statements	dbsect_15	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about this issue because I am very hurt and out of sorts about what is taking place on the Muckross Road in Killarney this evening. Seventy-seven single male asylum seekers have arrived. When we are talking about wars and conflicts we seem to be getting more men, whether they are refugees or asylum seekers. We do not know where the women are. Are they fighting the wars? I am being honest. We are talking about an international consultative policy and some forum. We need to have a national policy here to deal with the results of the conflicts all over the world. Killarney and Kerry have taken on their fair share of asylum seekers and refugees. We are full of them and we have enough of them. In case the Minister of State is not aware, after the asylum seekers arrived, a van came along with a load of e-scooters. Who paid for them? They did not pay for them anyway. It is the fellas who are working all over the country and are out early in the morning who are paying for them. The asylum seekers were landed in alongside a 94-year-old woman without any consultation whatsoever. I have been begging here for a week or more for the Minister or his team to go and talk to the residents of the Muckross Road. It has not happened. I asked that it happen before the asylum seekers arrived or before their arrival was contemplated. They have landed now, and the women and girls that used to walk the Muckross Road morning, noon and night will all stop doing that. They are worried about their safety. On top of that, the tourism economy of Killarney and Kerry is now being compromised on a daily basis. We need to sort out our own country first and sort out our own policies. There are more men coming than women. We cannot understand it.He brought over 400 of them to the Killarney hotel last year and they fought between themselves. We want to know where they are coming from. They have to be vetted. If someone was allocated a house inside in Killarney or any part of Kerry by Kerry County Council, they would not be left into it without being vetted-----	spk_303

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-11-21	dail	33	Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_14	I am glad to have the chance to speak on this important matter. The Bill is regarded as pivotal legislation in the ongoing effort to fine-tune risk equalisation credits and stamp duties within the private health insurance market. It does absolutely nothing, however, to reduce the cost of private health insurance. In fact, it is more about helping insurance companies than it is about doing anything to help people with the challenges of the affordabilty of health insurance or the escalating cost of the public healthcare system. As I have said before, insurance companies have been doing exactly what they like since Seán Quinn was forced out of the insurance market. He provided competition and made insurance available, even in the motor industry. He insured young fellas who were trying to get on the road and for whom insurance was unattainable before that. Likewise, he was helping in the private health insurance sector as well. The Bill does nothing to reduce the cost of private health insurance. The cost of the average adult policy has increased by at least 5% since last year. Year on year, it is going up 5%. Many people have contacted me to say that even if you have health insurance, you will have to wait six months to be seen, which is ridiculous. Even people with health insurance have to wait six months. We all know that cancer can go from stage 1 to stage 2, 3 or 4 very quickly if it is not challenged or treated. The sooner it is treated, the better. People who have tried to pay their way and who pay for the health insurance are not even being seen by a doctor. Something has to happen. We have all heard of people who have been found unconscious, brought by ambulance to a hospital and put on a ward. When they come around, it is invariably the case that the first question they are asked is whether they have health insurance. Maybe the Minister of State sitting opposite does not know why that question is asked. It is to ensure the HSE gets the maximum payment for each patient. The patient has to sign a form. Instead of the HSE getting €70 or €80 for each day of a stay in hospital, it can bill health insurance companies something like €800 to €900 a night for that patient. Is it any wonder health insurance is going up? It is all a merry-go-round. The HSE charges much more to the health insurance companies than it would if it was asking the private person to pay the bill, but the level of care does not go up. That is one of the reasons the cost of health insurance is increasing. Another reason, of course, is that there is no competition in the market. The private health insurance market, which opened to competition in 1994, features three major providers, VHI Healthcare, Laya Healthcare and Irish Life Health. Market data highlights 3% of growth in the market during 2022, with 79,553 more insured individuals compared with the previous year. The total premium income for 2022 reached €2.9 billion. As of June 2023, 47.6% of the population, or 2.46 million people, held health insurance, with the average adult policy priced at €1,509, reflecting a 5% increase this year. The tax relief in respect of health insurance resulted in €355.3 million of forgone taxes in 2019.In 2022, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare suggested phasing out this tax relief as part of the ongoing implementation of Sláintecare's healthcare reform recommendations. God almighty, when is enough enough? This is something that I and many TDs in the Minister of State's own party do not support. It has to be halted. Our group is adamant that the tax relief must remain because if not, many people will not be able to afford private health insurance. The Health Insurance Authority not only serves as the regulatory body overseeing the private health insurance market but it also gives essential advice to the Minister for Health on health insurance matters, including duty and the risk equalisation scheme. In a concerning trend, Irish Life has announced its third price increase in the past 12 months, with the latest surge of 4.8% to be implemented in January 2024. It is very clear that the health insurance system we have is not effective. There is not enough competition. The story is that health insurance is not helping people who even have it because they do not get any reward for having it. They have to wait six to 12 months, the same as people on the public waiting list. That is not right. I do not begrudge the people on the public waiting list. They must be seen after as well. However, the people who are paying are not getting any reward for it. I have another matter to raise with the Minister of State, of which he is likely to be aware. HSE management and administration-grade staff in the Fórsa trade union commenced industrial action on Friday, 6 October. Unfortunately, one of the areas affected is the processing and answering of parliamentary questions and representations. This is hurting me and every other public representative, especially in the area of home help. I had a simple request, on or about 7 or 8 October, related to a case where the woman of the house is seriously ill. The family has pulled out all the stops to try to assist her. She always got up between 8 a.m. and 8.30 a.m. She is after getting notification that the home help will not come to help the family member who is staying at home to get her out of bed until 11 o'clock and the home help will not come back again until 5 o'clock in the evening. What the family is saying is that spending this amount of time in bed is not good for her. The day is too long from the time she goes to bed in early evening until the time she gets up in late morning. It made a very simple request. Have I got an answer about the case since? No, and that is not fair. I am asking the Government to deal with whatever gripe, grudge or concern the staff have. They are saying they are not being recognised or being paid for the grade they are working for. There is another thing, and this is a fact. I will call it out one of these days if it is not sorted out. I have been reliably told something by the home helps, who will not leave, and I have to compliment them as they do their work so diligently. However, they have been told by their manager that they will not be paid for the overtime they have worked. They helped the people who went off sick by taking their places because they did not want to see the patients short-changed or not seen after. They went to help their comrades who were off sick or had to go somewhere. Then they were told by the manager that they were not going to be paid for the overtime. There has been a lot of talk in this Chamber about trying to keep people in their homes for as long as possible and they save the State a fortune when they do not go into hospitals. I am asking the Government to sort this out. It says it has funds and it gave the HSE more funds the other day. Someone has to be responsible and call them out for what they are not doing. They are not helping the patients and in the healthcare system in many parts of my county, people are being short-changed. I have a lot more to say. When the motion is discussed later on I will highlight a couple of other very serious issues because the care of our elderly people is of paramount importance.	spk_171

This motion is so important because our sick people and people with disabilities have been hurt by this embargo on filling positions, employing more home help workers and even funding the fair deal scheme. I place no blame on the Ministers of State but I blame the Minister for Health and the Government for the way they have behaved. The Government has a legal obligation as an employer and it has let down the health service in a big way. We have had a situation for weeks where there is an embargo on recruiting staff. We also have this issue where the Fórsa trade union has commenced industrial action since Friday, 6 October. We are making representations on behalf of people for home help and the fair deal scheme and that is not good enough. Whatever their gripe or situation is has not been sorted out by the Government or the Minister for Health. That should be sorted out. People are entitled to healthcare but they do not get it. They come to us, whether it is me or other councillors or whoever, and they expect us to come back to them. We cannot come back to them when there is no one coming back to us. We have a list as long as my arm and it is not good enough. We have a situation in certain areas in Kerry where home help workers are being told by their managers that they will not be paid for overtime. These home help workers are so good and conscientious that if one their comrades gets sick or has to go somewhere, be it to a family member or whatever, they fill the gap. However, they have been told by the managers that they will not be paid for overtime. That is not good enough. I will call out the managers who have done this if they do not change their ways because that is not fair. The home help workers are told that if they go to these people they will not be paid. That is not good enough. I have at least a half a dozen people who have gone to the hospital by ambulance. Invariably they are sent home in taxis even though they are not fit to come home, and that is not good enough. One particular woman, along with the other five cases, wanted to go into a home, and the HSE would not qualify them for the fair deal. They will not get home help and they will not qualify for the fair deal so what are they supposed to do? I say to the Ministers of State that there is no need for a Committee on Assisted Dying because if this is what the health service is allowing to happen, they will die anyway. When they are 85 or 86 years of age, if they want to go into the nursing home they are entitled to the fair deal scheme. I would ask the Minister for Health the following question if he was here. What is wrong? This never happened before during my time. The fair deal arrangement was always approved if the person was sick enough and old enough and had no way of staying at home. This is ridiculous.	spk_211
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-11-21	dail	33	Health Service Recruitment Freeze: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_15	I would appreciate that. I am not personalising anything but the Minister responsible need not walk out just because we were here. There is only one set of speakers after us and we deserve to be heard. He should listen to us the same as we had to listen to him. He made a speech at the start of the debate more or less saying there is nothing wrong with the health service. Well there is something wrong with it and that was proven when the health service was left €1 billion short, and maybe more. So many weeks after the budget it was decided to give the health service the money it needs and that it had suffered enough. People have died and have been suffering in the meantime. They cannot get home help. There is so much talk about how people will be helped to stay in their homes for as long as they are able and there is talk about how they will be assisted to do that. That is not happening in Kerry. The Government has to wake up to that. It is probably the same around the country but we certainly have a problem in Kerry and I have raised it since June 2022.	spk_213
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-11-21	dail	33	Nitrates Usage	dbsect_30	Will the Minister of State do everything possible to defer the new nitrates derogation regime which is reducing from 250 kg N/ha to 220 kg N/ha? I am asking that it at least be paused or deferred for a period of time. As the Minister of State would know, coming as he does from a country area, farmers get their cows and heifers in calf by July at the latest so that they will be calving from January onwards, through February and March, to meet the new season and catch the first grass that grows, and it was no different this year. Farmers had all of their cows and heifers in calf by the end of July at the latest, and then in September they were told this new regime would be coming into place from 1 January 2024. We can see the predicament many farmers are in now. There is no market at present for in-calf cows or heifers to be milked in the coming year because most farmers have their quota filled and their culled cows sold. They have the amount of cows they need so no one will be buying the extra cows or heifers, so there is only one place farmers can go with them. To keep the same amount of cows, farmers would have to buy or rent more land and that is just not possible for most of them. The only option they have is to send their heavily in-calf cows or heifers to the factory for slaughter. That is not a good thing to be asking farmers to do. It was never done in farming practices previously. Farmers never did that. They never sold in-calf cows that were close to calving or sent an in-calf heifer to the factory. That was never done here and I am asking the Minister of State to pull out all the stops to ensure it does not happen. Farmers are against the change to the derogation but it seems to be copper-fastened at this stage. The European Commissioner with responsibility for the environment is coming over here on Thursday and I ask the Government to pull out all of the stops and ensure this issue is explained to him. This is cruelty. It is inhumane to do this to cows and heifers that are heavily in calf. I am being contacted by farmers around Killarney, in Kerry, Cork, Tipperary and Limerick who cannot believe they are in this predicament. The Minister of State is from a country place and I appreciate his presence here to listen to my story because I know he will take it forward. I appeal to him to drive the point home to the Taoiseach, who is meeting the Commissioner on Thursday, and whoever else is meeting him. I ask that every effort be made to ensure there is a pause or a deferral so that farmers have a proper and fair chance to comply with the new regulations. When the change was announced in September, it was too late then because the cows and heifers were already in calf.	spk_325

It is unfortunate that, even as we speak, many farmers will go out of business in the next few years because their young fellas are not taking up dairy farming. They find it too difficult and the hours too long. The vilification of farmers and the cow is stopping young fellas from going into it. There is no encouragement. They feel like they are blamed for the rain, the heat and everything else. No other industry or anything else is tackled in the same way as the poor farmer and the cow farmers. There is no comeback on lads up in aeroplanes or whatever but the farmer is an easy target. Many farmers are going to go out of business. I was asked to say that the latest nitrates action programme has not been in place long enough to demonstrate we were gaining and improving. How many waterways have been damaged by local authorities or Irish Water? In the Lough Leane catchment area, where farmers are now being targeted by this, several treatment plants are not compliant and there are none at all in places like Scartaglin and Curra. It is very unfortunate that the finger is being pointed clearly at the farmer. The Minister's leader gave out to me for raising the issue of culling cows or suggesting that he would want to have cows culled. That is what is happening. I raised it more than two years ago. The only way out for farmers now is to cull cows. He has to admit that either he did not know what was happening or he knew but did not want to tell us. That is not fair on farmers, however. Farmers who got their cows in calf last July now have no option other than to send heifers that are heavily in calf into the factory. I am appealing to the Minister of State.

First of all, I stress that we are a neutral country and have to remain neutral. We all abhor and condemn what is going on in Gaza and Israel. It is transparent and we can see what is happening there. Hamas started it. It took hostages that it has not yet released. I ask it to return these people and free these hostages. The Israelis are responding. I believe they are using their significant weaponry, backed by the US, and are intent on clearing these people out of that place altogether. When one sees little babies huddled together in a heap in a room in a hospital and they are all dead, it is shocking.We have promoted the life of babies and the unborn going back further into time since I have been here. We really condemn the death of these babies. I ask that the UN peacekeeping force steps up its presence if both sides are not willing to stop. We have to condemn Hamas for being under hospitals. This is the excuse the Israelis are giving for bombing hospitals. Hamas should not be using sick people as a shield for itself. If we were in a fight-----	spk_39

I state in the loudest possible way in this Chamber that we must remain neutral but we must ask and do everything possible to ensure the war ends on a humanitarian basis because so many lives are being taken and lost. I will give an example. When I was a young fellow I used to be out late. I came around MacSwiney's corner in Kenmare at 3 a.m. one night to see two very good friends of mine fighting. One of them was being kicked on the ground because the other fellow was way bigger. It was my duty to get out and stop that fight. While they were two friends of mine, I had to part and separate them. This is what we should try to do on an international level. I condemn Biden because I believe he could stop it. One word from him and he could stop it. It is sad to think that so many lives are being lost. We have to consider our own people, Irish passport holders, who are stranded out there. We want to get them home safely out of it. I do not know what took them there in the first place or why anyone would go to that war-stricken zone. The hostages being held should be released immediately and this thing should be stopped.	spk_45

I am firmly pro-life. I am glad that I was born and am able to see this life. I am sad that that is not the case for so many little babies who have been conceived but will not see the light of day. All they are asking, I am sure, is that they be allowed to live and come into this world. They are being denied that chance or right. I am very sad that we are even talking about this matter at all because I love children. I have grandchildren and I love each and every one of them. I love my own children. I know that women can find themselves in a predicament, but there are plenty of ways to help them now, beginning with education. There are many avenues open to them. If they cannot see a way out, there are adoption services. There are people out there who would love to have a child but have not been able to do so. They would love to adopt children and take care of them. Doing so would mean much to them. It is sad that this is happening and that this Bill with its exclusion zones will compound what was introduced three or four years ago. The need for the three-day period for women to think about it has been stopped. When deciding about life or death, three days is not an awful lot to ask them to wait. In any one day, I could change my mind 50 times about one very important thing. The little baby that is waiting to come into the world should at least get that chance. It is such a small thing to ask for. Our little group asked for something else and put it to a vote in the Dáil, that being, to allow some form of pain relief. We know that in the abortion process, the babies suffer great pain. However, that was denied these little human beings, who only wanted to come into the world and did nothing wrong. The mother has rights, but every one of us must remember that the little baby has rights after being conceived.There are so many protections now. We need to educate young girls and advise them of all the protections and avenues open to them in order that they will not get pregnant in the first place. With regard to exclusion zones and depriving people of the right to protest or make their case, I have not heard of protests outside any hospitals. I would not be for it, but I do not believe there is a need for exclusion zones because we do not know who is going in and out. We do not actually know where the abortion clinics are. You could find yourself outside one and not be aware that you should not be there in the first place. Who has a map or diagram showing where the abortion clinics are? I do not have one. There is no need for the exclusion zones. I ask the Minister to reconsider and not to go ahead with this Bill because there is no need in the world for it. With regard to making a hospital like Fort Knox such that a person should not or may not go there, someone who is pro-life could be challenged for being in the hospital with somebody who is sick, or you could be sick yourself and find yourself challenged. That is not right or fair.	spk_254

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-11-14	dail	33	Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_10	I am glad to get the opportunity to speak. I thank the Electoral Commission for the great work it did and for leaving County Kerry intact and not putting any part of it into any other county. I have a small regret that there are small bits of Rathmore and of Ballydesmond in Cork North-West. They are part of their respective parishes and perhaps they could have been put into the Kerry constituency, but the Blackwater divides them and we have to accept that. Nevertheless, people from those places come to me, as well as some from farther away. I am glad to say I can work for people who are not from Kerry. I have done so and will continue to work for people no matter where they come from. I am glad to be in a position to do that. Perhaps Deputy Michael Collins should not have Dursey Island in the Cork South-West constituency. It is in the Kenmare River and it is part of Kilmackillogue harbour. I believe Dursey Island should be in with the Kerry constituency. I am an advocate of posters. We have to create some kind of atmosphere to get people interested in voting. At present we do not have posters in our towns and that is all right, but in the North of Ireland they are in the towns. It is part of our country, just above the Border and it is close to us. The other matter that is important is the electoral register. We have to ensure people are registered to vote. When children reach the voting age of 18 or whatever it will be, if they are in a secondary school or college, they should be helped and encouraged by their teachers to register. I welcome the new system. In the past, we had only two windows of opportunity to put our names on the register. The first was coming up to an election and there were only so many days after the election was called that people could register. That created an awful uproar with An Garda Síochána having to sign and stamp papers. That is no longer required which is no loss. That is not a reflection on An Garda Síochána, but it was cumbersome. People were afraid to go to the Garda stations to do it. The other window was from October to November, which was too short. People need to be reminded that they can now register all year and can even do so online. We appreciate that. The other gripe I have relates to housing. When the local authority allocates a house to someone who is on the register for some other electoral area, they have the person's PPSN and so on. Surely, it should be a matter of just putting that person on the register. The local authority should be able to do so. Many people who move into our county to live in a local authority house finish up not being on the register, even though they got a local authority house. The same should apply to voluntary housing run by Clúid or others. The approved housing bodies get their nominations from the local authorities. That is important. We need to create awareness and keep reminding people to put their names on the register. We all love working for them. We all want to be elected. I have done my level best for the number of years and days I have been here. The election is coming up and I ask the people of Kerry to come out and vote again for me, and for Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, to ensure we return. We also have three candidates running in the local elections next year so I ask the people of Kerry to keep us here and there because if they do, we will continue to work for them.	spk_129

Since I came up here, one of the things I have been consistently raising is the fact that we need more home helps and people need to be helped to stay in their homes as long as possible. They treat going into nursing homes as being the departure lounge and they feel they still have a chance if they stay at home. I thank our home helps for the wonderful work that they do. Some of them feel they are not being paid properly and that they are not being paid for overtime. The fair deal scheme is another area that I have a serious problem with at present. Elderly people who go into the hospital, maybe 13 or 12 times, and are sent back home in a taxi when they are clearly not fit for it. They want to go into nursing homes. I know at least half a dozen of them at the present time. The HSE will not sign off to give them the green light to go forward for the fair deal scheme. I am asking the Minister of State today whether there is enough funding for the fair deal scheme for the rest of the year. It seems to me that there is not. 	spk_38

It is very wrong that people, civilians and children, are being slaughtered there day after day and it is time to call a halt to that now. The European Union's migration stance significantly impacts smaller countries like Ireland. We are paying an awful price now for migrants. We have our share taken and like I said to the Taoiseach yesterday, there is a point at which we must call a stop to this because we are impacting severely on our own communities. The decision has been made to bring 70 more people to the Muckross Road in Killarney and people are up in arms. Elderly people, women and children are worried for their safety in this area and I said we have enough. There is a request being made continuously that the Israeli ambassador be sent home. I have a different viewpoint. I ask that this Israeli ambassador be seen after here and be kept here. Ask her to ensure the safety and return of our people who are out there in the Middle East.	spk_212

It is of paramount importance to me that the people from Ireland who are out there come home safely and whatever way the Government manoeuvres it, tell her that she is safe here while our people are safe over there. Pressure should be put on her and the Israeli Government to ensure the safe passage home of our people who are stranded out there. I do not know why ever they went out there, but people go to different places and that I suppose is their business, but that is not a safe place for them to be.

A total of 1,000 people or more are coming into the country every week. I am calling for a cap on that and for us to look after our own first. We are doing very little or not enough for people on the housing list. If they do get a council house or one from a housing body, they cannot purchase it any more. Everyone wants to buy out their home and they did so in the 1950s and 1960s. They all finished up buying out their houses and the money went back into the coffers. Nothing is being done for people in Kerry who want to build their own houses. First of all, they cannot get planning permission. A farmer's son or daughter can get planning permission, which I welcome, but nobody else can. The only place you can get planning permission for a site is in a town such as Killarney but you would pay €250,000 or €300,000 if you can get the site. The grandest man in the world contacted me in the past few days. He is bringing home nearly €900 per week. He went to Bank of Ireland for a loan but all it would give him was €90,000. It would take 35 years to pay it back and he would have paid €190,000 at that stage. How is that fair?  The Government is only giving grants of €11,000 to local authorities for vacant houses when they cost €70,000 to do up. With another scheme, the Government will give €800 per property to house Ukrainians but it will not provide that to house local people. How is that fair? 	spk_355

Road safety is paramount. These deer are compromising people's safety. I want to mention the large number of deaths on our roads in north Kerry especially and to sympathise with the families who have lost loved ones. We all feel for those people. Deer have caused many deaths in our county. They have left many cars and vehicles in smithereens and many people are not covered by insurance. We in Kerry cannot carry on with the increased number of deer. They are everywhere, in droves. They are on every road in the county. They are even coming into towns and villages. In the domain in Killarney they are knocking over rubbish bins. They are emanating from the national park and forests, many of which are State owned. The number of deer has resulted in a rise in Lyme disease because they are carriers. Many people do not report accidents. Farmers' crops and grasses have been ravaged by these fellows. Given the cost of fertiliser, life is unbearable for many farmers. Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae raised this matter at a full meeting of Kerry County Council last week. He pointed out that hardly a day goes by that Kerry County Council does not have to take deer off the Kilgarvan road. They are roaming everywhere, on the Bunane Road, Lauragh, Tuosist, Moll's Gap, Sneem, south and east Kerry and the N22 in Killarney. My son made smithereens of his car on the N22 travelling from Killarney at Ballydowney. They are in Kilcummin, Gneevgullia, Scart, Rathmore and Castleisland. Along with the carnage on our roads, they have farmers cleaned out. The late Terence Casey, a former south Kerry coroner, launched a fierce attack on the National Park and Wildlife Service, NPWS, in 2016. This followed an inquest into the death of a Killorglin mother, Susan von der Geest. It was claimed she had swerved to avoid a deer and lost her life. She left three children after her when she hit a tree. Mr. Casey said in 2016 when he visited the area to see the deer for himself that if another fatal accident happened blame would be apportioned to the NPWS. I call for a serious cull of the deer population like they are supposed to be doing in Wicklow. The roads in Kerry need to be made safe for all of the people who use them. Maybe the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, does not want people on our roads. He has suggested that we have wolves as well. We have enough problems with deer. I ask the Taoiseach to organise a serious, proper cull.	spk_84
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-25	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I thank the Taoiseach. I am not happy with his response. He does not seem to be really concerned about it. In Kerry we have lost many lives, through people swerving and hitting trees. That is a fact. Large stags have landed on bonnets. Roads in Kerry are not safe, morning, noon or night. Deer are even going down into Valentia Island, Gneevgullia and Scartaglen. At any hour of the day or night people cannot travel on the roads. I am calling for a serious and immediate cull. The Government is talking about increasing penalty points and reducing speed limits, but we have to deal with this threat on our roads. After all, Sika deer are only vermin and that is the truth of it. We like our red deer and do our best to maintain that herd. Sika deer are encroaching on their space. In light of all that has gone on and all of the lives that have been lost this year alone, including the lives lost in Kerry, I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that a proper cull takes place. If there are 5,500 licences, it is not nearly enough. We need more like 100,000 licences in order to get rid of the deer that are in droves all over the county. It is not fair. Our roads need to be made safe for the people who are travelling on them. They are doing their level best and what is being allowed to happen on our roads is not fair. If a farmer let a calf onto a road, his house would be claimed from him if he did not have insurance to cover the animal. That is the God's gospel truth.	spk_86

When their house is broken into, people can feel very upset and they are even afraid to go back into their house after something like this happens. It is so hard to bring the criminal or perpetrator to justice. They have so many avenues. What is terrible is the system whereby free legal aid continues to be made available to people who commit crimes continuously. There has to be some crackdown on that. People feel very hurt and betrayed over it because these people appear in court, get a suspended sentence and they have the best legal aid and solicitors or what have you and the next thing they are caught again a few months later doing something similar and they get free legal aid again. That has to stop. It is the victims of the crime who are always suffering because of this and the criminal or perpetrator does not seem to suffer at all. The other thing is that people looking for asylum here commit serious crime. Instead of wasting time with them when they came here in the first place seeking asylum, when they commit a serious assault or something we should not be wasting our time or money bringing them before the courts because nothing is going to happen to them anyway.

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-25	dail	33	European Parliament Directive on Victims of Crime: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_21	I have no other way of doing it only telling the truth. Free legal aid is being abused all over the country and it has to be curtailed and reined in. I am asking the Minister of State to do that now. I am talking about the victims of crime and the people who have been robbed. I know of a case where the person whose money was taken went into the Garda station to identify the people and he asked had the person the change or the money he took or had he money left. The answer was that he had but it was being kept until later. That is absolutely ridiculous. More or less, it was being kept to pay for cigarettes for the person who was apprehended. God almighty. I do not know. It seems to me that the victims of crime are not looked after properly. They do not get the attention they deserve even after assaults. It seems to me, and to a lot of people, that it is the perpetrators who are looked after by way of free legal aid and every other chance they can get even if they are continuous offenders.	spk_206

While I welcome the three €150 credits, this system is ridiculous. In the first place, the energy providers are allowed to overcharge and to charge what they like. This is what is happening and we are then trying to get a windfall tax off them. At present, what is happening with this €150 credit is that the Government is paying this with taxpayers' money and we do not even know how that is operating. Are the energy providers being paid for administering it? How long do they have it in their accounts? Somebody who has already paid will not get the €150 but will get the use of extra electricity that they use. Every day since Bord na Móna was closed down, the cost of electricity has gone up in this country, and the Minister of State cannot deny it. We have the highest cost for electricity in Europe at 47.12 cent per kWh, including taxes, while the European average is 26.34 cent per kWh. However, where has the regulator gone? Where is the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan? There is no account of the regulator; he has gone missing and he does not want to know. At the same time the cost of energy is driving up the cost of living. The Government claims this €150 credit is to address the increase in the cost of living. However, why is it not stopped at source? Why not stop and ensure that people only pay a proper and reasonable price?	spk_227
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-24	dail	33	Finance (No. 2) Bill 2023: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_12	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on the budget again. As the days go by since the budget, many people realise they will be no better off than they were before, particularly because of the cost of energy and electricity. The way this is being operated is these energy companies are let charge exorbitant sums and then we are here trying to pass a Bill to get a windfall tax from them. Where is the regulator? These people are mostly private investors since the State closed Bord na Móna. We are at their every whim and they can charge us what they like, given the Minister and the regulator are not putting any curb on them. Infrastructure has been badly neglected over the years, and it is worse in this budget. All the local improvement schemes are getting is enough to do 24 or 25 roads per year from a list that remains at 650. It was pointed out at a recent Kerry County Council meeting that it will take 30 years to exhaust the list and many people will have died before that happens. That is a sad reflection on how we treat the people of rural Ireland. The Killarney bypass has been shelved. There are 23,000 vehicle movements each day and it has been shelved again, after people waited 23 or 24 years for this important road. Class three and minor roads are totally neglected and the local authority is not getting near enough funding for them. On housing, we have called for a meaningful tax reduction to incentivise people in the private sector to let houses to people who need to put a roof over their head. All we see is that someone who has a house and will rent it to refugees will get an €800-per-month tax exemption. Why is that tax exemption not available to our people as well? It is the same with school transport. We have a situation local to me where a 24-seater bus takes 11 refugees to a certain school and 13 local children will not be let on that bus. I do not want to treat refugees or people who come into the country badly but I certainly want to ensure our children in Killarney are treated the same as people coming into the county. That is only fair. Every man and woman is being hurt by the carbon tax, whether they are working or taking children to school or are hauliers or farmers.Today, green diesel costs farmers €1.29. I know how much that would fill the tractors we have today. The Government is wondering why the cost of living is going up. The cost of food will also have to go up. Farmers are no Mother Teresas. They are being vilified at every hand's turn. I can tell the Minister of State and the Government that they need not worry about cows because farmers are starting to get out of the sector themselves. Young people will not take over farms. I spoke to at least six large dairy farmers who were self-sufficient and had put a lot of money into their farms. They told me their sons were not taking them over. There is no way in the world they would do so, if they are to be treated like farmers are currently being treated by the Government. Agriculture is the only real natural resource we have. The Government does not want to look at the gas off the Kerry coast, oil off the Cork coast or liquified natural gas in Shannon to make ourselves self-sufficient in any way. The Government closed down Bord na Móna and everything we had. It will not be satisfied until it puts farmers out of business because that is what is has been doing, what it is doing and what it will continue to do while leaving the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, directing what to do. The whole country is up in arms about flooding. Businesses have been ruined and destroyed. The Government will have to realise that if we do not clean out rivers and gullies people will be flooded. There has been building on flood plains, as was done in Midleton. The river close to the town had not been cleaned for 35 years. I have pointed out that the River Shannon has not been cleaned out since the 1880s. It was done at that time by the British. Another issue is health. The Government said it allocated €22 billion to the HSE. It said that is not enough. Sick people are feeling that because there is a lack of GPs and nurses. Extra people are coming into our towns and villages and there is more pressure on accident and emergency departments. This is being reflected in fair deal, whereby people aged 85 and 86 cannot access the scheme and are being told they are well enough to return home. One woman arrived at Kerry General Hospital by ambulance 21 times in the past three months and was sent home in a taxi. That is not good enough. The Government must talk to the HSE. It has given it so much power it is now telling the Government what it will and will do. That is not fair. It is the ordinary sick person who is feeling the pinch.	spk_137
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-24	dail	33	Health Service Funding: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_13	I am glad to have the chance to address the Ministers of State this evening and highlight a few things I am concerned about. I will start with the recruitment freeze on home helps. Things were bad enough with the home help situation in County Kerry before this. I am asking for that to be dealt with positively. A new problem is arising with fair deal in that the HSE is refusing to sanction people for it, even though they are living alone, are in their mid-80s, have serious health problems and cannot manage in their homes alone. The HSE has refused in at least six instances to sign off and say people were entitled to go forward for fair deal. That is terrible. Elderly people in their 80s are being refused fair deal. I cannot understand it. Are they short of money or what, coming up to the end of the year? I am asking again for a minor injuries unit for Killarney, either on the site of the old district hospital or the St. Columbanus Home, both of which are shortly merging into the new community hospital in Killarney, and we are thankful for it. We also have to deal with the lack of GPs. Refugees are arriving into our country at the rate of 200 each day. It is as manifest in Kerry and Killarney as much as everywhere else. There will have to be more GPs to deal with those people. It is only fair we provide them and they will have to be got somewhere. There is more pressure now on our accident and emergency departments because the doctors cannot manage. Even SouthDoc after hours is under tremendous pressure. Where do people finish up only in the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee? Another issue is section 39 workers. Some kind of deal has been arrived at but is not finalised yet. I am calling for complete parity of pay and conditions. There is no other way about it. They are entitled because they are doing the same work as HSE workers. They are trained and skilled staff. I also want to raise the issue of St. Mary of the Angels. It is not taking in any new residents. It is closing down by stealth because anyone who dies, which has happened today, sadly, is not being replaced. This site is a wonderful place and campus. There are so many facilities there. I am asking for single units to be built on the campus of St. Mary of the Angels for people who need this residential care.That is the way to get around the decongregation model the Government wants to arrive at. 	spk_179
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-18	dail	33	Driving Test Waiting Times: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this very important topic and motion because for all of this year, my office has been inundated with calls from young people, boys and girls, looking to do and to be called for their driving test and to get on the road for many reasons, such as going to college, secondary schools and to work. They have been and are promised driving jobs but they cannot get their test. I had an instance a number of weeks ago where a father wanted his son to drive a van in his business. He applied for the test last January and he was told it would be this coming January before he would be invited to apply for a test. One could be talking about anything from 12 to 15 months. That is not acceptable, I say to the Minister of State. I raised this issue below at the Committee on Transport and Communications a number of weeks ago and we were told that so many new testers would be employed and that the matter would be rectified by next June. God Almighty, it is not right that we have to tell young people that they have to wait a year and a half. I was also told at that committee meeting that most of the new testers would be designated for Dublin. That is not fair. They said that more than half of the new testers who would be put working would be designated to Dublin. We have a public transport system in Dublin, and I do not begrudge Dublin, but people in rural Kerry need to get on the road. I called at that meeting for an amnesty. It happened before and the amnesty need only operate until the person gets their licence, for those that are waiting or have to wait 12 months. For people who are applying today, it could be next June or July before they will be invited for a test and maybe later. That is not acceptable. I feel that there is an ulterior motive here by the Minister of State's senior Minister, Deputy Ryan, where he does not want to improve roads and I feel that he does not want young people to get on the road. There is a time when young people, who are full of go, want to get going, get out in the world and go to work, and they do not want to be dependent on their parents to take them here or there but want to get going themselves. Perhaps the senior Minister wants to stop them at that stage and-----	spk_33
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-18	dail	33	Driving Test Waiting Times: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	-----decide that if they have a car but they cannot drive it, that they will have to get a taxi or a bus. In rural Ireland, that is not an option because if one had the money that is in the Central Bank, one could not put public transport into the nooks and corners of Kerry like the Black Valley, Gneeveguilla, The Pocket in Glenmore, Lauragh and all of those places. The money in the Central Bank would not provide such a transport service for them. We also have a shortage of bus drivers. It takes so long to get a test and the cost is over €3,000. We asked the Government several times before to extend the limit for school bus drivers who had stopped driving at 70 years of age and we asked if they could do a medical test designated by Bus Éireann. If these people were deemed medically fit to drive, they should be allowed to drive each year at least up until they were 75 years of age because we are losing great drivers. Many bus services are not able to operate, including school bus services. Again, I say to the Minister of State that it is time for the Government to wake up and do something. Urgent action needs to be taken. Telling us that it will have things sorted out next June is a failure. There will probably be an election by then and the Government will not be accountable then because many Members of this Government, especially the Green Party Members, will be blown out of existence because that is what they deserve for the hurt they have imposed on the people of rural Ireland. The other Government Members are supporting that party just to stay in power and are aiding and abetting them to stay in power at the expense of rural people.That is not fair and I ask the Minister of State to do something. Give them an amnesty now to let them on the road.	spk_35

There is still a massive number of people dying in County Kerry. The worst thing that ever happened in our country was reflected in the number of elderly people and others who died alone in hospitals and nursing homes. Despite all they did in their lives for community and family, they died on their own. That must never be allowed to happen again. There is a lot of conversation. The minute I mention the word “vaccination”, I am accused of being anti-vax, but the conversation is being had and people are asking why all the deaths are happening. They are asking whether they are the result of Covid or the vaccinations and they need answers. We need to have an independent investigation into what is happening because life is precious and we want people to live as long as possible. We still want the babies being aborted to live. The increase in deaths all over needs to be investigated. People are dying from clots, heart attacks and strokes. Doctors and nurses will talk about this privately but they will not state in public what they believe to be the cause. It is as if they are silenced. They know the cause because they were dealing with the patients who died, including people in their 40s – young people who should be around for many years to come. There is concern over what is happening in our community. The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, should please adhere to the request for an independent investigation into what has happened. The Chinese have got away scot-free without being held to account regarding how the virus started and how we paid such a high price for it.	spk_184

We are all calling for peace. No matter how long a war goes on, it has to finish. It would be much better, however, if it finished sooner rather than later. What happened last night, with a hospital being blown to smithereens and more than 500 patients killed in it, is horrible and disastrous. This country suffered for 700 or 800 years and had an awful fight to get our own self-determination. The one thing I have seen around the hills and glens where I have done contracting work, and it reminds me every day, are the ridges of Garrane that were sat by people at that time. They never dug them because they starved with the hunger when the blight took their crop, while at the same time we had plenty of produce, including beef and grain, going across the water as people here starved. They died one way or another. What is happening is terrible when children and babies have no water or food, or shelter from incoming bombs and missiles. They are in a terrible way and cannot get out. They are cornered like a rat or anything inside a hole. They cannot get out. Corridors must be opened up to let medicines and doctors in and to ensure these people are treated humanely. It is desperate what is going on. We can do little in the Chamber only ask the greater powers to raise the bar, get stuck into this thing, and ensure it is called off as soon as possible. As I said, all wars have to end. It is terrible what is happening to the innocent. This is not a fair war at all. We know that Hamas looked for it and caused it. Hamas must be rooted out, although I do not know how it can be because it is entrenched. We are all calling for peace.	spk_253

We here are the guardians of the public. The Minister of State and his Government are driving people into the hands of these energy providers that are making four times the profit they need to make. I do not begrudge them profit. I have operated in business too and you do need to make a fair profit, but it is not the way to run a house to push people and to take so much off them that the Government finds itself giving back energy credits. The Government should have control. There is an energy regulator but there is no account from it. It is doing what it likes or it is doing nothing at all. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is supposed to be its boss, does not care. He closed down Bord na Móna, where we had State-owned fuel, in the blink of an eye. The Government is now driving people into these fellows' hands, enticing them with grants to put in heat pumps or what-have-you and it is only codding them. The Government is not being fair. We are the guardians of the public and what the Government is doing is criminal. There is no account of the regulator, and no account of the Minister who is in charge of the regulator, which is doing nothing at all. We are here discussing how we will manage a windfall tax. God almighty, a Cheann Comhairle, it is a sad state of affairs that this is what our country has come to, and that this is what the Government is doing to the people of Ireland, our own people. The Government is a shame, a crying shame for doing this. There is no law or order to what it is doing at all. I ask the Minister of State at this late stage to cop on and put some rein on these energy regulators. The Government is going to grant-aid more of them but it is going to paralyse the people by getting them to pay whatever number these energy providers think of. This is criminal. I ask the Minister of State to rethink what he is doing. Does he think that he is codding the people by giving them energy credits of €150 now and €150 later on? A pile of small businesses are closing. I gave an example of a lady in mid-Kerry who had a small café. She closed it down the week before last because she was paying €100 a day for electricity. Her bill for 48 days was €4,800. She is closed now, along with many others. It is very wrong what we are doing here. We cannot stop the Government because Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party have joined up to do this to the people of Ireland. This is one of the worst acts the Government has carried out. This Chamber should be full here tonight to discuss what is going on because it has such a massive effect in terms of the repercussions for every man, woman and child. There is talk about using more electricity. To give one example, there is such a thing as hydrotreated vegetable oil, HVO. All we need to do is take the tax off that and we would reduce emissions for everyone who uses it by 87%. They could use the same vehicles. They could make very minor adjustments to their fuel pumps for driving the radiators in their houses. They could pour the vegetable oil into the same oil tank and that is all the modification that is needed. HVO can be poured straight into a diesel car and it can drive on without any change in the world. What the Government is doing is taxing those people and making HVO more expensive to buy than it is to buy the fossil fuels coming from Iran or whatever other parts of the world. The Government is ignoring that fact. The Government has no scruples at all. It is talking about paying more carbon tax. All it is doing is charging the people and driving them into the ground. Here we are tonight discussing how to manage the windfall tax. God almighty, it is a shame and a disgrace what the Government is at. This Chamber should be full because it is the most serious issue that is going on in my time in Dáil Éireann. Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle. I am very vexed about this.	spk_271

Again, I refer to the obscene profits the companies have made and will continue to make. There is no reigning in or genuine monitoring by the regulator, who does not seem to be in action at all at any point in time. It is totally unfair. The Government is driving all consumers in the direction of electricity and they have only one route to go if they want to keep warm or keep the light on. The Government is telling them they must get electric cars as well and that everything must be electric. The Government is driving them towards a select few developers. Wherever they are getting their funding from, they are being well seen to by the Government.It should not be the case that people are allowed to take so much profit and then the Government comes back and gives people credits. People should not have to pay in the first place. I know as well as all other people in business that Friday evening comes quickly. I do not know whether any members of the Government have employed people at any point in their lives. It does not seem that the Government is on the side of business or that it understands that businesses have to pay for everything and abide by all the rules and regulations. At the same time, people have been and are being overcharged for electricity. We are debating how to derive more taxes. The Government calls it windfall tax. It is the people who pay for it. The constituents we are representing, the people we are asking to vote for us, have to pay the piper. It is wrong we are even discussing windfall tax. It should not be happening when we have a regulator, a Minister who is supposed to be in charge of the regulator and a Government the Minister is part of. The whole thing is spiralling out of control. The energy providers will rule the roost the way we are going because there is no reining them in. No demands are placed on them by the regulator.	spk_302

As the Minister of State is well aware, we have a lack of residential care places for people with disabilities in County Kerry. There was some mention in the budget that 90 new centres would be opened. We have had a centre for many years in Whitefield, Beaufort in Kerry, known as St. Mary of the Angels, which was donated by the Doyle family. An awful lot of fundraising has gone on through the years to help this place develop and keep going. Sadly now, however, it has been closed by stealth. As a patient dies, that bed is closed down and not used anymore. The Minister of State is well aware of the case I brought to her regarding a person who was looking for residential care when her husband died. She could not mind the strong daughter she has of 32 or 33 years of age. The only offer of a residential care place she got at that time was in County Meath, up against the Six Counties of Ireland in the North. In fairness, I appreciate the Minister of State's intervention. I do not know if she is there all the time but she is only there on a temporary basis as such. I am asking now that St. Mary of the Angels be redeveloped. There are a lot of dormitory-style beds and stuff like that. I am, therefore, asking for new separate units to be built on the grounds. There are acres of land there. The peace and tranquility of that place and the expertise of the care workers who are working there could not be touched anywhere else. It has been handed down to them over generations. I am appealing to the Minister of State. Whatever about this decongregation model, there is a need for a place like this where there are pools and therapies of all types to be had. It is being closed by stealth. I am asking the Minister of State not to do that on these grounds. Saint John of God Kerry Services workers have been doing great work and are doing great work as we talk today, but the place is being closed down by stealth. If we are talking about new residential care places, I ask that Whitefield in Beaufort be developed and made into a state-of-the-art place.

They were very worried.The phone was hopping in recent weeks. It culminated in a deputation coming to my clinic in Scotts Hotel on Saturday, led by Donie Doody and several others. I am glad that the matter seems to be resolved. I have raised it several times over the years in this Chamber. What we hear is that 3% will be paid from last April, 2% in November and 3% next April. My understanding is that there is still 1.5% outstanding before pay parity is arrived at with HSE workers and other public sector workers. I ask that the payments be made and that there be complete parity for the workers. When HSE or other public sector workers get a raise in the future, I ask that these people will get one as well. They took a pay cut back in 2008, which is 15 years ago. It is an awful long time to leave them without proper pay and pay parity. The strike would have left thousands of people without assistance or access to day care centres, leaving many potentially trapped at home, with some unable to even get out of bed without help. We have so many of these service providers in Kerry such as Cheshire Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Enable Ireland, family resource centres, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Kerry Parents and Friends Association. All the individuals and workers involved are highly trained. They can deal with the problems and the expansive range of disabilities of the users. No one else could do their work. It was very hurtful and many people were very angry that the talks went to the brink so late last night. We thank the Department and the people on the workers' side for their work in recent days and for working into the night and ensuring the strike was called off. We are all very grateful for that. I appeal to the Minister of State that whatever difference remains - I am told there is a difference of 1.5% - it will be addressed, that the workers in section 39 organisations will get complete pay parity and that they will have this in the future. The stress imposed on families across the country cannot be reversed. This treatment by the Government was not desirable. I am very hurt about that, as are many other people.	spk_319

People are born with disabilities and others become disabled during their lives. As elected representatives in this Chamber, we must do our level best for them and help the workers because the work is highly specialised.

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-11	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 4: General (Resumed)	dbsect_18	I am glad to get a chance to add to my contribution from last night. There is a lot of concern regarding road safety with ideas about reducing speed limits and increasing penalty points. However, we have to admit that there has been a massive increase in the volume of traffic on every road. I am calling for our roads to be upgraded. Many of our roads were built in the late 1800s and have not been improved much since. Plans for the Killarney bypass, otherwise known as the Kerry-Cork economic corridor, has been shelved this year by the Minister, Deputy Ryan. This is unfortunate because on some days they are 23,000 vehicles movements on this road. I call on the Government to revisit this. After 24 years, surely we are entitled to get that relief road built. There are so many dangerous junctions and bridges on the road, including bridges at Listry, Blackwater and Caragh. None of these bridges has been touched since the 1800s. We know the vast volumes of traffic. We have 660 roads on our local improvement scheme list. That is terrible. Even the Bonane road and the Laragh road are in a shambles, with trees hanging over the road which takes big vehicles. On the Ring of Kerry, so much needs to be done on the road from Sneem to Moll's Gap to trim back the trees and the bushes in terms of the massive volume of buses which are on those roads every day. Section 39 workers deserve pay parity. They are doing the same work as other workers and they have been left behind. They are going on strike and the Government will have to bear the brunt of that because they have been left down. Childcare and creches are being left until next year after all the presentations they made. I want to mention hydrotreated vegetable oil, HVO. This is an option instead of electric. Everyone could use the cars they already have instead of going to the expense of having to purchase an electric car. The Government is not giving this a fair chance. There is a facility in Ringaskiddy for storing this. When I raised this issue last night I got support for it. I am asking for the tax on it to be reduced in order to make it an option if the Government is serious about reducing emissions. Whatever the Government does with emissions, it will still not change the weather, especially when we see what they were doing in other countries like America and China. Here the people are being penalised with carbon taxes that make it harder for people working and transport operators to survive. I ask the Government to look at this option and give it favourable consideration and give it a chance.	spk_176
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-10	dail	33	Budget Statement 2024	dbsect_4	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about the budget. Of course, I welcome the increases in social welfare but I wonder how far they will go or how much they will alleviate the situation for people who are having problems and who can barely exist and keep going. Health is so important and is the first thing I want to talk about. We have a lack of GPs in Kerry and I am sure it is same all over the country. There is also a shortage of nurses in our hospitals and chaos in accident and emergency departments, particularly in University Hospital Kerry, where people are waiting for hours on trolleys and chairs. Waiting times for replacement hips, knees and cataract operations are excessive. Myself and Deputy Michael Collins started running buses to Dublin for people who were suffering agony in the garden with pain in their hips and their backs and whatever and many would have gone blind. I am asking the Minister of State, but there is no Government representative here now, wherever he has gone-----	spk_100
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-10	dail	33	Budget Statement 2024	dbsect_4	I am asking the Government to provide a minor injuries unit in Killarney and a separate one in Tralee to help to reduce the waiting times in the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Kerry. Our disability services are severely lacking and the people who operate those services, many of them section 39 workers, are not adequately paid. Residential care is practically non-existent. I dealt with a patient a few months ago who was told that the only place that could be found for her was in County Meath, up beside the Six Counties in the North. There has been much debate about the childcare assistance but people will not see any improvement until next September, almost 12 months away. Middle income earners are struggling with the cost of rent, food and electricity. Energy providers have been let run amok and can charge what they like. People are also struggling with the cost of running a car and fuel costs. Many do not qualify for social welfare. The squeezed middle cannot get on the social housing lists and they cannot get planning permission in many parts of Kerry. The planning regulator is ensuring that. On childcare costs, they are getting no help, as I said, until next September. On mortgages, interest rates are an issue. The banks are doing what they like. The Government says that it cannot increase anything because it will drive up inflation but the banks can do so. The cost of gas is increasing. We had one chance in Kerry of ensuring that we would have continuity of supply, and maybe at a lesser price, with Shannon LNG but the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications stopped it. It will not get the go-ahead, even though it would have cost the Government nothing.  For the people that suffer with depression, the Government has increased the price of cigarettes by 75 cent. It is totally unfair to be blaming them for something. Many young people do not smoke because they are aware of the consequences but there are elderly people out there who cannot just give up and the Government is trying to drive them into the ground.  The Government is putting up the price of a bag of coal by €1 and there is an additional 20 cent on a tank of diesel for the house. The Government has promised free school transport for all but only some children are getting it. Children from this country have to abide by the 2-mile rule to get free school transport but children from another country, even if they are only half a mile or 800 metres away from the school, get free transport, including taxis. That is not fair and that has to be addressed. Small and medium-sized employers have been hit with increased energy costs and they cannot source workers. They have difficulties with the minimum wage, which the Government is increasing. I do not begrudge workers and agree they should be paid properly. The honest truth is that if employers do not pay people properly, they will not get workers but the increase in the minimum wage should be planned better. It should be done gradually, with staged increases every year so that employers know where they are going. There are many medium and small businesses closing. I met the owner of a small restaurant the other day who told me she is closing down because her ESB bill for 48 days was €4,800. That was €100 per day for a small café supplying sandwiches and light food. The housing cap needs to be increased. As I said, many people cannot get on the housing list. Many house owners will not rent out their property because of the tax they have to pay and because they are afraid they will not get their homes back. I ask the Minister to do something about that. Many local young people cannot get planning permission in Kerry, particularly if sites are beside national roads or in areas deemed to be under severe, urban-generated pressure. These are the main reasons people are not able to get planning permission. I am speaking here about sites that are 10 miles outside Killarney and the same is true in Kenmare and Dingle. People who want to build a house for themselves just cannot do so.  On agriculture, we got 17 lines in 64 pages from the two Ministers today. Farmers are being vilified and terrorised every day. We have the likes of President Higgins sticking his nose into what hard-working people are eating, telling them to eat plant-based foods. I say to him that people working hard need meat. The Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, was in New York and said he was worried about global food security but at the same time, he is culling cows here in Ireland. The Taoiseach was boasting about eating vegan food and said that it was better for him. Why is the Government treating the farmers like this?	spk_103

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-10	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 1: Mineral Oil Tax	dbsect_7	I am glad to get this opportunity. I thank Sinn Féin for going against the carbon tax tonight. We will not talk about what happened in the past, but we are glad and we hope it will continue in this vein against the carbon tax because it is totally and absolutely unfair. We have been against it from day one. This will hurt many people at midnight tonight. It will hurt the people who are going to work. It will hurt the people who are taking children to school. It will hurt all those in the transport business. It will hurt those in the agricultural contracting business. It will hurt farmers. It will make life more miserable for all these people. We have seen the cost of fuel go up already and, yes, much of it is caused by foreign markets or whatever. It is reprehensible to think the Government is putting on a carbon tax tonight at 12 o'clock. When we came up the road today, it cost €1.83 a litre or whatever it is. It will be €1.85 and maybe more as we are going down on Thursday. I say to the Minister that this carbon tax has nothing at all to do with reducing emissions because there are other options and he is saying that there are not. There is such a thing as hydrotreated vegetable oil, HVO. Producing this oil could help farmers and give them another enterprise to plant rapeseed and get paid for it. This option would mean a reduction in emissions of almost 90%. The good thing about it is people do not have to buy an expensive electric car. They can just pour it into the same diesel tank in their cars that they poured the diesel into this morning. It would not cost people anything extra. The Minister has talked about the carbon tax being used for heat pumps. Fitting these heat pumps to many houses will cost €50,000. People have to pay for it upfront and they then may get a grant of €25,000. Where will hard-pressed people get that €25,000? He is giving no thought at all to that. This HVO could be poured directly into the kerosene tank with a minor adjustment to the boiler for heating people's houses. That has to be thought of. The Minister has a one-track mind and is hanging his shirt on electricity. At the same time, the Government stopped us getting from getting another gas from the west through Shannon LNG. It is also giving no consideration to LPG which was available 50 years ago and there are no emissions at all from that. Fellows fitted them to petrol cars at that time and they can be fitted to diesel cars now with no extra cost and no savage cost. I saw an electric car out in the yard the other day and when I asked the cost of it, I was told €65,000. Who has that to pay? There is no option to buy second-hand electric cars. People do not have that kind of money to spend in rural Ireland. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, may want people to cycle and forget about cars altogether. What I am saying to him is that if he is in Scartaglen, is it not a nice thing to be asked to cycle into Killarney and up to Cork to go to work or in Gneeveguilla or some other place like that. That is not fair. By charging people the carbon tax, the Minister is just codding them. Anyone supporting him is trying to cod the people. This carbon tax is very unfair when fuel is so expensive. I have a lot more to say about this, but the Government is denying the people. There is another thing and even the media up there do not print it. The batteries for electric cars are being produced by child labour in the Congo. You are denying that and at the same time you are talking about helping children. To hell with you; you are there too long. Tomorrow is too long to have you there again.	spk_140
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-10	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 3: Tobacco Products Tax	dbsect_13	Many years ago I worked with two men. One of them did not smoke and one of them did. The fellow who did not used to always be jarring the other fellow. He said that if God intended him to be a smoking man he would have put a chimney in him. I do not smoke, and I know it is bad for people, but I do not agree with this tax. As has been said about people who are addicted, God how they appreciate their cigarette. They rush outside the door and that is what they look forward to. We are penalising those people. The Minister said we have it down to 14% but that may not allow for illegal cigarettes because there is a lot of them coming into the country. It is unfair to penalise people with this tax. They may leave the table short, or their child short for something. The money the Government is already getting from tax should be more visible in education and in our schools, and more time given to advising young people not to smoke. I understand the people who are smoking. Many of them started before government warnings about smoking and the way it can damage your health. Tonight I feel for people who have started and who are addicted. It will make it tough on their pocket. Many of these people are social welfare recipients. The extra €12 the Government gave today is welcome. However, much of that will be eroded with the extra 75 cent being charged for cigarettes. Again, I say that the Minister is encouraging the illicit sale of cigarettes. He may be dragging young people to do some other thing. Youngsters being youngsters will try something, and maybe even drugs that will be much worse and do more harm to our society and young population. I worry for parents today and into the future rearing children with all of the problems they face. I appeal to the Minister to look at this again. It is now almost €1 per cigarette. People who are smoking, particularly the older people, will continue to smoke and something else will suffer because they will not have money in their pocket. I will be opposing this.	spk_264

This change in roster is antagonising all those in the force. From what I have heard on the grapevine, what it will mean for Kerry and places like it, is that in a vast area from Killarney, through Killorglin, into Cahersiveen, Valentia Island back up to Waterville, Sneem and Kilgarvan and all around that entire ring, only one Garda car will be available from 2 a.m. until 6 a.m. That is not acceptable. We were already told this morning on the radio that there is a 4% reduction in the force in Kerry. The other thing is that boys and girls from Kerry contemplating joining the force invariably know they will be sent to Dublin. They cannot afford to live up here. Even if there was a man and a woman who were husband and wife, they would not be able to afford to live in Dublin. Will the Minister do something about that to ensure the job makes it worth their while to join? There are so many members of the force from Kerry up here who want to get down the country and out of Dublin.	spk_45

I support it, as everyone who is elected here should. Deputies have spoken about people who died in terrible conditions in containers, including one case a couple of years ago. Other speakers mentioned the heat and lack of water, but people died because there was no air. That kind of death was totally inhuman. We must ensure that anyone involved in that kind of carry-on comes before the courts in this country and is dealt with seriously. It is the worst type of crime to do that to human beings. Human trafficking is a grave violation of human rights and a global problem that affects people from various regions who are trying to reach a better world. People, including those seeking better opportunities, cannot be blamed for that. Traffickers prey on the dreams and vulnerabilities of migrants, promising them a brighter future but subjecting them to unimaginable exploitation. One alarming aspect of human trafficking in Ireland is the practice of confiscating identification documentation from victims before they even land in the country. That tactic is part of a broader strategy to keep victims trapped and under the control of traffickers. Traffickers often confiscate identification documents for several reasons. We have been told that new data for 2019-20 revealed that child victims represented 23% of all registered victims in the EU. However, in Ireland only nine children were identified as victims during the same period, accounting for less than half of the total number of victims. This discrepancy between the EU and Irish averages is striking and suggests potential issues with identifying child trafficking victims in Ireland. The Bill is important to prevent the exploitation of women for sexual reasons, prostitution or whatever. We must endeavour to ensure that women, men and children are treated humanely and the traffickers who are involved in desperate moneymaking operations are deterred from that by dealing with them properly in our country. We need to ensure that the might of the law is brought upon them and that they pay for severely for their practices.	spk_208

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-10-03	dail	33	School Transport 2023-2024: Statements	dbsect_14	First, I have to say that my family operates a school bus service and has for many years. All parents really depend on school bus transport to take their children to school. Practically all parents need their children to be taken to school safely. Back in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Governments promised that when the outlying school would be closed down, the schoolchildren would be bussed to the central school. Even last year, the Minister promised that all children would get free travel to school. She has gone back on that. If a child needs to go to school, there has to be ten children to start up a new run. That is not fair either. I want to thank our inspectors, especially Michael Tyther, Tim Collins and Brenda Kirby in our local office school bus section, who have done tremendous work with limited resources. This over-70 rule is absolutely ridiculous. I have been raising it for three or four years now. All I am asking is that these excellent drivers be allowed drive once they present for a medical that is ordained by Bus Éireann. Bus Éireann is the only organisation that is preventing them from driving. They can drive the Local Link bus, they can take children on school bus tours organised by the school, the very same children they cannot bring to school. I also have to say this. We need to treat our own Irish schoolgoing children the same as all the other children who have come into the country. While we welcome all those other children, there is an anomaly there. If you are inside the 2-mile limit you will not get what is known as a concessionary ticket but that does not apply to new children who come in. We have two sets of rules around Killarney and around many of our towns and villages whereby the new children who come in are bussed and it is organised for them but our own local children, whose parents went to the same school, cannot get that facility.	spk_150

We all saw those people who came up so organised last week and highlighted their plight. It was one of the largest crowds that has been outside the gates for much of the time I have been here. The story now is this has gone as far as parents having to ensure they have a childcare place before they actually have the child. It has gone this far because they see their neighbours and other parents suffering while trying to find childcare places. They cannot find them and places are closing down. Some 97 places have already closed around our country and more are contemplating closing. The providers cannot pay their way. Likewise, many of the childcare workers are earning as little as €17,000 annually, which is not acceptable. Long gone is the day when grandparents and mothers minded the children at home. Grandparents played an integral part in keeping the children out of the fire and the barrel of water, and the children did jobs for them. That day is long gone. Families need two parents to continue to work to keep the roof over their heads. However, it is happening now that many of them cannot do so, with one having to stay at home. The Minister has to do something about this, as he promised he would. He has let people down; there would not have been so many of them outside the gate of Leinster House if he had not done so. He is compromising the situation of these families because he is too busy looking after refugees and asylum seekers. That is not fair on our children.	spk_181

It has house owners frightened away from renting their housing. At the clinics I hold in my neck of the woods - I hold them all over the county - people tell me they have houses to rent for €600, €700 or €800 a month but they are afraid that if they let people in for the year or two in which they want to rent the property, they will not be able to get the people out again. I am asking the RTB and Threshold to adopt a different role. They should go out sourcing houses, talk to the people who own them and encourage them to rent the houses. The Government should reduce the tax on those renting out properties. If people have to pay 51% or 52% on the €600 or €700 they receive for renting out a house, they will not bother renting it out in the first place, given the cost of keeping the house going and replacing washing machines and gas cookers and all that.I could say a lot more, but the Government is doing more harm than good.	spk_45

As has been said, if there is any breakdown or any shortage of supply coming from the direction we are getting it at present, it is surely only common sense to say the French, the English and all mainland Europe will ensure they have gas before they will let it go west as far as Ireland. We had a golden opportunity to have a Shannon LNG terminal on the Ballylongford land bank. The company that was behind it has invested at least €100 million in this worthwhile project. It lodged another application two and a half years ago and, lo and behold, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, put in a submission against it. I contended last week - during Leaders' Questions I raised the same issue regarding the Shannon LNG project as well as other matters concerning County Kerry - that that was a very unusual departure. I said it was not acceptable for a Minister to lodge an objection to an application like this. Indeed, when one of my family members applied for planning permission a few years ago, the director of services advised me not to make a written submission for it.I had to be seen not to be involved, yet here we had a Minister making a submission against this application, thereby undermining the State's energy security. He has already done a great deal of harm by closing down Bord na Móna at Shannonbridge and Lanesborough. I am told many elderly people will not have briquettes this year. Briquettes were coming from Lithuania or somewhere else in recent years, but that has now been deemed illegal and there will be no briquettes to be had this winter. People are still cutting turf in Kerry. I am glad to say I am one of them. Since 1803, turf has been cut on our bog in Kilgarvan by a Healy from Rae. That has continued through the generations, including this year when Maura Healy-Rae stood and footed the turf, brought it home herself with a dumper and put it into the shed. That is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The same will happen next year, if we live for it – we hope we do – and the year after that. Stopping the Shannon LNG project was nonsense. We had the chance to obtain gas from South America and many other sources in the West, but that is being denied now and the State’s energy security is being compromised by the Government. We have to blame Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Like Deputy Michael Healy-Rae stated, the Tánaiste canvassed the length and breadth of north Kerry with the now Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, when both of them promised the people of north Kerry that, if they sent Norma Foley to the Dáil and if Fianna Fáil got into power, Fianna Fáil would deliver on the Shannon LNG project. A few days later when it joined with the Green Party, it signed a memorandum saying it would not support the project. That is deceit of the highest order and it must be recognised and called out as such. The Green Party is not the only party responsible, or Fine Gael to a lesser extent. Fianna Fáil has major responsibility.	spk_162

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-09-21	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_32	I need to bring to the Minister's attention the high level of anger, dissatisfaction and frustration felt by many people in Kerry because of two things, namely, the Shannon LNG project and the Killarney bypass. Energy security is being compromised, jobs are being lost and, in the case of the Killarney bypass, road safety is being compromised. Shannon LNG's application to An Bord Pleanála for approval for a gas terminal on the Ballylongford land bank in north Kerry was turned down in recent days. The refusal was primarily due to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan's, submission against the application, which he made many months ago. Indeed, the language used by An Bord Pleanála in the refusal included the same words as the Minister, Deputy Ryan's, submission. This is political interference at the highest level. Deputy Ryan used his influence as a Minister to block a planning application as he highlighted that the Shannon LNG application was against Government policy. I call for a high-level investigation by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, or whoever, into the Minister's actions. As majority partners in government, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are complicit in what has happened to this application for allowing the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to abuse his position in the way he has, especially the Tánaiste and former Taoiseach, the Fianna Fáil Party leader, Deputy Micheál Martin. When he was canvassing for the election of Deputy Foley in the last general election, he promised the people of north Kerry that he would back Shannon LNG and it would become a reality. He has let us down. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has also blocked the progression of the next part of the upgrading of the N22 Cork-Kerry economic corridor, also known as the Killarney bypass, which has been on the table and promised for more than 20 years. It is vital for the economy of our county and for the safety of the 23,000 people who use the road on a daily basis. He has stopped Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, doing the necessary environmental and economic capacity assessments. As I already stated, more than 23,000 vehicles use this road already. TII was to notify the landowners and the public of the preferred route. Four routes are being considered. TII now cannot do so because it does not have the funding. Much land has been sterilised for many years and many landowners are contemplating legal action to get their land back to use as they want, which is their legal right. Is what many people are saying to me now right, which is that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has neglected County Kerry for driving tests? Is it because he does not want young people on the roads? They have been waiting since last January and will wait until next January to be allowed to apply for a driving test. That is not fair on the young lads in our county.	spk_260

While I welcome that Sinn Féin is bringing the motion forward, I do not exactly agree 100% that this will be targeted enough to help the people who are in trouble. What I cannot understand is that the Government is agreeing to these interest rate increases, and the Government is saying the reason for it is to curb inflation. At the same time we know that the people affected by this are on the road going to work every day and the cost at the petrol pumps has gone to more than €1.85 per litre of petrol or diesel - they are nearly all the same now. Why is some control not being put on that? No. The Government is insistent on putting it back on excise duty and increasing the carbon tax. These same people the Government is affecting are also trying to pay the extra higher interest on their mortgages. I cannot understand that, nor when the Government allows the ECB to say it is fine because it is to curb inflation. This does not make sense to me when at the other end the very same people who are on the road in the dark in the mornings and going home in the dark in the evening are paying through the nose for the petrol and the diesel they are using. The Government is not making any sense or any logic to those poor people out there who are trying to deal with the increases. I am asking the Government, and it had shareholdings in AIB and Bank of Ireland, why it does not intervene and intercede to ensure people get fair play. The Government has lost the run of themselves. I cannot understand and a lot more like me cannot understand that by increasing interest rates, the Government is going to curb inflation, while at the same time the Government us driving us mad with carbon tax and excise duty on top of the exorbitant cost of the base price of oil to start out with.	spk_223

It is very important because we all know that sport is so important in developing youth and bringing communities together. For many years, Gaelic football and hurling were the dominant games in Kerry but soccer is now coming forth. We are glad to see Kerry FC, which is now in the League of Ireland, doing very well this year. It needs financial support to ensure it develops further. We are glad the Kerry ladies will have an under-17 team starting out in next year's League of Ireland competition. This is very good for youngsters. The ladies aspect is progressing very much and we must ensure we help them financially. Every euro spent on sport is money well spent because once you keep youth occupied and active, it helps them in many ways. It helps their health, including their mental health, and they gain friends they would not meet if they were not involved. A big problem for soccer and football clubs starting out concerns the ownership of fields and property. They cannot get any grants if they do not have a field or property of their own. This needs to be examined to ensure they can get funding to start out or help them to buy places. It would be remiss of me not to mention that the Kerry team is playing Derry next Sunday. I wish the players well. They are doing very well and we wish them further success. The big problem is the paywall that has been put up by the GAA and RTÉ, preventing people who cannot travel to it from seeing the match.	spk_44

I am totally and absolutely against what is proposed. I do not think it is necessary in the first place. We do not have these kinds of demonstrations, that I know of, on my side of the country, in our county. In a lot of places we have practising GPs whom people go to daily. People cannot get to their GPs. How will these zones be marked for people who do not know where those GPs are? Someone could be within such an exclusion zone unwittingly. Are we going to mark these places or what? This is shocking and not needed. I am frightened when I read these figures. Back in 2018, there were 4,577 abortions. In 2020, there were 6,577. In 2019, there were 6,666. Last year, in 2022, we had 8,156 - 8,156 little babies. They all had a heartbeat, and that is what is sad about the whole thing. These little babies have a right to life, and all they wanted to do is to be let live. I am sorry there is not more emphasis on education given to young girls first of all on the availability of contraceptives and on being careful. Education at secondary schools is very important. We should place our emphasis on that. Consider what the 8,156 little babies could contribute to our country in the years ahead. That is what is sad about all this, that we are not making a better effort to ensure these little babies get the chance to live. I am lucky enough to have six grandchildren. I had one recently, a little girl. Isla Healy-Rae is her name. I am very proud of her and look forward to seeing her grow up like the other grandchildren I have. They are very important. The Minister wants to write his name into history. There is no need for this. Look at what he is not doing for home help. Look at what he is not doing by way of providing GPs. Look at the waiting lists in our hospitals and our nursing homes. Then there is the CAMHS debacle that so many vulnerable people suffered in south Kerry. The Minister says it did not manifest in any other area. That is a lie. The Minister came in here with some story two or three weeks ago. There are people affected in other areas. He need not put down his head at all because I am telling him the truth. What he told was blatant lies.	spk_199

Planning is hurting a great number of people in our county who cannot get planning to build houses for themselves. It is the Government Planning Regulator who is the cause of this. These people just want planning permission. They will build the house themselves and they will foot the bill, as dear as it is, but they are not getting the planning permission. Voids are the next issue and I have been talking about these for the past six or eight months. In a place called Gneevgullia, there are five vacant houses and four of them are in that condition for more than three years. There is a house in an estate in Killarney that is vacant for more than four years. Can you imagine that? The reason that house is vacant is because the local authority will only give €11,000 and the house will cost up to €100,000 to bring it back into use. That is not good enough. The local authorities do not have the money, whatever the spin the Government is putting on it. On renting, landlords - I do not like calling them landlords but prefer calling them house owners - are getting out because of the regulations and the fact that when they want their house back, they cannot get it back. On the eviction ban, I am sorry to say to Sinn Féin, but I do not support it because that hurts the renting and will hurt it further. The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, is causing so much hardship for house owners who have been renting their houses and they are getting out because of that board. Then there is the issue of the sewerage in our towns and villages. People who cannot get planning permission out the country, who are locals themselves, cannot get it inside in the towns and villages either because there is no treatment plant. That has been highlighted by several Deputies in the House and the Government is not taking it to heart.	spk_387

It is not telling us the truth. There is no talk about compensation, and the Government just wants to ram this through. It is hitting the farmers on three fronts with these proposals: on the rewetting, on the culling of the cows and on the nitrates. What it is not talking about at all is what this is going to do to all the communities beside the farmers, as well as hurting the farmers. The housewife will pay more for her food, and there will be food scarcity. There is no thought in the world given to this. I do not expect any different from the Green Party, but I am so sorry that there are no Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael backbenchers sitting over there listening to this debate today, because this is where they should be. They have got the support of rural Ireland since the foundation of the State, and this is the way they are abdicating, and falling in behind the Green Party in what it is proposing. This will break farmers financially. I am telling that the Minister of State that it will. It will cut production, and we have read that it will hurt their income by 29%. At the same time, the Minister of State and the rest of his gang, along with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, are giving no credence at all to what carbon is being sequestered all around Ireland. He says it cannot be measured until 2027, but in the meantime, he wants to drive the farmers off the land and hurt them after they slaving and breaking their backs to drain the land.

This should not be happening at all because the companies should be charging according to what it costs them to make the electricity and taking only a reasonable profit, yet, as we know, they are making massive profits. The Government is trying to divide out their profits and gains to those whom it thinks it should, but it should go to the people who are paying the bills at, for example, 46 cent per kilowatt-hour when they should be paying only 18 cent. This has happened because of the closure of Bord na Móna in the middle of the country, jeopardising the whole energy sector, where a few of these companies are making vast sums and the Government is hoping to get a windfall tax from them to divvy out. That is very unfair. People are paying massive bills. The Government talks about inflation. The European Central Bank and others are raising their interest rates to counteract inflation, and people are paying extra on their mortgages and will be asked to pay a lot more in the hope of keeping down inflation, but inflation is caused by the cost of energy, whether that is electricity, diesel or petrol. That is where the inflation is caused. These people should not be charging the sums they are charging and should not be making massive profits. The Government then comes from behind to divvy out the gains and impose a windfall tax. That is all wrong. Ordinary people are being hurt every day of the week trying to pay these massive electricity bills, and the Government then comes along trying to be do-gooders who will pay back money to some people, when it has already taken it out of their pockets.	spk_199

We do not see much public transport. I do not know what people in the north west see by way of public transport, but we do not see it in Kerry anyway. Rather, we see big, flashy buses in Dublin, double-deckers or whatever, and one or two people at the most inside them. That is where the money is going. It is not going to Kerry to the Killarney bypass or the 673 local improvement schemes that are still on the list in Kerry. I am sure that permeates the counties the people present represent. That is what is happening. We are not getting our fair share. People are paying their motor tax and every other kind of tax, but whole lanes of traffic are choked day after day. The Government says this is supposed to help with our carbon footprint but if people are twice as long in their cars waiting to go somewhere because they are held up in traffic and the traffic will not move, the argument for that is long gone.

This is Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in action together at the behest of the Green Party. They want us to cull cows, rewet land and reduce production by other means through the nitrates directive. Last year, the Taoiseach at the time, Deputy Micheál Martin, was violent when I asked if the Government was considering reducing the number of or culling cows. The Minister denied it. Here we are today because the Green Party kept the pressure on and ensured the Government would go through with this proposal. I always thought a Minister from rural Ireland would stand by the people of rural Ireland but I am disappointed to see this proposal coming forward because this will mean a reduction in farmers' incomes and a reduction in communities at large - the rural communities that are under pressure financially as it is. After all the support Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael got over the years in rural Ireland, this is what they are doing to it. They are giving in to the Green Party even though this is not fair at all because we are giving no cognisance at all to sequestration and the amount of carbon farmers are already sequestering. They are sequestering way more carbon than a lot of them, or even most of them, are admitting. We are being told now that even growing green grass sequesters carbon. The Government is threatening food security. We are trying to get young farmers going and keep them going but they are saying this will be the kiss of death for the dairy industry. Farmers' incomes will be cut. The Government denied this last year and kept it from the farmers even though it knew that with the 25% cut in emissions, it would have to do something drastic like this. It was told that 16% or 17% would be enough but that is not even what other countries are doing. The Government is going ahead with this because it wants to pacify the Green Party and stay in power for another few months. Farmers all over the country and in Kerry have spent fortunes inside their gates, slaving in the green fields and the glens and valleys of Ireland doing hard physical work where they injure themselves and hurt their backs and spend the second half of their lives physically impeded. They have worked so hard and strived so hard and they have become the most sustainable, environmentally friendly and efficient producers of beef and dairy products in the whole world. I can see that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have little appreciation for what they have achieved and what they are doing. This will also mean a threat to our food security. It will mean an increase in the cost to the consumer and to the housewife. The Government does not have any regard for that. Who will take up the slack? Is it going to be like the peat and the briquettes from Latvia and Germany? Are the South Americans, the Brazilians who are cutting down forests, going to supply the market? We have produced food to such a high standard and have supplied food all over the world as well as feeding ourselves. There are 750 million people starving in the world. Our population is increasing and here we are suggesting we cull the cows. Indeed, Elon Musk is laughing at this. He cannot understand it. The USA is making cartoons about us and laughing at us because the Irish are cutting cow production. This is laughable. This is what they are saying. Whatever the Government does and whatever hardship it puts the people of Ireland and the farmers under, it will not change the weather. I can ensure that. The Government is hurting people. It is leaving the people who supported it over the years behind. I am very disappointed with the Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, and with the Minister. 	spk_28

We have all known for a long time that the nursing homes are in trouble. I acknowledge the presence of all the people in the Gallery, who include managers and staff from small nursing homes and Mr. Tadhg Daly who is in charge of the representative body. I also welcome Timmy Murphy from Brosna who, with his family, runs a number of small nursing homes in Dublin, Kildare and other places. These people are busy and would not be here only that they have a serious problem with funding. As has been said, they have to pay people on a Friday evening and make ends meet. It is very clear, as the Minister of State knows, that the public nursing homes are being funded to a greater extent. They receive almost 50% more and that cannot continue. I condemn the absence of the senior Minister who is not here this evening to hear this. He was here and he ran. He is gone putting labels on bottles or something that will get his name written into the history books. Since 2020, 31 family nursing homes have closed. Many of them have been running at a loss since 2022. They are concerned about their viability. They face continuous problems recruiting and retaining experienced staff. We all know what happened during Covid-19 when the HSE robbed many small nursing homes of their staff. The fair deal scheme needs to be reviewed to ensure that private nursing homes can address the individual needs of patients who need much more attention and care. Ministers know that these private nursing homes are being paid almost 50% less. That cannot continue. It will be too late when they close. One has already closed in the Kilcummin area. I thank all the nursing homes in Kerry. Close to me, we have St. Joseph's nursing home in Kenmare, and the Tír na nÓg and Our Lady of Lourdes nursing homes. We have the Willow Brooke home in Castleisland. I thank the staff working in the St. Columbanus home in Killarney and those providing long-stay beds in the community hospital in Kenmare.	spk_231
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-06-22	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_28	I wish to raise with the Minister the very serious matter of how Government policy is being fine-tuned to cut farm production by rewetting, cutting dairy cow numbers and the nitrates directive. This will impact directly on farmers’ incomes, reduce vibrancy in every sector of rural communities and impact on food security and increase the cost of food to everyone in our country. As we export high-quality food products all over the world, who is going to replace us? Will they create a greater carbon footprint globally? We are all under the same sky. Are more people going to be left to starve as over 750 million are starving in different parts of the world? Is it going to be the same story as the briquettes and peat moss, which we now import because we cannot produce them ourselves? At the same time, many farmers are sequestering carbon all over our country, more carbon than they emit. It is wrong to penalise and curtail farmers for producing when no credit or recognition is given to those who are sequestering carbon. We are being told that the measuring of sequestration will not take place until at least 2027. How can that be fair? With regard to rewetting, as proposed, this obnoxious proposal will only affect farmers who have worked hard for generations to drain and improve their land, to make their holdings more productive and to get value out of fertiliser and nutrients. Rewetting will not affect farmers in the Golden Vale of Tipperary whose lands cannot be wetted even on the wettest of days, so this rewetting is discriminating against farmers on poorer-type lands. Are we going to let more land go wild with overgrowth and scrub? We could have a scenario at some stage where thousands of acres will go on fire, with fires burning across county bounds. The Minister's party leader, the Tánaiste, lost it when I asked him over a year ago about the Government proposal to cull the dairy herd. He denied it but it is now clear that the Government is at it again. It is clear to me that the Government has no appreciation of farmers. The nitrates directive regulations will impact many dairy farms while doing very little to improve water quality, and will automatically reduce cow numbers and milk production. If they cannot buy or rent extra land, how can they even compete with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who, on behalf of the State, is on the market competing for the same land? Are we going to have more acres like the 26,000 acres in the national park in Killarney completely overrun with deer that are out of control, killing people on our roads and robbing farmers’ grazing? For decades, people were vilified and criminalised by environmentalists if they touched a deer. Now, the same environmentalists are saying that the deer will have to be culled to help biodiversity. They have no problem with the other problems they are creating.	spk_212
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-06-22	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_28	I thank the Minister for his reply. The Government is not being truthful to the farmers. It is not telling them what is needed or what is going to happen. Earlier this year, the Government agreed that farmers would have to cut their emissions by 25% and said this would be achievable. The Government should tell us what it is going to do and what farmers have to do because farmers want to know what they have to do. Farmers are already sequestering carbon and they are getting no credit for that. How can the Government say that farmers must cut production and cut their emissions when the Government does not know how much emissions they are already sequestering? That is the crucial point. The Government does not know what they are sequestering and it does not give a damn, apart from putting farmers under pressure by telling them they will have to rewet their lands and cull their cows. The Government is ambivalent about the truth. When I asked the Tánaiste over 12 months ago, he went mad, he went wild, and he said that I was making it up - I read it myself. Here we are again, and the Government still will not tell the farmers what they have to do, only that they must cut production, while at the same time they are sequestering way more carbon than they are emitting.	spk_214

Home help is something every public representative is dealing with. On an hourly basis, there is someone ringing about home help. When people get elderly and have little problems, they want to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. We should be doing a lot more to help these people stay in their homes and give them the home help they need. There are desperate anomalies. In Kerry, there are people granted home help and being notified they will get it, yet the home help does not arrive because there are no home helps available to do the physical work. We must address that issue. When we debated this issue previously, I ask about Ukrainian refugees, women and men, who should be trained up, especially those who speak English and have a car. I am sure they would want to work and could help. We should be doing more to recruit people. Sadly, last year, people were recruited and trained but were not being called. People will not stay hanging around like that when they are looking for work after training and everything. It takes too long. I do not know where the knots are. We have a situation where people are in hospitals and the hospital wants to get them out and get the bed free but there is no one to come at that moment to do the home help. It is a fierce worry for elderly people. The one thing they want is to stay in their homes for as long as they can. We are not doing enough to help them.	spk_43

The youth are our future and as has been said, it is very important to keep them active and working. We appreciate all of the voluntary groups that help youth, whether it is the local youth groups in Kenmare, Kilgarvan, Glenflesk or wherever. All of those people do great work with the youth, and they know them by name. In the GAA clubs, the underage teams are very active both in hurling and football in Kerry, all over the county. There are clubs that never played hurling now training their young fellows and girls to play hurling as well. The strategy falls short in addressing the socioeconomic factors that contribute to youth crime. It does not propose sufficient measures to address inequality, poverty and the lack of educational opportunities, which are often root causes of criminal behaviour among young people. Without addressing these systematic issues, any efforts to reduce youth crime are likely to yield limited results. We must keep our youth busy, and keep them happy and active in sports. The Kerry Diocesan Youth Service, KDYS, is a magnificent organisation. It does so much work all around the county, in Castleisland, Killorglin and Killarney. It does massive work with young people. The drugs issue is something that is prevalent even in every small parish now, and we must ensure that we help the Garda to combat this in whatever way we can. When it gets hold of young people, it does untold damage. We have to ensure that young fellows and girls have enough to do. It has been highlighted to me that so many discos and similar places are closed now, and we only have them in the bigger towns, rather than the smaller towns.	spk_236

Since then, the council has received no reply. I also want to highlight that old fallen timber in 26 acres of the Killarney National Park is a habitat for Lyme disease.

Equal treatment of all has to be respected. However, like many others, I am very concerned about what is happening to minors, the early transitioning of minors, the shift in focus at Pride events, the influence of the transgender movement on minors and potential connections to paedophilia advocacy, the lack of scientific evidence for medical interventions, the denial of biological reality, the role of political, academic and corporate elites, the impact on women's sports, censorship of opposing views and the inclusion of gender-related primary school curriculum. It also highlight the emphasis on support, love and psychological treatment for children and the fear of being labelled as bigots. On the early transitioning of minors, I think it is wrong that teachers in primary schools have been advised by Ireland's National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, a part of the Department of Education, to incorporate topics such as cross-dressing, drag and various gender identities into the primary school curriculum. That is totally wrong. Teachers are discouraged from using the phrase ""boys and girls"". We have to respect nature. It is very wrong to be confusing young children into making them feel that they are not sure whether they are boys or girls. The time will come when they will grow up to decide. Parents and parents alone have the role in helping their children along the way and helping them to develop. They know when it is right to teach children the way of life and the way ahead. It is very confusing this thing about using same-sex toilets for boys and girls. It leaves the door open for vulnerable children to be bullied or harassed. That is something that we must all seek to ensure does not happen. Again Minister, we have to respect nature. Until such time that boys or girls, whatever, whenever they decide or if they ever decide that they want to change, they should be grown up enough to do that. Surely we are not going to tell children that 25 December is not going to come this year or next year."	spk_158

Every one of us elected here recognises that we must assist people in every way to ensure that our children can access education. Whether this is in primary school, secondary school or at third level, we must ensure it is available and accessible to all children. There is no question in this regard about every boy and girl who got up this morning and went to school. Some are finished now for the holidays and we wish them all the very best for their bit of a break. Many of them are working to assist their parents to provide the funding to ensure they can go to school in the fall of the year in September. I have also had people ringing me about accessing the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant. It is a constant worry and bother to those parents, whether they have one, two or three children. The costs mount as the numbers increase. It is very difficult for some of these parents to meet the bills they must pay. Additionally, accommodation costs in Limerick and Cork are exorbitant. Can we imagine that students from Kerry were driving up and down to Cork and Limerick during the last fall of the year when they could not get accommodation at all or could not pay for it? This is not acceptable and we must ensure this does not happen in future. Last year, about this time, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, announced that every child would have free transport to national schools. Yet we knew the preparations had not been made for that to happen. The school bus transport in Tralee, in our county, was not ready for this or preparations had not been made in this regard. We all know how hard it is to get drivers and contractors and to ensure that they have buses up to standard. It was very unfair and not thought out very well. It was laid out that every child going to national school would have free transport, but in reality that is not what happened. It is a struggle to ensure that those travelling beyond two miles have school transport. It is hard to organise this and to get it going, but I believe that all those who are beyond two miles are entitled to this free school transport on a bus. I say this because in a place like Kilgarvan four national schools have already closed. A commitment was given by the Department of Education at that time that all those children from those areas where the schools had been closed would be transported to the central school, which is Kilgarvan Central School. Sadly, though, it is a struggle to ensure that those children get this transport all the time and that this service is maintained. It may lapse for a time. No children might be coming from the Gortaloughane area in Kilgarvan, for example.All of a sudden a family arrives and transport needs to start again. There is a reluctance to ensure that families are accommodated. That is why I worry about Governments that make statements that children will always be transported because the next Government that comes into office seems to forget that. As long as we are elected here to represent the people, we will keep reminding the Government that those commitments were given in every parish. As well as Kilgarvan, they were given in Gneeveguilla where Tureencahill closed. Other schools were closed. If the Government does not do that, it is neglecting rural Ireland. People cannot live in those areas if they do not have a car.	spk_184

I have been an employer for many years and as an employer I know too well that Friday evening comes very fast. I believe in paying people equally for the same type of work but there is a thing called starting off and training people and getting them used to rules and regulations. They have to be up for that. In all this talk, we have to appreciate employers in the same way as we appreciate workers. We are in the market now and the workers are in that market. If the workers are not paid properly, they will not stay and that is a fact. Yes, we have to recognise equal pay for equal work but we also have to recognise that youngsters have to be trained. I love youngsters starting off. I love giving them a job and my son carries on in the same vein in work today. We must appreciate the employers as well because if employers are left to pay an exorbitant rate from the very start, they will employ fewer people. There is only so much money to go around to make ends meet. I do not know how many people the Members have employed in their time. I value employing people. I recognise that I have to pay them and they will have to be paid because their families depend on them. Whether it is a young lad making a few bob to go back to college or back to school, they all need their money and they have to get it. If employers do not pay them, they will not stay with that employer. That is a fact. This is only a publicity stunt.	spk_43

Again, that issue is at the top of my list. Deputy Ring made a good case for Fine Gael here tonight but I have to remind him that all of the money he is talking about which is being given out has been collected off the taxpayers and off the people who are out early in the morning and who are paying through the nose for gallons of diesel and litres of petrol for fuel to try to keep going. There are paying exorbitant taxes. The Government has angered many people in our county who cannot get planning permission, which is the basic right just to put a roof over your head. Much of Kerry is now a no-go area as far as getting planning permission is concerned. I have asked on several days to have this examined and to control the Planning Regulator because he has our county development plan ruined. Many people just cannot get planning permission and they have paid for it, even though they have paid almost a third of taxes, VAT and levies to build their own house, which they are not being allowed to do. The Government has people driven mad about this rewetting and culling cows, and it has no appreciation at all. For the Green Party, however, it is wagging the tail and it has no appreciation of our farmers and of what they are going through. The Government will not consider the amount of carbon emissions farmers are already sequestering and is saying this will not be measured until 2027. Tourism is adversely affected because the Government brought in all of these refugees but it did not get any place for them except hotels.	spk_263

I thank Sinn Féin for giving us the opportunity to talk about this very important matter with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kieran O'Donnell. We have great firefighters in Kerry and we need them. We need them to stay in their jobs. Right around the Ring of Kerry, from Sneem, Kenmare, Killarney, Cahersiveen, Killorglin, Listowel to Tralee, we depend so much on these brave men and women for the great work that they do. I put it to the Minister that their work is not only fires; it is also serious accidents and tragedies. They deal with hill climbers and people on the lakes. There is something happening all of the time and we need these trained people who have expertise in their jobs. Sadly, there are no Mother Teresas now and they need to be properly paid. Another issue highlighted to me is that these people are supposed to be part time, but they cannot live on that part-time money. Sometimes they must have other income because they must keep going and keep their families going. The few extra bob they get puts them into the higher tax bracket. The Government needs to do something about that to ensure the payment they get as firefighters should be sacrosanct and should not be taxed, or they should get some special treatment for that money, so it is not added onto the other income they have. What they are getting for firefighting is a pittance when one takes the tax out of the extra money if they go into the higher tax bracket. We need these people - people like Teddy McCarthy in Sneem who knows the terrain and knows everything that goes on in the whole district he works in. These people cannot go more than 3 km from their homes. It is like being shackled to the bed. If they are putting their children to bed and their buzzer goes off and the wife is gone to the shop, what do they do? If they are putting their mother or father to bed, what do they do? They must drop everything and take to the road and make themselves available to help other people and to save other lives. We must appreciate these people. They have to be properly paid and the Government must do something about the tax they are paying on the extra money that they get.	spk_174

I will outline first the deep concern expressed by many farmers in rural areas, especially in rural Kerry. The farmers whose lands people are talking about rewetting are the farmers who are working the hardest. They drained their land and were encouraged to do so to make it productive back in the 1960s, the early 1970s and through the 1980s. They were grant-aided to do that and they worked very hard to make their land productive. It is very hurtful now for them to hear people in government or advising Government, or whatever, saying that these lands should be rewetted in the name of biodiversity. That will actually spell the end of their livelihoods if that goes through. However, it has stalled in recent times in Europe. I believe that a vote was lost by the people proposing the rewetting. I believe that another vote is due to take place in the next few days. I was glad to hear the Taoiseach today outline his view on rewetting. He said that it should only be voluntary and that farmers should be compensated if they decide to go for this scheme. I have a problem with that, although it is good to hear him saying it in the first place. If a farmer in the middle of a flat low-lying place decides that he wants to flood or rewet his place, he will probably rewet his neighbours on one side of him or on both sides. You could have problems because of that. This is unfair because when you talk about rewetting, you are only talking about people on these low-lying lands. Then you have people in the Golden Vale with free-draining soil, and you have mountainy places which will not be affected at all. In the 1940s and early 1950s, the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 helped people in places like north Kerry to drain almost 26,000 acres of land, which is now highly productive land. The communities around there have enjoyed the spin-off from good farming practices over the years in the villages, the shops, the garages and the entire community. Then there is the proposal to carry out maintenance. We have 1,172 submissions from the likes of An Taisce, Bat Conservation Ireland, BirdWatch Ireland and so on. All of these groups - I will not call them ""do-gooders"" - are aided and funded by the Government. These organisations have lodged professional submissions against what the OPW and the farming community have in mind and want to do to ensure that maintenance is continued into the future at the Cashen outlet, which has silted up by more than a metre from what it was. There are proposals for 16 pumps driven by wind energy because they cannot carry out the drainage in the manner they have done previously due to the fact that the Cashen outlet is in a special area of conservation."	spk_291

I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for the opportunity. The biggest problem we have in Kerry at present is that people who want to build their own houses are being blocked by the planning regulator. This has been a serious issue since last June. Many people in their own areas cannot get permission because of urban-generated pressure. These are not people coming out from Killarney town, Killorglin town, Tralee town or Dingle town. They are people who are already out there but do not own a farm. Because they are not a farmer's son or daughter they are not entitled to apply for permission. They have lived next door to the farmer all their lives. They are rural people. They can buy a site but they will not be considered for planning because of this urban-generated pressure. The planning regulator insisted that the area under this zoning was expanded. Then we have the national primary roads and national secondary roads where people cannot come out through an existing entrance. Farmers' sons and daughters are included in this. They cannot come out onto the road. They are being denied the right to apply for planning permission. These are people who want to build a house for themselves. Then we have Government taxes and levies that are making it impossible for people to meet the cost. It is absolutely impossible and nothing is being done about it. These are people who want to build their own houses. I am speaking about Kerry where it is a serious problem. I am asking the Minister to do something about it.	spk_43

It is the people on marginal land who had to work and drain their land to make it productive who will be hurt. We cannot flood fertile land. We cannot flood the plains of County Kildare, the Golden Vale in County Tipperary, east Cork or Limerick, but the Government will try to do it in south and north Kerry, which Deputy Michael Healy-Rae mentioned. The poor farmers slave day and night in their fields alone, and sometimes with their wives and families, to try to help make land productive. This is what the Government is standing by and trying to force through without showing any clear understanding of what it is at. It is not telling the people what is happening. The new term being used is ""nature restoration"", but it started out with rewetting. It is horrible. What the Government is trying to do to poor people who made their land productive is to make it unproductive so they will have to vacate it.  I want to ask the Ceann Comhairle one question.

There is nothing to top the joy of a newborn baby for a couple when they are lucky enough for that to happen. When something is wrong, however, and they discover that something is not right with the child, it can be a really big problem and, in some cases, it is a burden they must carry all of their lives until they depart from this life, and they must wonder what will happen to their son or their daughter. That is a big worry for those people. The figures here are massive and it must be treated as an emergency. I am aware that some months ago I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, about this. We need to find out what is the cause of the increase in these levels of autism problems. We are not helping people. There are delays for assessments and for all of the therapies. We just do not have enough people. This is an important enough debate to have the senior Minister here, but he would rather be putting labels on bottles. That is his priority to write his name into history. Our priority is to deal with this issue. It is a serious matter. We must come to grips with it by providing enough help for those couples who have children with different developmental issues. We certainly need to get them assessed in time. It has been proven that those who are assessed and those who are helped may have a normal life. We need to do a lot of work in this regard and we need to get cracking.	spk_40

We know what the farmers would like. Deputy McNamara said we know what the farmers are getting at any time, we know what the consumers are paying at any time, but we do not know what is happening in between. A year or so ago, farmers' costs rose dramatically, mainly fertiliser costs and the cost of diesel, oil and anything connected with oil such as plastics for silage bales and plastic covering. They are all still practically double what they were in 2021. Even the white diesel has not come down in proportion to petrol. White diesel has come down. I have been calling for transparency in this for quite a while now. I cannot understand how, when the cost of oil started to go up, green diesel and home heating oil were all around 38 cent a litre, they went up gradually and crept up to 90 cent a litre, and then all of a sudden they went up to €1.48 a litre. That was practically three and a half times the original cost but yet it has not gone down to €1 today. We will see now. Following the increase in the farmers' costs, they had to put up the cost of their produce and, accordingly, the consumer paid the resultant cost included. Whatever cost was decided to be put on by the retailers or by the multinational supermarkets, we do not know how they came to decide the cost they were charging for the litre of milk, the loaf of bread or whatever. All those food items increased dramatically. Now we see that, taking the milk alone, they are reducing it but the price to the farmer is reduced dramatically. Farmers borrowed to improve their systems and it is only a few years since they were told to increase production. When they are in that vein, they have to continue. It is not like a water tap they can turn off. When they are in a mode, they have to remain going. I am saying to the Minister that we need regulation and transparency as to what is happening in between with the multinationals. Of course they are collaborating because if one of them drops the price, they all seem to be able to do it. Then when they increase it, they all seem to be able to do it. I wonder what kind of trading practices they are subscribing to. Producers depend so much on the last cent they get for their produce to remain viable and keep going. Farmers are at times lambasted for getting payments in the post and it is said that they are being seen after, but we know, as do others, that is only compensation for not being paid properly for the produce in the first place. All those things need to be taken into account. We see the price of milk has reduced so much in a few months and we need to get to the root of it to see what is happening because farmers' costs are still very substantial.The price of white diesel has reduced somewhat, but the price of fertiliser is still double what it was in 2021, before the co-operatives and the sources of fertiliser raised their prices. They had bought it at a low price in 2021 and held it back until the spring of 2022, when they doubled and trebled the cost of it. I have been calling for some kind of an investigation into what is going on in that regard because farmers are hit when something like this happens, but so too are consumers. Everyone is complaining about the cost of food. It is still very expensive and wages are not going as far as they were. The increases in these prices have a domino effect. I will support Deputy McNamara's amendment. We need to know what is happening between when the product leaves the farmer's gate and when the housewife buys it over the shop counter. An awful lot happens in between. Any regulator needs to have power to suss out what is going on and ensure fairness will be applied both ways, that is, to the farmer and to the housewife.	spk_236

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-05-24	dail	33	Agriculture and Food Supply Chain Bill 2022: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage	dbsect_20	We need to give the agrifood regulator teeth to investigate certain rules that apply at meat factories, such as the four-movement rule. My contention and that of all the farmers is that the four-movement rule is unfair, as is the 30-month rule whereby farmers are penalised when cattle are more than 30 months of age by the time they go to the factory. I have been raising these issues for many years. When a carcass is hanging off the rafters, how do you know what age that animal was? That rule is totally unfair, as is the four-movement rule. The factories need to be challenged about those two issues. They need to be made to give an explanation. I firmly believe they would get the same price for beef that does not comply with these rules as they get for beef that is under 30 months or for the cattle that do not go over the four movements. We need to get an honest answer to that because farmers are being penalised unfairly. The other aspect affecting farmers in regard to beef relates to cases where an animal is not the right colour. The right colour at the present time is a gold or white Charolais or a red Limousin. An animal can be equally good if it is a grey Charolais or a black Limousin. According to the farmers, and I believe them, there is no reason cattle of the same weight or the same quality should not make the same price. That needs to be investigated because farmers are suffering because of colour. That is very unfair. We need to give the regulator the powers to follow up these matters because this is the difference between a producer making a few bob or not doing so. There are inconsistencies that need to be investigated. If this regulator is going to be worth his salary, he needs to have powers to follow up those matters. To me and to many others, these issues do not make any sense. The rules or ideals that they seem to be following are hurting farmers and producers. When people have the steak on their plate or a bit of boiling beef in the pot, I do not believe they know what colour the skin of the animal was before it was slaughtered. Fairness needs to be seen to be carried out in this regard. There are many other issues that need to be questioned. I am still asking at this late stage why the cost of green diesel has not come down. I ask the Minister to follow that up because so many farmers cannot understand why it is double the cost of what it should be.	spk_245

The fifth quarter is every other bit of the carcase, which the farmer does not get paid for, yet the factories are getting paid for that. If this food regulator is to have any real purpose or benefit to farmers, the regulator needs to go after that issue because farmers are being short-changed. They are not paid for all of the animal. They are not paid properly at times even for the part of the animal they are being paid for. They never get paid for the fifth quarter. Factories are raking it in in this regard. They need to be followed up to see about it. We appear not to have had any power to follow this before. I ask the Minister to give the regulator the power to follow these people. They are all doing the same thing and they are acting like a cartel. Someone used to say that if it waggles like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck. There is something going on there with these factories. It seems an eternity ago since we raised this and since the farmers had to go through these protests and do nights and days out in the rain and the cold. We appreciate the struggle they went through at that time.

A short few weeks ago I asked the Taoiseach in this Chamber about the restrictions preventing people from getting planning permission where they wish to have exits from their houses and where an exit already exists onto national primary and secondary roads in Kerry. The Taoiseach agreed with me at that time that a blanket ban was not the correct way to administer restrictions that were put in place back in 2012 by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and signed by the relevant Ministers, one of whom was Deputy Varadkar. This forced councils to administer these restrictions on national roads with speeds of more than 60 km/h. We have more kilometres of national roads than most counties, with 100 km of national primary roads and 300 km of national secondary roads. We have more than most counties and others have motorways and their former national roads are now regional roads, for which these restrictions do not apply. We have no motorways in Kerry and the Ring of Kerry road was built in the 1800s. In the 2015 to 2020 county development plan, we agreed exemptions with Transport Infrastructure Ireland for some of the secondary roads but it objected to these in our new 2022 plan. The sons and daughters of farmers cannot get planning permission if their exiting roads are not in the charge of the local authorities. The planning regulator has insisted that under the new county development plan, more areas are to be designated to be under significant urban influence. These areas are expanded, which means that many applicants who have been born in or lived in an area for all their lives cannot get permission to build homes there. Where are these people to go? They are over the income thresholds for social housing and they cannot afford houses on sites in towns like Killarney, Kenmare, Killorglin or Dingle. Where are they to go? I am asking the Taoiseach what the Government will do to help these people. The Government will have to do something about anonymous objectors. They should be made to identify themselves and they should have to pay a more realistic fee. With the way application and building costs have gone, €20 is not enough. They should be charged from €500 to €2,500, and maybe that would make them cop on a bit.	spk_34
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-05-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_3	Does the Taoiseach want to blackguard me and the people of Kerry with the answer that he is after giving me there, because he answered very little of what I asked? He travelled to Tipperary and other places and talked about goodies that he says he is carrying around the country. I am talking about the Ring of Kerry and the national primary and secondary routes where people are totally denied the opportunity even to apply for planning permission. They cannot apply for it. The Taoiseach agreed with me the last time I raised this that a complete ban was the wrong way to go. He promised that he would do something about it and he would talk to someone. He has talked to no one and he does not want to do anything about it. The other issue that I have raised was the expansion of areas that are under significant urban pressure away out from towns like Killarney, Kenmare and Kilorglin. People cannot get planning permission in these places to build a house for themselves to put a roof over their heads. The Taoiseach is standing here presiding over this. He signed the directive into law back in 2012 when he was either Minister for transport or the environment - one or the other. He gave the powers to Ground Investigations Ireland, GII, to stop people from using existing entrances. This is what the Government is doing in Kerry, and in most of Kerry between the national park and the national roads. There is another road that has not been built at all yet. There are four different routes. The Killarney bypass project is still in abeyance, all the people in that area cannot apply for planning permission and the Government is doing nothing about it. I have raised the issue several times, and what does the Taoiseach come back with? That he was in Tipperary last Saturday or last Friday. He should stay in Tipperary or stay up here, because he does not want to know anything about Kerry anyway.	spk_36
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-05-23	dail	33	Accommodation Needs for New Arrivals: Statements	dbsect_9	I have nothing at all against refugees or asylum seekers. How could I have anything against people I do not even know? We all feel for people who are fleeing war and conflict in other countries. However, it is clear this Government has an open-door policy, but it has not accommodation sorted out and services like doctors, teachers, schools and all those things in place. The Government landed over 4,000 extra people into Killarney without having one extra doctor. That is not fair on the people who have lived all their lives in Killarney and the surrounding areas, but it is also not fair on the refugees and asylum seekers. I need not pass Killarney to realise that the Government is not up to it. We saw what happened in the hotel on Park Road. Refugee women and children were going to school, and they had integrated. Then, the Government decided they must be taken out of that facility, and it put in 400 asylums seekers from 14 different countries. On New Year's night, they stabbed each other and they fought and there were court cases. People were terrified. There were ambulances and Garda cars around the place like they had never seen before. That is not acceptable. Until such time as the Government has accommodation in place and proper services, please, it has to call a halt. It has to look after the number of people who are here and stop at that. Until the Government has things sorted out, we cannot have people on the streets. It is making a show of us.	spk_180
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-05-23	dail	33	Hospital Waiting Lists: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_10	I thank Sinn Féin for introducing this motion. I mean no slight on the Minister of State, but it is a shame and disgrace that the Minister for Health is not here. There is no excuse good enough for that. He has been playing to the gallery all the week. He launched some initiative to put ads on bottles, drinks or whatever and announced that Ireland is the first country in the world to do that. At the same time, this Government is suggesting that pubs in cities should remain open until 6 a.m. That is a complete contradiction. The Government should insist that hospitals and medical staff work through the night and at the weekends in order to deal with the list that is there, because people get sick after 5 p.m. on Fridays and at weekends. People are dying because they cannot get attention if they go into the hospital during the off hours. There are no doctors there to see them and they remain on trolleys. That is unfair and very wrong. I am proud of the following example. Six weeks ago a 98-year-old woman got on a bus in Killarney at 3.45 a.m. She told me she wanted to save her sight. I am proud that she came back home after a seven-hour journey up to Belfast and a seven-hour journey back. She had the sight in one eye and she is going again to get the second eye done. She is 98 years of age. It is hard on those people to do those things, but that is what we have to do to ensure that they do not go blind. It is a shame, a disgrace and indictment on the Government that this is what it is allowing to happen.	spk_215

I thank Deputy Brady for doing the work and bringing it forward. This Bill aims to prevent the National Treasury Management Agency from investing in businesses that operate in illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land. I support this aim. We know our own story. We were an oppressed nation for 700 or 800 years and these people are clearly also being oppressed. Sadly, children are being killed every day. Even though I do respect our neutrality, I refer to a situation where we do not have an army and we cannot even find out what the Russian boats are doing off the coast of Castletownbere or Dingle. Today, 75 years after the UN voted to divide Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, Palestinians are still waiting for one. While Israelis celebrate 14 May 1948 as their Independence Day, Palestinians bemoan it as a catastrophe, when some 700,000 of them were forced from their homes or just fled. Israel now practically rules over 7 million Palestinians, including those in Israel, and in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which are internationally regarded as the basis of an independent Palestinian state. The UN voted to divide the country but at the same time, that organisation is abdicating its role to ensure that fairness is applied on both sides. I reiterate that I respect our neutrality and we certainly thank Eamon de Valera for taking that stance back during the Second World War when England was trying to drag us into it, especially after what it had done to our forefathers over hundreds of years. He did the right thing. Many ordinary, down-to-earth people appreciate our neutrality and they understand it. We are not even paying the personnel in our Army properly. It is not so long ago since they had to get family income supplement to supplement their incomes. We do not, therefore, have an army as such, but I do support this motion. We should not be causing pain to or hurting Palestinians any further by taking the side of the Israelis.	spk_276
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-05-10	dail	33	Wastewater Treatment	dbsect_3	I am back again to raise the issue of Kilcummin and to ask the Minister to reconsider the request to waive the connection fee to connect residents to the new Kilcummin sewerage scheme, which is currently under construction. I ask this in light of the positive decision a couple of weeks ago by the Government to waive levies and fees in certain instances.I want this scheme for the people of Kilcummin to be included and the levies and fees waived. It is the first scheme I know about that Irish Water is carrying out in Kerry. Heretofore, Kerry County Council always waived the connection fee. It put the pipe up to the boundary fence, wall, wire or whatever and people could connect to it. Even after that, there is considerable cost to bring the connection to the house. The purpose of the scheme is to protect the lakes of Killarney. Many councillors, including me when I was a councillor, have been fighting this case for more than 20 years. The scheme is now being done in some way. The whole place is uprooted and residents have gone mad. There have been residents' meetings because the traffic up there is unbelievable. They cannot come down the main road they used to use. Instead, they are using back roads. There are lorries going off roads into dykes and cars are being broken. The whole place is a mess. Irish Water is saying the residents can pay €3,900 at a later stage but that is out the window if the depth is more than 2 m or 3 m. Many of the areas on the road in question are between 5 m and 7 m down. The cost will increase way more once the depth is more than 2.5 m or whatever. Irish Water can charge whatever it likes. That means many of these people will never be able to connect to the scheme. There are between 50 and 70 houses affected. This is vital. I raised the issue with the Taoiseach and he told me he would speak to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien. When I raised it with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who is present, he said he would speak to the Minister and the Taoiseach. The Government is forgoing the levies in other instances and that is great - I am delighted about it - but these people should be entitled to the same. At present, many of them do not have the €3,900 needed. When the ground is open, very little work is needed to bring the pipe up to the fence. Another issue is that once you go down 5 m or 7 m, there is a fierce problem, which is that the ground keeps falling in because it is gravel. The Killarney and Kilcummin areas are all gravel and it is falling in. Many people are asking why the pipe is not being drilled underground as is done in other places. If that had been done in Kilcummin, there would be far less trouble for the residents. I am told Kilcummin is the biggest parish in Ireland. It is one of the biggest parishes anyway. There are a serious number of people travelling to schools or nursing homes. It is close to Killarney town. The way this is being done is ridiculous. There is a lot of hullabaloo and work is going on but no one is connecting to the sewer. We are trying to protect the lakes of Killarney.	spk_10
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-05-10	dail	33	Wastewater Treatment	dbsect_3	The Minister of State and the Government are throwing it over to Irish Water but they will take credit for what is being done and for the money they have given. I am asking for the connection fee to be waived. I have been involved in schemes like this all my life. My family is still involved in doing the schemes. I know what the cost of the scheme would be. There is no way in the world Irish Water could charge €20,000 more per connection to install the pipe for 50 to 70 houses. The Minister of State should check it out. Why is Irish Water saving this miserly sum of money and putting people to the torment of what is going on but achieving nothing? The Minister of State is saying it will protect the lakes of Killarney and the River Deenagh. It will do so in the context of the village above but the 50 or 70 houses down the road are not being facilitated at all to connect up with the Killarney pipe. It does not make an ounce of sense, if it was priced at €10,000 but charged at €20,000 for the connection. The Government is talking about building houses. There are vacant houses along that road that need to be connected but the owners cannot afford the cost at this time. I am appealing to those in government to put their heads together. The Government - Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party - is looking for credit but, God almighty, can it not see what could be done for this small sum of money? The trench is open and all that has to be done is for the pipe to be connected to it. There is no digging needed. Irish Water should run the pipe up to the boundary fence and leave it there. I am asking for no more. The people in question will have to pay enough money to bring it to their houses anyway. There are septic tanks in trouble up there but the Government is giving no help to protect the River Deenagh or the lakes of Killarney in this instance.	spk_12

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-05-10	dail	33	Planning and Rural Housing: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	I am sharing time with Deputy Nolan. I am not exaggerating when I say planning permission in Kerry is very difficult to obtain at present and is becoming more and more difficult as the days go on. I have raised previously with the Taoiseach the issue of national primary and national secondary roads. It is ironic to think it was he who gave TII the powers in 2013, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, that have prevented a whole lot of people and families, whether they are farmers or relatives of farmers, from getting permission to exit through their own entrance onto a national primary or national secondary road, even if there is an existing entrance. In the most recent debate I had with the Taoiseach, he stated he did not agree with a blanket ban. Engineers in Kerry County Council know the rules and regulations as regards safety when coming onto such a road and the distances outside that are required but, as it stands, there is no planning to be had along a national primary or national secondary road. We have somewhere between 450 miles and 500 miles of national primary and national secondary roads. That is the extent to which people are deprived. Kerry has more miles of that category of road than any other county, given there are motorways going through the rest of them. If someone were coming out onto a county council road that has been taken in charge, they could access the primary road no bother, but if they were coming out with right of way where there were, say, 20 houses and the road had not been taken in charge, such a person would be denied the right even to apply for planning permission and it would be a waste of time. In Killarney, we are further impacted by the national park to the south of the town. A Minister stated in the Chamber the other day that he was going to issue a compulsory purchase order, CPO, for more lands around the 26,000 acres we have in Killarney already. When is enough enough? People are trying to provide houses for themselves. Then there is the scenario where the proposed route for the new Killarney bypass, from Farranfore to Lissyviggeen and from Lissyviggeen to the Kenmare road coming into Killarney, has been going on for 20 years and about four routes have been proposed. Hundreds of acres have been sterilised. People cannot apply for planning permission. When they ask TII whether their site is within that range, hundreds of fellas have been denied the right again to apply. Other areas are under significant urban pressure. On the instructions of the Planning Regulator, a whole lot of additional lands in Kilcummin, Teernaboul and into Rathmore and Barraduff have been placed under significant urban pressure, which means that only a farmer's son or daughter can get planning permission, yet the young fella next door might have lived all his life there. It is like the girl in Kilcummin the other day who had found a site 1 km away from her home. She lives 10 miles out from Killarney. She has no hope of getting planning permission. No services are coming out there. She just wants to build a house to be near her parents. The only place to go is into towns or villages, but then there are no treatment plants. We have a whole raft of them, up to 30, waiting to be rejuvenated or extended or, in places such as Scartaglin or Curragh, to get a treatment plant. They do not have one. I appeal to the Minister to do something to allow people to get planning permission or to make it easier. These people will build the house themselves and pay for it, but they are finding it impossible to get planning permission. Their only option at present, in that vast area, is to go into Killarney to try to buy a house for €700,000. That is not on. The people of Kerry, including east Kerry, are totally blackguarded.	spk_59

Now, when people are complaining, it is the farmers who will be hit. They have already been asked to reduce the price of milk. It went down by 12 cent to 15 cent per litre in most co-operatives over the past three months. In talking about those co-operatives, we should note there was no regulation of the cost of fertiliser. The suppliers were not taken to task for what they were charging. Only for the suppliers in the north of Ireland bringing down the cost of fertiliser, it would not have come down here. That is God's gospel truth. There should be some regulation or some come-hither put on these fellas because they have made billions out of it. They are saying they bought the fertiliser dear last fall and must sell it off, yet they bought it the year before, in 2021, at a cheaper price and got a big price for it all last year. Plastic for silage is €260 per roll but was €130 per roll. The rolls for the balers were €70 but are now €140. I hear an egg costs a dollar in California.We will not be far behind them the way farmers' costs are going. Look at green diesel. It is still €1.20 per litre when it used to be 38 cent before the war and everything else the war is blamed for. It is now €1.20 and it has not come down proportionately as the price of petrol and white diesel have come down	spk_164

As has been said already, it has been importing peat from Latvia and it also imported coal from Russia to keep the Tarbert plant going. Since Shannonbridge and Lanesborough were closed, the cost of electricity has gone up every day. A new compensation payment scheme for farmers - the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES - stipulates that if you cut turf on your land, your farm payments will be cut. How can the Government justify this, in light of the fact that we are all under the one sky whether we are in Brazil, China, Russia, Latvia or anywhere else?

It is a fact that the exorbitant cost of electricity has driven many people demented. The Minister of State's buddy, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is specifically responsible for not ensuring the energy regulator does its job. The regulator has not done its job and there has been no account from the regulator through all this unmitigated mess. Other countries put a cap on the electricity. We asked the Government to do the same, day after day in this Chamber. The Government totally rubbished it and would not listen to us. People have gone through hell and back trying to survive. People depend on electricity. I had one elderly woman last year who was afraid to boil the kettle because of the bills she was getting. Then the Government is telling people they should not cut turf. It is trying to bring in that measure by the back door now by having something in the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, saying farmers cannot cut turf and if they do, their payments will be cut. I appreciate people around the country, but especially in Kerry, who cut turf to keep themselves warm. We have done it ourselves on our farm since the 1800s. I can go back that far. We will continue to do it while we live, and my family are at it now as well. I wish the people of Kerry well and tell them all to get out now and cut turf and not have their finger inside the Government's mouth for electricity. The Government is telling people to put in heat pumps when they cannot pay the bills because of those heat pumps.	spk_227
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-04-26	dail	33	Rent Reduction Bill 2023: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_7	As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae declared an interest, I will declare that I am his brother but I will tell the House honestly and truly that I will not benefit in any way from his interest. I am glad to raise a few matters with the Minister of State. While Deputy Michael Healy-Rae gave an example of a rent of €1,000 - it can be more than that at times in Killarney - in many parts of Kerry, a property will not get more than €600 per month in rent. When that is sized up for people who own one or two houses, when they pay the tax they are left with half or perhaps less than half of that. After they pay the insurance, they are down to approximately €250 or €300. It is not worth their while. The other issue is that if they rent out houses, they are worried they will not be able to get them back when they want. Something must be done about that. I have already spoken to the Minister of State about it. I know he is interested in doing his best in the brief he has and we will all work with him. However, something must be done about the lack of confidence among landowners or landlords. I do not like calling them landlords. I will call them house owners. They are afraid. They will not rent out their properties because they cannot get their houses back. Could the council get involved even for people who are not on the list? The council could rent from the house owner and the tenant would rent from the council or some such authority that house owners would know they would get their houses back from. The tax-free payment of €800 that is given to people who accommodate Ukrainians should go to people who are trying to house our own people. It is important.	spk_40
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-04-26	dail	33	Agricultural and Food Supply Chain Bill 2022: Report Stage	dbsect_37	Food security is paramount to everyone, not alone the farmers but also the consumers. We all see what happened with the fertiliser. It is my belief that the cartel operated by the larger co-ops in this country have ensured that the cost of fertiliser went to the highest that it could. This year, even with the price of gas coming down, we see they are still trying to make the argument that because they bought the fertiliser at the back end of last year, 2022, that they are entitled to charge as much as they can get for it now. If it was not for the fact that fertiliser became available at a cheaper price in the North of Ireland and that we could see the same thing was happening in the UK, it would still be at an exorbitant price. These co-ops are telling us that they bought this year’s fertiliser at a dear price at the back end of 2022. They did not tell us that they bought the fertiliser at a much cheaper price at the end of 2021 and they held on to it. They would not even quote or give it out in March last year until the price went up further. This is unfair trading. It is treating our farmers with contempt and treating the consumers and the housewife with contempt. That is what has happened. The farmers could not sustain the extra cost without driving up the cost of their produce as they finish it and produce it; they had to drive up the cost to cover their own expense whether it is dairy, beef or whatever.  I am asking the Minister and the Minister of State here to carry out a high-level investigation on these co-ops. When we talk about the larger co-ops, these are the very people who have been trying to stop their suppliers from supplying the smaller merchants recently. We thank those smaller merchants for supplying fertiliser much more cheaply than the larger co-ops. There is and has been unfair trading going on in this and it has to be called out. The Minister has to do something about it. I raised it with the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, a couple of months ago. He came back to me with a letter following my question to him during Leaders’ Questions saying that these co-ops were justified in charging what they are charging because they bought it dear at the end of last year but he was not able to go back far enough to see what happened at the end of 2021. I am calling on both of the Ministers to do something about this and ensure that something like this never happens in this country again.  I am also calling for an investigation into another matter, namely the cost of green diesel. Farmers cannot operate without green diesel. The price of green diesel went up way higher per litre than white diesel. There is no difference in the quality of white diesel and green diesel for driving whether it is a lorry or tractor. The only difference is the dye that is put into it. I cannot understand and farmers cannot understand why green diesel is at a cost that it should not be. We are thankful that the cost of road diesel and petrol has reduced but it needs to be reduced more. At the same time, green diesel has not gone down to the level that it should. We still know that something has happened and we need to get an explanation for the farmers because again, the farmers cannot sustain the extra cost onto the food that they are producing. Here in this Chamber, I want to thank our farmers right around the country for the wonderful food that they are supplying, whether dairy, beef or whatever, at the highest level and the highest standard. They are maintaining their environment requirements to the highest standard. I resent and reject the Citizens’ Assembly on Biodiversity Loss that is insisting that farmers be taxed more on their produce and that the subsidies they get from Europe should be reduced. I want to remind those people that the subsidies are not a gift. The farmers are entitled to them for producing food at a cheaper price and to compensate them for not being properly paid for the food, whether beef or dairy that they are producing. I resent the statement by that citizens' assembly a couple of weeks ago and I am glad to get the opportunity to condemn it for that because there was not a farmer in there that voted and passed that motion for the sham assembly they were all put into which was set up by this Government. There is only one assembly that I believe is correct and that is the people who are elected. Those people were elected by nobody. We are elected in here and we are the citizens' assembly.	spk_358
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-04-26	dail	33	Agricultural and Food Supply Chain Bill 2022: Report Stage	dbsect_37	I want to ask the Minister a direct question. Will he instigate an investigation into what has happened with fertiliser and the exorbitant cost of it? A cartel is operating. We have even been told the larger co-operatives have asked the suppliers that import fertiliser not to supply it or to hold up the supply to the smaller merchants, and that is very serious. It looks to everyone out there, down our neck of the woods anyway, as though the co-operatives are doing everything possible to keep the price of fertiliser up. If it were not for what happened in the North of Ireland, where it is available - we make no apologies for bringing it down - the cost of fertiliser would be still at the same level as last year. I am asking the Minister please to follow that up and instigate an investigation into what has happened. This is serious. It has driven up inflation and the price of everything. When farmers have to charge more, shops have to charge consumers more. It has directly impacted on the financial well-being of the country. Likewise, why is green diesel still being sold at a higher cost than it should be, given the prices of white diesel and petrol have dropped? The price of green diesel has not dropped at the same rate. Will the Minister follow up both issues? This is important. The whole country depends on food.	spk_364

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-04-18	dail	33	Finance Bill 2023: Report Stage	dbsect_11	First, in respect of the electric cars, and I have always said this, the general public are not fools and when the electric car is reliable, affordable and will be a realistic option, people will buy them. I have no doubt about that.Diesel and petrol cars are reliable and will take people the distance. It is about getting people from A to B, especially those in rural Ireland. They have longer journeys to make and depend on a reliable car. There is the question of if and when we will have infrastructure sufficient and adequate to provide the service people need. They need a fast way to charge cars and plenty of infrastructure to do so. That is not available at the moment and saying to people they will not be able to buy a diesel or petrol car after such a date - 2030 or whenever it is - is wrong. The Government should incentivise people by providing the infrastructure for electric cars. It must be able to reassure people they will have electricity at a certain time to run these electric cars because when the electricity goes out, everything goes out and the chargers will go out as well. The Minister has to take that into account and not be forced by the Greens into doing these things in a hurry, but to wait until people are sure the electric car is equal to the cars that are there at present and can bring people to Dublin from Castletownbere, Dingle or Valentia Island such that they will not be stopped two or three times along the way when coming up to see someone in hospital or for a serious appointment. An electric car is not an option for those people until radical changes are made. They might be fine for running around, bringing children to school, short journeys and city driving where the mileage is not big. They are probably an option for those people. That is fine. I have nothing against electric cars but we must also have electricity to ensure people are brought where they want to go.  I want to talk about the increases in diesel and petrol that the Government is bringing in on 1 June, 30 September and 31 October. I regret and resent them very much. Adding up what we are told the three increases will amount to, it is actually more than the reductions given at the time fuel went so dear, it forced the Government to reduce excise duty on it. I resent that it is being put up again, especially for the people who are out early in the morning in rural places and have no way of going to work without using a car. They are going on long journeys from rural places like Castlemaine, Gneevgullia, Scartaglin and Brosna. They cannot get into the centres of Tralee, Killarney, Listowel or wherever without a good, efficient car. People will always need cars in rural areas because public transport is not adequate to bring them everywhere they want to go. The Central Bank will not run a public transport system to cater for all the people in rural Kerry, not to mind the rest of the country.  Hauliers will be impacted by these raises. The cost of it is still exorbitant, along with carbon tax. Talking about carbon tax when a litre of petrol was €1.20 was bad enough, but putting on the increase as a percentage now is very unfair and wrong. When we talk about climate change and stopping people burning a few sods of turf on the fire, it galls me and many people to see rockets heading for the moon, Jupiter or wherever it is. When they lift out of the ground, there is a flame a mile long out of them, and we are made feel guilty about burning a few sods of turf on the fire, like we have done for generations. I can count going back to Tadhg na Rae in Kilgarvan. He is seven generations back from me and he was cutting turf at that time to keep his house warm. With all the impact we are supposed to have on the climate, at the same time there is no mention in the world of the environmental effect Putin is having on the atmosphere with the bombs he is shelling Ukraine with. Surely we must take everything in context when we are depriving our people of the opportunity to keep themselves warm and hurting them when they go to work by putting taxes on fuel to tax them out of it. It is very wrong and I feel very much for the people I represent in rural Kerry.	spk_248

Many people would need to know that something is going to happen, if we have a total electric system, that means they will still be paying excise in some form or other to make up the difference or the loss of the taxes the Government is getting already. People are very disappointed the Government is totally focused on electric cars. There are other ways of reducing emissions with the cars we have, such as liquid petroleum gas, LPG. In 1975 my father bought a demonstration model petrol car that was converted to gas. It was a wonderful car and did 500,000 miles. I am told they are very efficient and effective in reducing emissions. Also, biofuel can be added to diesel cars and will greatly reduce the emissions. This Government is giving no thought at all to other ideas and that is wrong. It is putting all our eggs in one basket. The other side of it is people could afford to do things like this. It would be way more practical and might arrive at the same goal the Government is striving for - not that I believe anyone on this earth can do anything about changing the weather, because there is some ulterior plan we have no control over.

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-04-18	dail	33	Department Underspend and Reduced Delivery of Affordable Housing: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about housing again this evening. We should be striving to give confidence to home owners. At the present time, they are frightened about the eviction ban and by all of the talk about eviction. I honestly feel that this is doing more harm and is ensuring that people will not rent out their houses. That is where we have gone wrong. There are so many vacant houses in good places but people just will not rent them out. There are two reasons for this. The first is that the tax they have to pay, at 52%, is too much. In Kilgarvan and places in that vicinity, one will only get €600 or €700 per month and if one has to pay half of that in tax, what has one got left? However, the biggest problem is that people are worried that they will not be able to get tenants out if they want their place back. They are afraid that they will not be able to get their place back and that is wrong. Even without the eviction ban, if a tenant goes through the legal process and does not want to leave the house, it takes four years before the householder can get the house back. That is if the tenant is paying. If the tenant is not paying the rent, it still takes 12 months. That is all wrong and it has to be looked at. The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, is too strict with the regulations and is not being fair. It is not even not helping the tenants either, when it comes down to it. The RTB is on the house owners' backs. People are afraid and are frightened away from renting. They would do anything now. They will sell their houses or will leave them idle. We cannot force them to rent out their houses because they are totally frightened away from it. All of this talk about extending the eviction ban, day in and day out, is totally wrong. If people build a house or buy a house and pay for it, it is their house and if they want it back, they should be able to get it back in a reasonable time and reasonable fashion. Most tenants and landlords get on fine. I do not like the word landlord but most of them get on fine. There are problems with a few and that is what has caused all of this hullabaloo. It is frightening so many house owners and stopping them from getting into the market.	spk_357
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-04-18	dail	33	Road Projects	dbsect_29	I am glad to get the time to raise this important issue with the Minister of State. This residential zoned land tax is having an adverse effect on farmers, especially dairy farmers, close to our towns in County Kerry, and I am sure it is happening all around the country. It is happening in places such as Killarney, Tralee, Listowel and Castleisland. Many of these farmers have not slept since they got notification at the beginning of April that they were liable for this zoned land tax. Some of these farms are classified as strategic reserve, which means that existing residential, infill residential and proposed residential - all those categories - should be dealt with first. Under strategic reserve you are not even entitled to get planning permission. You would have to do a material contravention and the council would have to agree to it before planning could be granted. There is plenty of other land. For example, in Killarney alone, Kerry County Council owns land in Deer Park and public land is owned by the HSE in St. Finan's Hospital, which it got from Kerry County Council in the first place. It should go back to Kerry County Council to build social housing on. We have been advocating for that for years. This residential zoned land tax was designed and brought in to deal with speculators and would-be developers in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other cities, but sadly there are plenty of other places to build in or around Killarney without doing this terrible deed to people and making them pay this tax. Some of them have been told it could be up to €100,000 a year. Even if their places were worth €1 million, they will not own them after a few short years. They will be totally wiped out with this tax. It reminds me of a song that goes:The rent and taxes were so high I could not them redeem And that's the cruel reason why I left old Skibbereen. Is the Government going to do that to these people who have given their lives to building up enterprises? Some of these have been farming for three generations. They supplied Killarney dairy before Kerry Co-op existed. Their places have been built up to be environmentally friendly. They are producing the best milk and beef that could be expected in any part of the world. Will these active farmers be wiped out? I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Departments of Finance and Housing, Local Government and Heritage where this is coming from. It is wrong.There are several things the Government should do if there is a shortage of houses, but it should not force anything on farmers who are actively farming. A distinction or exemption has to be made for these active farmers. I am glad to get the opportunity to raise this very serious matter. Some of these farmers have not slept. They have had tough times trying to survive in recent years, with Brexit and every other kind of problem that has hit them nationally. I appeal to the Minister of State.	spk_448
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-04-18	dail	33	Road Projects	dbsect_29	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have read all that he read out. Farmers have been notified by the local authorities that they are liable for the tax, even for land that is zoned as strategic residential in reserve. That is wrong. These are active farmers. It is recognised there is no demand for this development land around Killarney. There is no demand as such. In 20 years' time, if farmers have to wait that long, their land might still not be sold because we are waiting for a bypass. For some of these farmers, their only access is onto the national primary road, which is the N22 going to Killarney. We know the kind of traffic jams that are on that road. If there was to be a housing estate there, people could not get onto the road any evening because we do not even have the bypass. I say to the Minister of State these people are contemplating going to An Bord Pleanála. They have to go but it is an expensive process. I ask the Minister of State to ensure they are not put through this. Active farmers who have been farming their lands for many years should not be put through this. They should be exempt. A distinction should be made between them and the big hoarders of land in Dublin, where the housing problem is. We have an outland that is owned by the county council in Killarney at present to cater for the housing list, including land at St. Finan's and other lands the council has. There are other smaller pockets of land in the town of Killarney that could be built on. When all those places are built, in 20 years' time, the council can then come to these fellas by agreement, but it should not try to force them off their lands with this tax because that is what it and the Government are trying to do. I am sorry the Minister is not here to listen to me make the case. He is wrong in going down this road. He is hurting people. I was brought up to understand that you should never try to put one person or one community up by putting others down. That is very wrong. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that active farmers are exempted from this vacant land tax.	spk_450

Is the Government going to do that to these people who have given their lives to building up enterprises? Some of these have been farming for three generations. They supplied Killarney dairy before Kerry Co-op existed. Their places have been built up to be environmentally friendly. They are producing the best milk and beef that could be expected in any part of the world. Will these active farmers be wiped out? I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Departments of Finance and Housing, Local Government and Heritage where this is coming from. It is wrong.There are several things the Government should do if there is a shortage of houses, but it should not force anything on farmers who are actively farming. A distinction or exemption has to be made for these active farmers. I am glad to get the opportunity to raise this very serious matter. Some of these farmers have not slept. They have had tough times trying to survive in recent years, with Brexit and every other kind of problem that has hit them nationally. I appeal to the Minister of State.	spk_448
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-04-18	dail	33	Tax Code	dbsect_31	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have read all that he read out. Farmers have been notified by the local authorities that they are liable for the tax, even for land that is zoned as strategic residential in reserve. That is wrong. These are active farmers. It is recognised there is no demand for this development land around Killarney. There is no demand as such. In 20 years' time, if farmers have to wait that long, their land might still not be sold because we are waiting for a bypass. For some of these farmers, their only access is onto the national primary road, which is the N22 going to Killarney. We know the kind of traffic jams that are on that road. If there was to be a housing estate there, people could not get onto the road any evening because we do not even have the bypass. I say to the Minister of State these people are contemplating going to An Bord Pleanála. They have to go but it is an expensive process. I ask the Minister of State to ensure they are not put through this. Active farmers who have been farming their lands for many years should not be put through this. They should be exempt. A distinction should be made between them and the big hoarders of land in Dublin, where the housing problem is. We have an outland that is owned by the county council in Killarney at present to cater for the housing list, including land at St. Finan's and other lands the council has. There are other smaller pockets of land in the town of Killarney that could be built on. When all those places are built, in 20 years' time, the council can then come to these fellas by agreement, but it should not try to force them off their lands with this tax because that is what it and the Government are trying to do. I am sorry the Minister is not here to listen to me make the case. He is wrong in going down this road. He is hurting people. I was brought up to understand that you should never try to put one person or one community up by putting others down. That is very wrong. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that active farmers are exempted from this vacant land tax.	spk_450

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-03-29	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_7	I am glad to get the opportunity to speak. As the Taoiseach knows, I travel nearly every road in Kerry on a consistent basis. One of the roads I travel very often is the road from Kenmare, through Kilgarvan, down to Clonkeen then Flesk and into Killarney. Without going along the road, I can count in my head that there are 55 vacant houses from the top of the town in Kenmare down to the Kerry Way in the Curraglass townland. That is hardly going up or down any of the byroads off that - a short walking distance maybe. There is a certain amount of public transport on this road. Why are these houses vacant? Can we do anything? We must explore every avenue we can when we hear about the housing crisis and people ending up without a home. Surely we should be doing more to entice the owners of these houses into the rental market. We certainly know that the tax at 52% or 56% is keeping many of them out of that market.Owners in this area will not command large rents. They will only get €600 or €700 a month. After paying tax, they only have €300 to pay the bills. Confidence is gone in the private rental market and people are afraid that they will lose their houses and be unable to get them back when they want them. They have the right to get their houses back. Will the Government do something to relax the rules of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, which are too stringent and restrictive and prevent people from entering the market? Will the Government also do something for those who are without a home, cannot find a house to rent and are not on the housing list? We must help people who are on the housing list, but those who are not on it need a house as much as everyone else. They cannot afford to buy but are just above the threshold to join the housing list. Could we involve local authorities in renting houses? Perhaps they could succeed. People are afraid they will not get their houses back if they go private. The Government was able to offer €800 tax free to house owners who accommodated Ukrainians. Why can we not offer the same sum to accommodate our own people? Surely our own people are first and foremost. The Ukrainians are not to blame for the misfortune that has befallen them, but our people must be looked after. This is one of the areas I am asking the Government to explore.	spk_454
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-03-29	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_7	Regarding the €800, if the local authority rented the property from the house owner and the tenant was able to, he or she should pay according to his or her means and circumstances. I object in the strongest way to the Government's proposal that houses should be compulsorily purchased. Instead, the Government should talk to the owners and try to find out whether they would be interested or, if they had a problem, try to deal with it. The Government should certainly not go down the road of CPOs because it will turn every landowner and house owner against it. That is what owners were afraid was happening in the Dáil today. If they are banned from getting their houses back, it would be the same as an extension of going down the CPO route, which I do not want. There is much that we can do together, that being, to explore why these houses are vacant. There are vacant houses up all the other roads around Rathmore, Scartaglin, Gneeveguilla, Brosna and Knocknagoshel. There should be no one homeless. For people who came to this country fleeing the war, we were able to help them with transport and so on. The same could be organised as well.	spk_456

Schools like St. Oliver’s in Killarney, the Presentation in Killarney and St. Brendan’s Secondary School have had a massive increase in the number of pupils because of the influx of the Ukrainian fraternity. They need more facilities. Schools in places like Faha, Listry, Fossa, Teernaboul and Raheen have all done wonderful work. The teachers and all the people working in those schools have done wonderful work, but they need more facilities to cater for the massive influx. This is urgent. It is an emergency. I hope the application from Knocknagree National School is not one of the 58 because it has been on the list for a long time. There are other issues such as school transport. There is a difficulty with acquiring new buses. Contractors have asked that the 20-year rule be extended for two or three more years. If a bus is in good working order and passes the test, it should be allowed to continue in service. We need more SNAs. Early assessment for children with autism is vital. Parents are at their wits’ end trying to get early assessments and the current situation is not good enough. Another vital part of education that has developed are the crèches. The people working in them do not get paid when the school term finishes.They should be employed all year round like teachers.	spk_656

It is public money from people who are working hard and paying taxes. The Government would not be able to do it only for people like that who are out early in the morning and doing their best to try to keep their households going. The Government is doing this with their money instead of supplementing or helping them with electricity costs and the cost of fuel and oil. Instead, the Government is trying to stop people cutting turf to try to keep themselves warm and doing no harm in the world. At the same time, Germany is mining for coal and Russia is burning coal.I cannot understand how the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, can sit side-by-side with a man like this who is doing this with Irish money considering the state we are in. Anyone would think he had goldmines, diamonds or oil flowing into barrels. Instead of that, the Government is taking this money and paying for paper. It is being done to the communities that we are trying to represent. The state of them; they are perished with the cold.

I see that it is more hurtful to tenants who hope to be housed. I regret that Deputy Daly, from Kerry, chose to single me out for not voting for Sinn Féin's motion last week. This measure will only hurt the rental sector beyond repair. We have to be very careful not to do any further harm because a lot of harm has been done already. I am not programmed to come in here and do what someone else tells me. I am programmed by the people of Kerry who elected me, and those who have houses and are getting out of the market – full stop. From my door to a point 12 miles down the road, there are 45 houses vacant. Why did someone not do something or report on them, or why was someone not sent to ask the people concerned to enter the market? People are afraid they will not get their houses back, given all this talk in here. It is just one step behind a full CPO job. I was never for CPOs and am not now but I can see this is where we are going. They are doing it in the UK and Italy but I am not for that and never will be. We have to work by consensus. A person who owns a house has the right to do whatever he or she wants with it whenever he or she wants. I have to stand for fair play.	spk_296

A total of 68 houses, one pub and restaurant and a commercial business are affected by what is happening. I ask that additional funding be provided to remove and replace three non-performing wastewater treatment plants and connect to the live public sewer to take sewage to the treatment plant in Killarney. The pipe has already been brought north of the N22, which was a considerable task along a busy road from the Cleeney roundabout to the bottom of Madam's Hill north of the N22. The dangerous and tough work has been done efficiently and effectively at night by the contractors John McGillycuddy and John Donovan. The latter brought the sewage to his estate, which has been built since. All that needs to be done is to connect to that. Funding of €401,588 was provided on 21 September 2020. Much has changed since then and this funding is no longer adequate. I am asking for additional funding to ensure this work goes ahead. Kerry County Council has done great work. Tadhg Meehan, Paul Neary and Charlie O'Leary are very able men who have done their best to try to get this over the line. However, the route they were trying to take the pipe or thought it could be taken could not be obtained. They have to take it a longer way around, which will cost more. In 2020, things were much cheaper. The design was much cheaper. We do not know the exact figure but the cost will be almost twice the amount that was granted. I did not agree with a lot that the former Minister, John Gormley, did in his time. However, one good thing he insisted on and for which he brought a Bill through the Dáil was that estates would have to be taken in charge. These housing estates are typical examples. They were built more than 20 years ago. The residents are very worried because the council's environment section is out to them continuously due to serious pollution problems. The Minister of State can imagine where it is. It is on the top of Aghadoe, looking down on the lakes of Killarney. Anything that goes wrong has to go into the lakes. This request has been ongoing for many years. I raised it several times on Kerry County Council before I left in 2016. Councillor Maura Healy-Rae repeatedly tables motions on the issue. Everyone is doing their best, but Kerry County Council and I realise that we need a lot more money. I am asking the Minister to look at this.

The Minister of State wonders why the cost is going up. It is going up because the distance has increased. Instead of getting way leave from private property, which was not forthcoming, they had to go around the longer way. I can understand why people would not want a public sewer by the side of their houses. Surely the Government can understand that as well. It will cost more because of that and because building costs have increased in recent times with the cost of materials and labour.

I thank all the carers who do excellent work in County Kerry, especially the home carers. We talk about carers. When someone is caring for someone who needs a lot of care, they are actually living in their world for the 365 days and nights of every year. I know one particular man who raised a grand family and at the same time, saw after his sister. He is doing it today; he does it every day. He is on whatever payment he is on but he is only getting half-rate carer's allowance which is €180 per week for his efforts every year, throughout the years. The trouble then is respite. He is lucky to get one week of respite a year. He cannot go anywhere. He lives in his sister's world the whole time. What about the parents in their 80s who are caring for elderly children who are now in their 50s? These are people with physical and mental disabilities who cannot or will not ever be able to fend for themselves. Then we have a place like St. Mary of the Angels being closed down. As each patient dies, that bed is not being made available anymore. I had a situation a number of months ago where parents could not get their son into this place. Another lady could not get her daughter in and the option she was given was to take her daughter up to County Meath. That is the kind of system we have in this country.	spk_40

There is so much we could say about charges. I too have a gripe with parking charges in hospitals like University Hospital Kerry. We appreciate the exemptions that are available to some people when they are visiting a sick person on a daily or hourly basis but we need more such exemptions. I want to speak about medical card holders or rather, people who do not have medical cards. I have dealt with situations where a farmer gets hurt or gets sick and is in hospital. He realises that he does not have a medical card so he applies for a card then, knowing that he is going to be in hospital for a while because he has had a stroke, a heart attack or has a serious illness. When he applies for the medical card, in due course, invariably if he is entitled to it, he gets it. However, this could be six, seven or eight weeks after he applied and in the meantime, he has incurred significant costs. I have asked about this several times. In many instances with social welfare claims, the payment is backdated to the day that the person applies. I am asking that the medical card be granted from day the person applied. I admit that when someone gets sick like that, it is possible that he or she does not send in all that is required so that they can be granted the medical card but God almighty, when it is granted it should be backdated to the day it was applied for.	spk_296

It will have a significant economic impact and could potentially remove €236 million from the rural economy. It will also threaten food security and increase the cost of food. Farms will become unviable. A farmer who now has 58 cows has been told that when the register comes into place and the derogation is changed, he will have to reduce his stock to 42 cows. His operation will become unviable. Will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine deal with this? It is not fair.It is not right for farmers or for consumers.

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-03-21	dail	33	Finance Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_12	I am glad to have this opportunity. The cost of electricity is very punitive and is hurting many people, especially those in rural Ireland, because they have no options when it comes to electricity for heating and all the other appliances. They find themselves hit so hard. The Government has been asked several times to put a cap on this and it will not do it. I honestly believe now that the Government is satisfied with the way things are going because it is getting more tax out of it. The more profit and the more VAT collected by these companies and handed over to the Government in tax, the better it is doing, at the expense of people, especially elderly people, who really need electricity. Then the Green Party's leader, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, had the gall to try to stop people cutting turf. Those are the people who have a bit of heat, and I will stand by them for as long as I am elected here. I appreciate those people who do their best in the summer months to collect enough turf to tide them over until the winter. A lot of this winter was very cold and people who did not have a fire certainly would not want to be perishing with the cold. Fuel poverty is a big thing, and they are driven to it by the cost of everything, including the cost of heating oil. The big gripe I have is about green diesel. Green diesel, before the war, which has been blamed for everything, was 38 cent a litre. Then it went up at the same rate as white diesel, maybe, and was at approximately 90 cent per litre for a number of weeks. Then, all of a sudden, it was driven up to €1.40 a litre and it is still hovering around €1.20 a litre all the time. That has the effect of driving up the cost of agricultural produce because you cannot do anything on a farm without a tractor. The sooner the Government realises that when it drives up the farmer's costs, it drives up the cost of the food being put on the consumer's table or the housewife's table, the better. Then the Government says that it will claw back the increases on road diesel and petrol. That will hurt every man, woman and child working in rural Ireland, hitting rural Ireland more than any other place.	spk_168

The Government is not building enough quickly enough. It takes two years to do the paperwork for a housing scheme and it takes only a year to build the houses. That is long enough. There are no incentives for house owners. I am not calling them landlords because that is an old English word and we hated what the landlords did to people. There are no incentives for house owners to stay in the renting market. They are being taxed at 52%. What about people with vacant houses? There are 25 vacant houses very close to my door and the owners will not rent them out to anyone because they are afraid they will never again get them back with the way the laws are at the moment. If you pay for and own a house, it should be your fundamental right to do whatever you want with it, including if you want to sell it or want to do something else with it. Extending this ban will not increase housing supply by one unit or help anyone. It is only kicking the can down the road. To solve the crisis the Government must build more houses and increase supply. There are blockages in planning, sewerage systems and water supply. I will say one other thing. We have been attacked over the airwaves on Radio Kerry by Deputy Daly telling us what way to vote. When I want advice from Deputy Daly I will ask him for it, but I will see after the people in Kerry in my own way without his direction or-----	spk_278

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-03-08	dail	33	Protection of Cash as Legal Tender: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I thank Mairéad McGrath and Brian Ó Domhnaill for helping us to put this motion together. What we are essentially calling for is that the Government makes an order so there is a definite legal requirement on business and all entities to accept cash as a method of payment. Since Covid-19 we have sleepwalked into this situation where many places continue to demand cashless payments. In addition, the motion calls on the Government to lead by example and insist that it is a requirement that all public bodies accept or facilitate the acceptance of cash for payment of goods, services, taxes, levies, fees and charges. That part of our request is very important. The Government must make a definite order. Deputy Michael Collins mentioned restaurants. What about the young boys and girls working in restaurants on a part-time basis and maybe for the minimum wage? They always depend on getting tips. If payments are to be cashless, the client or the customer will pay with a card but they will not have cash in their pockets to give a tip to the young person who is working part-time and depends on tips. This is a very important aspect of it. The GAA now insists that tickets are booked online. I know of a very responsible gentleman who is a senior citizen and who gave his life to the GAA. At one of the last games in Killarney, he decided not to go because he was told he would have to book online and he did not want to impose on anyone. Yet when the GAA is fundraising, it can put a box on a stool or whatever outside the church gate and it has no problem with cash. That has to be reversed. The GAA is a respected part of our culture and our identity and is part of who we are and we depend on it to lead the way. The GAA cannot insist on cash only. I am asking the Government to make an order in that regard. What about old people who may not be able to travel themselves and when they want someone to bring them a product from the chemist or whatever, they give them cash? How will a card work in that situation? In many parts of rural Ireland, people do not have access to the Internet or computers? What will happen when there is a power outage? We have to think of these things. I am reliably told that when people go abroad they have to pay by card in most places. However, between the conversion rate and the extra charge for using the card, people do not know what is left in their accounts because the banks or the financial institutions do not update their accounts promptly and people are struggling at the end of their visit and do not have enough funds to continue. Those things are very important. There is no point agreeing with our motion; the Government must act. We are asking the Government to make an order that it is a legal requirement for everyone to accept by cash. It cannot be just some people. This includes Government offices and Departments which, in many instances, look for payment online or whatever and will send out the goods to people then. This is not fair on ordinary people. What about the people who do not have a bank account or credit facilities available to them? Those people cannot be disenfranchised.  I am appealing to the Minister of State in the strongest terms. We would have liked to have seen the Minister for Finance here but the Minister of State is a Minister too and we depend on him to take our message on board and ask for our request to be adhered to because this is very serious. We are going down the wrong road if we are going to allow a cashless situation to arise because it is just not fair on ordinary people.	spk_22

It is in the Lough Leane catchment. We all welcome this. Some €9 million is to be spent. The problem now is that Irish Water is deviating from what Kerry County Council, the local authority, always did. It is looking for €4,000 per household for connection. This was always placed at the roadside boundaries free of charge to entice people to connect. Work has begun. The road closure is in place until the end of September. The trench is open and it is 6 m and 7 m deep in places. It makes perfect sense to leave out the connections now as the work is progressing and that is what I am asking about.	spk_224

The Government has been found out. It is bringing in this emergency legislation to make sure the lights will not go out. The Government has been reckless since it took office. It closed Shannonbridge and Lanesborough, even though it had no alternative. There was plenty of turf available to keep those generating stations going. There are even 10,000 acres in Littleton in County Tipperary that is untouched. I was always brought up to know that wilful waste makes woeful want. That was the motto in our house, going back to my grandmother's time. At this time of crisis, when energy, gas, fuel and everything is so expensive, we should be using every means we can avail of in our country to ensure our people will not be suffering with the exorbitant costs they have been suffering since the Government took office. The Government is the cause of it. Since it closed down those places, the cost of electricity has gone up every day. What the Government has done is reckless. The Government has been talking about wind energy since I was elected to the House in 2016 and even before that. The Government has to realise that counties such as County Kerry have played their part. There are as many wind turbines as we can fit into the county. We have more than any other county in the country. We will not accept turbines beside our homes. I do not want a turbine put beside people where it is proposed to put them. The Planning Regulator shot down the County Kerry county development plan so that he can go ahead with wind turbines very close to houses. That is wrong. The Government is against Shannon LNG in north Kerry. Maybe we could get gas cheaper from the west, that is, from America or other places, but the Government is against that. The Taoiseach stopped the offshore licences for drilling for gas off the Kerry coast in 2019. The Government is against drilling for oil off the Cork coast, even though we have it. It wants us to stop cutting the bit of turf we always cut to put into the fire. I am cutting it and will continue to do so, as my people before me did, in the same bog, going back to 1800. We will continue to do so. My daughter Maura brings it home. Germany is mining for coal because it is seeing after its people. It is even taking out a village and putting it somewhere else to ensure it will have coal for its people. When our pockets are empty, we will go with a begging bowl to Germany for a loan or a bailout. China is building more coal-burning generation stations. It has up to 3,000 of them now. We are all under the one sky and whatever the Government does, it will not change the weather. We see what is happening in the USA. Americans have the largest of jeeps of 5.7 l and 7.7 l. They are all petrol. The USA is under the same sky as well. Our energy costs are skyrocketing and energy companies are boasting they are doubling, tripling and quadrupling their profits. The Government is benefiting as well because the more profits these companies make, the more tax the Government gets.

It is a serious issue for people. They are driven down through the ground with the costs of electricity. The Minister was blaming the war but we know that gas is cheaper now than it was before the war started. That is a fact, but the Government will not bring down the cost of electricity. It will not cap the cost, though it was asked to do so several times. There are different categories of people. Business people are paying three and four times what they were for electricity, people who were paying €70,000 and employing people, who are now paying €360,000. There are people who were paying €200 or €300 who are now paying €1,000 or €1,200. Old people are afraid to boil the kettle and barely light a fire. They light a small fire if they are lucky enough to have turf. The Government tried to stop us doing that. What is happening is so wrong. The Government did not make any attempt at capping the cost of electricity because it is getting more tax out of it, of course. Now that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is going so well in the Green Party, he is looking for an advisor for an advisor. Can you imagine that? I suppose he was limited with the amount of advisors he got, so he decided to get an advisor for an advisor. I can clearly see what is happening. The people in rural Ireland, people Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael got votes from, are disenchanted, very hurt and angry. The Greens are happy because they are getting everything they want and more. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael cave in to them just to keep themselves in power. Power must be something, to say that they are leaving them do what they are doing to the rural people, the good people who are trying to keep going, kept the country going back over the years and kept people employed. People were told to put in heat pumps. I know a young fella who built a new house a year and a half ago. His bills have now gone up to €1,250 a month for electricity because of the heat pump. It is nothing else, it is the heat pump. This is what the Government is telling people to put in and not to put a chimney in the house. God almighty, the Government had support in the countryside always and the people depended on it. They are gone from the Government now; it should realise that. The Greens will not suffer. They are doing fine. The Government must realise it is leaving people down and must act to do something about the cost of electricity. People can only go so far. You cannot get blood out of a turnip.	spk_230
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-03-07	dail	33	Disabilities Assessments	dbsect_31	I raise with the Minister of State the Kilcummin sewerage scheme where work is now under way to connect residents from Kilcummin to the existing Killarney scheme. I ask that the connection for residents and others be left adjacent to their properties, on the roadside at their boundary fence. This is not happening at present. I ask the Minister of State to provide a funding incentive to help with the connection fee. Residents are being asked to pay in excess of €3,900 for connection. The scheme is 3.7 km long and the project is to take sewerage from Kilcummin village down along the road to meet with the Killarney scheme and to treat it in the Killarney treatment plant. The cost is approximately €9 million. I had a long battle starting in 2004 to get the scheme going. It was to go ahead in 2008 but the contractor was disqualified and we had to start all over again. Then the country went bust and the economy went AWOL and that is where the scheme has remained since. Some 90 houses from Páirc Chuimín estate will be connected and 30 houses from Mountain View, as they had existing plants which will be connected to the scheme. Our Lady of Lourdes nursing home will also be connected, as it is at the start of the scheme. However, the residents of between 50 and 70 single houses along the road through Ballynamaunagh, Inchycullane and Coolcorcoran have been told they will have to pay €3,900 for a connection. On top of this, they will have to pay for the work to take the connection to their houses themselves. This is a new departure by Irish Water, as heretofore when all the other new schemes in Barraduff, Rathmore, Farranfore, Milltown and Ardfert in Kerry were progressed, the connections were taken from the main pipe and placed at the boundary wall free of charge adjacent to the residences. In Kilcummin, however, people must now pay a connection fee of €3,900. Irish Water says this has been approved by the regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to charge this sum. As this is a new departure in the provision of sewage facilities, will the Government make up the cost being charged by Irish Water for the residents' connections? This is a big mistake. The connections should be made now while the work is going on. The Kilcummin road is closed to facilitate the works. In places, the main pipe is down 6 m to 7 m. If the connections are not taken out at the mains now, it is unlikely to happen in the future. Will the Minister put the contractor in funds to make sure these connections are done now while the work is ongoing? The purpose of the scheme in the first place was to prevent pollution and protect the Deenagh river and the beautiful lakes of Killarney from algal bloom. The full benefit of the scheme, which is paid for with public money, will not be realised if all the residences along the road are not connected to the scheme. In all the previous schemes, when the local authority did the job, the connections were made to walls of people's properties so that all they had to do was take it from there to their homes.If it is not done now and it is left until a later date, there will be disruption and other complications.	spk_345

This is the first scheme that Irish Water has taken charge of and is responsible for in County Kerry. As I have said, up to now connections were left out on the side of the road for people, free of charge. While €4,000 may not sound like much to the Minister of State or to other people, if you do not have it, it is an awful lot of money. This is going to be a headline for all the other counties in which Irish Water will be responsible for sewerage schemes from now on. It says it will charge €4,000 per customer. I do not think that will work. It will not work in this case. It is a fright to God to spend €9 million of taxpayers' money and not ensure all the people along the road, who are adjacent to the road, are accommodated. There are between 50 and 70 houses that are not accommodated now. They were never ready for this. Most of them are conscious of pollution and water quality and want to be part of that. At this point in time, they do not have the funds to pay for it. Many of them visited my clinics in the last few days and highlighted what is going on. They said it is a fright that the pipe is passing them and the connections are not being left out while the work is ongoing. If people decide at a later stage that they will pay for it or whatever, it is going to cost Irish Water a lot more than €4,000 even to provide the connection as it will have to dig down 5 m or 6 m in some places, and maybe 2 m in most of it. That is never going to happen. What is the scheme for, if the big pipe is passing down the road and they are not connected to it? It does not make any sense in the world. It might be a small amount of money in the Government's eyes, but it is a big amount to the people involved. This is going to be replicated across the country. The Government either needs to talk to the regulator, which said it is all right for Irish Water to charge this money, or give Irish Water the funds to accommodate the connections.	spk_347

I want to praise ambulance drivers and paramedics in County Kerry for the great work they do. They are under increased pressure because, as we all know, doctors' surgeries are generally open from 9 a.m to 5 p.m. five days a week. There are 128 other hours in every week. People get sick during those hours, be it late at night, at weekends or whenever, and need to be seen to. SouthDoc is our out-of-hours service, which is under savage pressure.Places like Kenmare, which is central to many people in places like Lauragh, Sneem, Bonane and Kilgarvan, are often left without any doctor. For the people in Gneeveguilla and Rathmore, their out-of-hours service is in Millstreet, which is in another county. Doctors are under severe pressure. In Killarney alone, there are approximately 4,000 new people, who are refugees, etc., but there is not one extra doctor. For most patients, a quick medical response will determine their survival chances. For people who get a cardiac arrest or a stroke, minutes count. We need more out-of-hours doctor services because invariably it falls to the ambulances and the paramedics to deal with people in very rural areas in a limited amount of time. When they come to the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Kerry in Tralee, they have to wait to get their patients in.	spk_42

Credit unions facilitate those people who travel to get that necessary intervention or risk losing their sight or ability to walk. People must put the money upfront but they get it back and are able to give it back to the credit union. I especially thank the credit unions for playing ball with these people. The credit unions operate locally and know the people they are dealing with. We have bank managers who operate from Dublin and do not know the people on the ground who are looking for small amounts of money to stay afloat. I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill.

Until around 2011 or 2012, the ambulances were controlled locally but then a centralised service was brought in by the HSE which operated from counties Dublin and Donegal. There were two centres in total. Since then, the whole thing has gone wrong. Before I go any further, I want to thank all the ambulance drivers in County Kerry and our paramedics. Anything that is wrong with the ambulance service is not their fault. We have a number of ambulances in County Kerry. Let us consider what happened two weeks ago. The ambulance from Kenmare was deployed and sent to Clonakilty. It took a patient to Cork University Hospital and was sent from there to take someone to the hospital in Dungarvan. It then made a second run from Dungarvan to the hospital in Waterford. It was then delegated to go to Tipperary and finished up around Clonmel. After 13 hours' service, it was told to come back home to Kerry. In all that time, the whole district of Kenmare was left without an ambulance if something had happened. That is what is happening. The busiest urban centres are benefitting because when the ambulance leaves the Cork hospital after dropping the first patient, the paramedics have to press a button to say they are available for work. They can be sent to Midleton, Carrigtwohill, Kinsale or anywhere. The ambulances that leave Kenmare, Killarney or wherever it may be in County Kerry are gone for the whole time they are up in Cork.The Dublin centres are benefiting and it is the places in rural Ireland and places far away in Kerry that are left behind. Those people are struggling. That system must be reversed. I also want to speak today about our air ambulance. We must ensure it is properly funded. In the past four or five days, the air ambulance has been called to County Kerry for crashes and different things. We appreciate it very much.	spk_201

There is pressure on now and it has extended for a while, which is fine.However, we need to solve the problem. I welcome the Minister of State to his new position. I support People Before Profit's concerns, but we must do something permanent about them. I have been raising the matter for years in the House. The cost of rent is an issue, but we must realise that 52% of the rent is paid straight to the State. If the Government wanted to do something about the cost of rent, it would reduce the amount of tax it charged on a certain number of houses, particularly smaller ones, or whatever the case may be. Everyone who owns and rents out a house had to put work and money into it and is probably paying a mortgage. People need to have room to do that. House owners' rights need to be protected, too. I feel for the tenants. Getting rid of bedsits in a single blow was a desperate mistake, as they helped many people who just wanted a place to lie down for two, three or four years. It was a fine setup. The only people who can get planning permission in Kerry now are landowners' children. While I welcome that they can, no one else can in the countryside. There are 171 voids in Kerry. If the Government was serious about housing people, it would put those back into use. That cannot be done without Government funding.	spk_55

The most joyous occasion in the world has to be when a little baby is born to a mother, whether it is a boy or a girl. It is very sad to think this is what we are doing to those people who suffered in a darker time when people had different and wrong ideas. A child born to a girl or a woman in any circumstances has to be right. It is natural. Those girls and women were denied fair play, were sent to homes, were not let keep their children and were denied the mother and child bond which always happens when they are left together. No love that I know is greater than the love a mother has for her child. What happened to these girls in the past is very sad.  What the Government is trying to do with this Bill is mean. It denied many of the survivors the right to be heard by this commission, and to comment on the commission’s draft findings. The Government is now suggesting these survivors be limited to six months. I know someone who rang me today.	spk_368

I tried to contact the agency involved and I gave the timeline of when he was born and of when he was fostered out. He could clearly prove that it was at nine months. He was told, I believe by Tusla who represented the State, that perhaps it was only two months. I can see what the Government is at. It is trying to deny people redress. The Government, and there is nothing wrong about it, is looking after people from every other part of the world. I do not mind it doing that but please look after our own people. These people were badly looked after many years ago, and some were buried in slurry tanks around Galway. They were not looked after properly and that is where they were finished up. These were wonderful babies with all of their lives ahead of them. The Government is now trying to curtail them from getting redress as they enter old age. God damn it man, is the Government so mean in its heart? After suffering that kind of starvation, will the Government not now look after these people? What is wrong with it? The Government is denying these survivors the right to get proper redress and to be included in this Bill. What is the difference between seven months and four months in a mother and baby home ? Who decided that? What nitwit decided that was going to be a proper law? That will be contested in the courts and the Government will not have a leg to stand on.We are costing more money here arguing about this. I have been in the House at different times about this, as far back as 2016. Some of these people are in the Gallery today. They are still hurting and will always be hurting about what happened to them. There are more of them throughout the country. Some of them are on their last legs. What is wrong with the Government that it is denying our own people a redress scheme? Why is the Government trying to exclude them? I appeal to the Minister, at this late stage, to cop on, because what the Government is trying to do to these lovely people is not fair. I think of children being born into love and care and, at that time, it was frowned upon if a girl became pregnant outside of marriage. There was nothing wrong with it then and there is nothing wrong with it today. We are striving to ensure as many little babies are born as possible, that we see after them in hospitals or wherever they are to be seen after and ensure they get the medical care they need. These little misfortunates did not. Some of them survived and these survivors are around. We will exclude 40% of the survivors from the scheme and deny healthcare to two thirds of them who are still alive. Does the Minister honestly think that is fair or right? I have never been as upset about anything as this because it is totally ridiculous. The Government is absolutely mean-hearted. There is misery in its heart when I see it trying to bring forward the Bill in this form. I am asking the Government to change its mind. I am not blaming the Minister on his own, because there is a Government behind him. There are about 34 or 36 people in the Government. The Taoiseach called out the names of all the Ministers and there are that many of them involved that he gave nearly half an hour to naming them. I am appealing to them to cop on and ensure these survivors are properly looked after and that all of them qualify for the redress scheme.	spk_381

However, I must say that in the past number of hours, I have got a woeful lot of criticism from working-class people; those in the middle who are paying for all of this. As recently as ten minutes ago, a man was on to me about his ESB bill. He is a working person. His wife also has to work. They have big bills and a young family. He was pointing out that his bill has gone from €270 to €890. It has more than tripled. Working-class people are in a desperate way. Many people think and feel that ESB prices should have been capped and that we should have started there. While the Government is giving back money to some people, there are other people and businesses paying extraordinarily high bills for electricity. It is hurting many people. Some businesses have already closed and more will close. That has to be addressed, especially when these energy companies are making so much profit. The Government is also receiving more tax out of that situation. Lorry, bus and car drivers are on the road because they have to go to work. They are paying enormous amounts for diesel and petrol, above and beyond what they used to pay and what they are able to pay. Their wages have not gone up in line with those increases in the cost of living for everyone.	spk_474
Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-02-22	dail	33	Financial Resolution No.3: Value-Added Tax	dbsect_43	I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the important issues of excise duty, VAT and the significant cost of fuel for people on the road. The Minister stated that excise duty and VAT rates would be increased in, I believe, June and September. I appeal to him not to restore the rates of excise duty and VAT unless the cost of fuel imports reduces to what it was in January 2022 before the war. People will not be able to afford it. There are those who cannot manage without a car or other form of transport. They have to use a vehicle, be it powered by diesel or petrol, to get to work. I was over in New York and New Jersey a week ago at my uncle's funeral. There was no diesel vehicle to be seen anywhere, only the largest of V8 petrol Jeeps and cars. There was not a single word said about carbon or the like. We are all under the one sky – the same moon and sun shine over there, albeit at different times of the day and night, given the time difference.People in Ireland may not travel to America but they know what is going on there. We need to be fair about it and Irish people always play their part but they are being vilified and demonised in a desperate way. They should not be. Our people are as good as any people in any part of the world but they are not being treated as such. There is a green tail wagging the dog and they are giving people an awful lot of grief. In Germany there is no problem in the world and they are opening up coal mines again. They are even moving a village to open a coal mine. Yet, there is a Minister here who says we cannot burn turf or sell a bag of turf or we cannot sell it online or whatever rubbish he is on about. It does not make any sense in the world. Then, other people are freezing with the cold because they cannot purchase oil or coal due to the cost of it. Single people who may be just on a pension cannot live with the carbon tax and the increase in fuel. The basic thing I wish to tackle is the cost of green diesel. White diesel went up to €2 and €2.20, but if we go back before the war, green diesel was 38 cent per litre and white diesel was about €1.20 per litre. Both started to rise and then at one particular time - I do not have the date - green diesel was 90 cent per litre and white diesel was around €1.90 per litre. All of a sudden, green diesel went up in one week to €1.40 per litre, then to €1.45 per litre, and it reached €1.50 per litre. Today, it is €1.21 per litre. I want to know what is happening with green diesel. I called for an investigation into fertiliser yesterday. I want an investigation and answer on this for the people using green diesel. It is not right. Something is wrong. Extra money is being charged. It is basically farmers who use green diesel. As I understand, it all comes in as white diesel but somewhere along the line Revenue gets at it and puts green dye into it, which is how it is marked gas oil at a lesser price. It is almost on par with white diesel now. I want an answer to that. I will be asking the Minister about it again. It is important and means an awful lot to many people. It is very hurtful and it is the difference between keeping going and not keeping going. Something happened somewhere along the line. It did not go up at the same rate as white diesel or petrol. It went up double or treble. It is now €1.20 per litre but before these increases started, it was 38 cent per litre. White diesel was €1.20 per litre, but now it is €1.70. There is a massive difference which must be examined and explored. We need to be told what happened or how it happened and given an explanation for why it is so exorbitantly dear today. I am interested in that issue.	spk_512

This is the second year that Irish farmers will have to pay unrealistic, exorbitant, over-the-top prices for fertilisers. In recent weeks Germany, other European countries and the UK are paying 40% less than our farmers for fertilisers. They pay €500 a tonne for urea while Irish farmers are paying €850 to €900. I thought when we went into the European Common Market in 1973 that all EU countries would have a level playing field especially with prices for goods and supplies. It has become very clear that we do not have enough competition in the fertiliser market. This problem began in October and November 2021, months before the Ukraine war. Prices began to soar and after Christmas but still before the war, prices increased further. Some of the co-ops would not even quote farmers. Last March, Kerry farmers could not get fertiliser for almost two weeks as it was being held up by the distributors and co-ops so that they could increase the price further. It is absolutely ridiculous that many co-ops will not quote farmers today for the price per tonne for fertiliser. They will provide it to the farmers and send the bill later. It is very clear that the fertiliser distributors and suppliers are profiteering at the expense of our farmers. The profits of Yara, one of the fertiliser suppliers, increased by 60% between September and December last year. Mosaic, one of the leading producers, doubled its profits in the same period. The whole thing is rotten with farmers suffering and households crippled with increased food costs. Before the increases, urea started out at €380 a tonne in 2021. Last year it was €1,000 a tonne and it is still €900 a tonne now.The fertiliser companies blame the war and claim that the increased cost of gas is the reason for the increase in production costs. There has been a constant reduction in the price of natural gas – up to 85% - since last September. We should be seeing a major reduction in the cost of fertiliser. It is becoming clear that we do not have proper competition in the fertiliser market, with Goulding, IFI, Grassland and Yara operating together. I am calling for a high-powered investigation at national and European levels into what is happening. What is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, for? Is it a charade? Is it being paid for nothing? It is not helping Irish farmers or Irish consumers in how it is letting this situation go unattended.	spk_32

Will he agree to hold a high-level investigation into what is happening? That is what I am asking him for. This issue is serious and is hurting farmers all over the country, including in Kerry of course and most importantly. It is also hurting consumers, though. The farmers are not Mother Teresas. If they have to pay an exorbitant cost for fertiliser, it will have to be added to the rest of their costs and the poor people who pay to put food on the table will suffer. Will the Government hold an investigation at a national level and a European level? The Government is back and forth to Europe every day and is doing this and that for it. Now is the Government's time to ask Europe to do something for Irish farmers. They cannot suffer these increased costs. Why is it that we are paying €850 or €900 per tonne for urea when Germany and other countries in the EU and across the water in the UK are only paying €500 per tonne? The Taoiseach has to suss them out and see what is happening.	spk_34

I am opposed to the setting up of a citizens' assembly, because we are the elected people in here to represent the people out there. Hand-picking a group of people, as the Government did in previous citizens' assemblies, is not fair. When one thinks about it, one of those assemblies which was very important did not include any representatives from 11 counties, County Kerry being one of them. I am afraid of the Government setting up an assembly here, where there is no representative from a place as expansive as County Kerry, which has a drug problem. I am greatly worried that this is an orchestrated move to legalise drugs, instead of criminalising them. The story is bad enough as it is. They are in every small town and village in our county. Instead of the Government doing something to help the people who have a problem and who develop mental health issues, we see the hames that is being made of the mental health issues in County Kerry with south Kerry and north Kerry child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and all over Tipperary and every other place. There is no proper psychologist or psychiatrist to deal with the young people who are developing problems. It is no wonder they resort to drugs to find out something different. This is totally and absolutely wrong. In France, a citizens' assembly was set up and, before it went halfway in its deliberations, they all walked out of it. It was the same with the Brexit citizens' assembly which was widely criticised for not being representative of the population. Again I say, we are the elected Members in here. We have been elected by the people. If we do not do our job, we will be found out and told that at the next election, when we go before the people on our record. These people the Government will appoint here inside can walk into anonymity the minute the citizens' assembly is finished. They will probably come up with some idea and the citizens' assembly will be held accountable, regardless of what it comes forward with. That is what the Government will follow then. It is only a cop-out by the Government. The Government is made up of the people who are elected. Deputy Naughton is a Minister of State and she and the other Ministers have a duty to respond to the issues that are arising out there. Drugs are a big problem, but to leave it up to a citizens' assembly is totally and absolutely wrong. It is too costly and will not be properly representative of the people who are affected. I am calling on the Government to forget about it and deal with the issue itself, if it is Government enough to do that. If it is not, it should pull out and leave it to someone else.	spk_180

If all of us who have been talking about housing in here for the last seven or eight years put one block on top of the other every day since we started talking we would have a building built that was taller than the Empire State Building in New York. That is the gospel truth. There are a few things I have raised several times before. We have 171 voids in Kerry. The Government should start there and give us money to put those back in use again. Levies and service charges are depriving many people of the chance to build their own houses. Water connections, water and sewerage services and all that are too expensive. They are between a third and half the cost of the house. Getting rid of bedsits was a wrong move, as many people started out in those. I have said that several times. Planning permission in Kerry is now only for landowners' sons and daughters. While I appreciate that, there are a lot of other young boys and girls who would build a house for themselves if they could get planning permission somewhere in a corner in rural Ireland. There are plenty of corners and plenty of places but the rules are such now that they will not get planning permissions. Members combined in here and voted to get rid of Airbnbs. You can be there from June to January and these will not turn into long-term lets. The big problem is landlords are getting out because of two things, namely, they have to pay 52% tax on what they get and if something goes wrong, they cannot get tenants out. They do not own their own house any more and that is the gospel truth. Harm is being done by extending things to allow tenants stay on.	spk_249

These roads are used by households, farmers and service providers, including doctors and nurses. These people pay their motor tax, property tax, income tax, VAT and excise the same as people in Dublin. Counties with fewer applications are getting more when we in Kerry have a Minister - the Minister for Education - from the county. The people of Kerry are entitled to the same quality of roads as the people in Dublin 4. They even provide their own water supply and septic tanks. The people of Kerry are being denied fair play.

I thank the Minister for bringing forward this legislation at this time. The memorandum circulated to Members states that the purpose of the Bill is to modernise the existing legislation relating to civil defence matters contained within the Air-Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946, and the Civil Defence Act 2012. Civil Defence provides five core services, including emergency response, search and rescue, medical response, community assistance and a radiation monitoring service. It is very important that at this time, its role is updated and it is properly recognised. The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate existing disparate legislation in place in this area. Each one of us, particularly elected Members, knows how vital Civil Defence is. There are times when Civil Defence is very visible such as during normal big events with crowds of people such as the day of the Munster final in Killarney when we have a go at Cork, treat it very well and hope it does not win. Civil Defence is very visible on days like that. Its members are at major events like the Rose of Tralee and the horse racing in Killarney but it is equally visible on desperate days when someone is missing and a family is trouble. Civil Defence plays a vital role. Civil Defence members are volunteers but they are trained. I set out the various roles they can play. When somebody has a cardiac arrest, they are probably the nearest at times to help when help is needed. Civil Defence plays a vital role with the diminishing presence of An Garda Síochána or when its members are away on different operations. They provide as good a service as those who are paid to provide them and they must be recognised and properly treated and have the proper equipment. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the Civil Defence has that.  I also thank all the other volunteer services in Kerry such as the Order of Malta, the Red Cross and the air ambulance, which is vital. We know the vital role it has played in saving so many people by taking them directly to the larger hospitals where they get treatment. We know how great that service is. It goes into areas that are so slow to get in and out of and does miraculous work and we really appreciate it.We previously raised in the House the issue regarding the air ambulance service and I am proud to be a member of the Rural Independent Group, which did so. Those people need proper financial assistance to keep that service going. Without that, rural places including in County Kerry, such as Glencar, Scartaglin and Brosna, will be impacted. Kerry is a massive county and that has to be recognised. Perhaps in Dublin, the services are more visible and readily available, but people living in rural Ireland and rural Kerry need the same services as the people everywhere else and in the urban areas. I appreciate the Tánaiste's efforts in this regard and will thank him if he takes stock of what we are asking for such that these people will be properly funded.	spk_190

Things are very bad as it is, and it is hard enough for people to survive and to make ends meet. The other problem is how to entice the young generation to follow in their footsteps. With what is going on now, there is no effort being made to help these farmers. We should be talking about the price of fertiliser, and what it is costing people. It is evident that the purpose of this register is not for fun. This is Green policy. The Minister is saying that the Government is not bringing in any programme to make farmers reduce their herds, but it is doing it in another way. It is evident that in any year the Minister will restrict farmers to so much fertiliser. The Minister has not told us yet what that limit will be but this register is not for the fun of it. The Minister will tell them, and that will be the next legislation or the next part of his programme. The Minister will tell them what they will only be allowed to spread. In any year - I am a farmer too - grass growth is different. Some years one would have to put out way less fertiliser and in others one would have to put out way more because it does not work fast, it is slow to work or in the heat it will not work.There are so many differences. At the time that farmers want grass to grow, it will not grow without fertiliser and the fertiliser often does not work. Farmers will have to reduce their stock. There is no concern in the Government about food security. In California, we hear it costs $1 for one egg and $12 for a dozen eggs. It will not be long before that happens here because people have to reduce the number of hens they have and need a herd number to have hens. We have all of this carry-on. The Government is leaving the people behind. As well as voting for the Healy-Raes, which we are very proud of, people in rural Ireland have voted for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and they still do, but they are being let down at the behest of the Green Party. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will pay a high price for the positions they secured by getting the Green Party to back them. The Green Party is getting everything it wanted at the expense of the people in rural Ireland. A great man, Terence O'Shea, who supplies veterinary products at Kenmare Mart will be gone with the passing of this Bill. Vets did not look for this; they have plenty to do without having more red tape and responsibility imposed on them. It will cause problems for farmers by making it harder for them to access the doses and drenches they need. They were able to do two things at the one time at the mart but now the Government is going to close down Terence O'Shea's business and other businesses. Instead of talking about the cost of fertiliser or trying to help farmers, the Government is trying to paralyse them further and drive them down into the ground, more so than has been done already.	spk_221

People in every walk of life are suffering from the increased cost of living in our country, especially less well-off people who are suffering more and are less able to cope with these increased costs. The increased cost of gas and oil has driven up everything else. If we did what other countries did at the very beginning by capping the cost of electricity and curtailing the amount of VAT on gas, carbon tax and excise that the Government took, the thing could have been controlled much better and the cost of living would have remained basically the same as it had been. It would have made life much easier for everyone.The cost of electricity has tripled, the electricity companies are making triple the profits out of it and the Government is taking increased tax out of it. Yet, as we know today, the cost of making electricity has reduced considerably. We have oil off the Cork coast and gas off the Kerry coast and the Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal could import gas more cheaply from western sources. The Government does not want to entertain that because of its green policies. Sadly, there is the VAT on the hospitality sector. If the Government increases that, who will pay for it only the consumer? It will hurt the tourism sector. The Government must keep that VAT rate at 9%. The Government has missed its opportunities.	spk_290

Banks, of course, never lose. When they did, the Government bailed them out with taxpayers' money. When people put their money into the banks, they get very little interest for it. In fact, if they leave it there long enough, it depreciates in value. People with mortgages are suffering. I am adding to the pleas for an interest relief scheme to help those people. The Government could help more with the costs of electricity and running a car. It should do something about the cost of electricity but it is not. If a young couple or anyone else is building a house, more than one third of the cost goes into levies, services and VAT on materials. The banks make it very hard for couples to get mortgages in the first place, yet, the Government has shares in the bank. How is it the Government cannot talk to the banks and help the people it represents? I will tell the story of a young man, Tim Brosnan, who built his house about a year and a half ago. He built it as per regulations and had to put in an air-to-water system. He is on to me every day about the cost of electricity. He is paying €1,200-odd in each bill to cover the cost of his heat pump. It is absolutely ridiculous. He says he has no bother coping with the mortgage but this cost is beating him. He goes out in the dark, comes home in the dark and still cannot make it work. It is easy for him to tell that solid fuel, whether it is oil, turf or timber, is still the cheaper and better option for the people who are suffering. I ask the Government to do something to help people because these regulations are crippling them.	spk_288

Levies are always a contention. There are different aspects of levies but they are contentious for people who do not see the benefits of the levies after paying them. We all know now that levies, service charges and connection fees make up almost half the cost of building a house. This is stopping young fellas from building their own houses. It is costing €140,000 to €150,000 between levies, connection fees, VAT and you name it. This is stopping people. It is stopping small developers. Connection fees from Irish Water are exorbitant and it is costly for developers to put in a sewerage connection and water connections for a small number of houses. I have to talk about places like Scartaglin. It has no treatment plant. Myself and Tom Fleming were councillors at the time and we had Scartaglin up to number three on a list for a programme to be done and there it is still with no treatment plant. Likewise, Currow has no treatment plant. Those communities cannot develop or grow. Then there is Castleisland. I found documents belonging to my late father fighting for an extension to the sewer in Castleisland going back to 1986. Can the Minister of State imagine that? They were at it even before that. That is almost 40 years. Then there are ridiculous things happening, like in Killarney where there is serviced land but it will not be built on because it is not in the current zoning. There is also a scenario where a local farmer who never asked for his land to be zoned has had it zoned and he wants to continue farming. There are things like that. There is a lot of talk about housing up here in Dublin and I do not mind people doing that but we have to fight our own corner. There are 171 vacant houses in the county of Kerry, going back two, three or even four years. If the Government is serious about building houses or providing houses for people, there are 33 houses vacant in Killarney. There are three houses vacant in Gneeveguilla, right around the circuit, and the Government is talking about building houses.	spk_37

It appears the Government is deliberately blocking the public from having any voice when it comes to the Government's immigration policy, which is all over the place. This is clearly being dictated to us by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels and we cannot have a debate in here because we are held back from doing so. I too want to talk about the energy policy we have. We shut down Bord na Móna in the middle of the country when we had no alternative and we have no alternative. We see that Germany, which seems to have common sense all the time about most things, is opening up its coalmines to ensure its people are warm and secure in their homes. It is doing something for its people but this Government is doing nothing only trying to ensure the people will perish with the cold. We had the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, out in the summer telling us we should not be cutting turf but I am glad that where I come from they are burning turf and they have turf to burn. I hope they will be allowed to have it for a long time because there is no alternative coming from the Government. The Government is not helping the people but it is trying to ensure that everything wrong is being done to them by stopping them cutting a bit of turf that never did any harm to anyone. When I see the smoke coming out of Dan Kelleher's chimney at 7 a.m., I am glad that he has a fire to keep himself warm because the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, would not keep him warm.	spk_163

Many young children have been damaged by the lack of proper care from CAMHS. The HSE blamed a junior doctor in south Kerry, but what is the cause of the problem in north Kerry? It seems that there is a problem all over the country. It is very clear that when these boys and girls needed attention and help, it was not there for them. I do not think it is there at present either. I am very disappointed about that because families were and are upset that their children will never be the same again. Antipsychotic drugs were pumped into them regardless of the problem they manifested, and no time was given to them. What happened was criminal. If it was any other place, I am sure the Garda would be called in to investigate what was going on. The HSE is not at the races when it comes to dealing with young children. Why is it the case that the most of those who are waiting for attention are in Kerry and Cork and not in Dublin or elsewhere?	spk_210

Danny HealyRae	70	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2023-01-25	dail	33	Inshore Fishing: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	I thank the Minister for recognising that we were the only group that tabled a motion representing inshore fishers. They have been left behind in many ways. The Minister spoke for ten minutes, but he did not say whether he would accede to our request for €12 million for inshore fishers in our coastal communities. They are on their knees. The situation has been spelled out for the Minister. For example, the season for shrimp fishing is September to March. Since September, the situation worsened badly because there was no market in Spain, Portugal and other tourist destinations. The price was bad and there was no market in the end. Since mid-October, there has been storm after storm and wind after wind, and many fishers have either been unable to fish or have only been able to fish poorly. Their window of opportunity was short. They ceased fishing from 1 December because there was no market. We are asking the Government for €12 million to tide them over and try to keep them going. Every other sector, including in other countries, is being looked after well by their respective governments, but our fishers are being left behind. They are an integral part of coastal communities. If they do not make a few bob, shops, local pubs and local restaurants will also be left behind. We have to accept that our inshore fishers are affected by the major increase in the cost of fuel and that they cannot get VAT back. The Government will blame the war for the fuel costs and the loss of the market, but we are calling on the State for financial assistance of €12 million to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of the crisis. Smaller piers are being neglected. I can think of those that are local to me, starting on the Kenmare side and going all the way along to Templenoe, Blackwater, Tahilla, Rossdohan, Oysterbed, Sneem, Gleesk and so forth. On the other side are the piers at Coornagillagh, Kilmakilloge, Lauragh and Castletownbere. There are many small fishers in those areas who are trying to improvise and keep going. They are getting no social welfare payments and are working by doing small bits of farming or building. Fishing was an integral part of their incomes, but it is lost to them completely now. The Minister says he comes from a place much like the ones we represent. These people have boats of less than 12 m in length at between 16 ft and 18 ft. I think of people like Mr. Frank Riney, Mr. Michael Clamper, Joe Jim at Blackwater and the O'Sheas of Rossdohan. There are two sets of O'Sheas there – Mike and Donal. There are also the O'Briens in Sneem. These people try hard. Their work is dangerous. I used to work on the roads along the bay and I often asked why they were out on bad days when the wind was blowing and the rain was down. I was told those were the best days to get more fish. Large trawlers come up the bay in Kenmare. The Government says it is involved in the protection of smaller vessels, but what is it doing when two large trawlers sail up either side of the bay with nets across it to clean everything out? I raised this matter at the Oireachtas committee a few months ago. What will the Government do to stop this from happening? It is unfair. These trawlers are taking everything, which means we have had no mackerel. Many people have told me there has been no mackerel this year. I remember fishers from Macroom, Innishannon and so on calling to the bar with buckets of mackerel. They would throw out a few and they were grand, but there has been no sign of them in recent years because there has been no mackerel. The bay is being cleaned out. We hear about large factory ships landing at Dingle Harbour. They are so large that 12 forklifts can work on them at the same time. We are told they are from different countries, so there is no accountability and they cannot be taxed. We are even told of Chinese factory ships, and we know what harm the Chinese are doing beyond factory ships. Fishers at Cahersiveen and other piers are being impacted. I call on the Government. Please, it is looking after every other section of the community, including other nationalities, well, but we are leaving these people behind. We have to look after them. They are an integral part of our coastal communities. They are important to the likes of the Lake House, the Blackwater Tavern and Helen's Pub in Kilmakilloge, which is run so well by Ms Helen Moriarty and her staff. These people and local shops depend on fishers surviving. I respectfully appeal to the Government to come down when its members are asked to. The Minister says he is from a coastal community, and he is. He must look after coastal communities – his own people – no matter what the Green Party or anyone else says. This is his time. He is the Minister in charge of these small fishers. I respectfully appeal to him to look after them. This is an important issue. We are the only group to table a motion like this one. I must highlight the state of the two roads on either side of Kenmare Bay. The road to Lauragh is crisscrossed by trees, which fish lorries are hitting.West of Blackwater Bridge, the other road is a state. If an articulated truck went around a car, the car would be under it. Then a few miles back the road we can see where 2 km of a footpath and cycleway was put in but there is no cycleway leading to this new cycle path or out of it. It makes no sense in the world. People lose their lives there and there are crashes there every day. It is so important that we have a safe road for these vehicles. I am glad when I see these big lorries going up to the village carrying fish. It is because we are producing something. In the few seconds I have left, I want to thank Star Seafoods and the McCarthys for the employment it has provided over the years. There is a new generation there now and the company is looking out for the local people and trying to employ people. The cost of fish and the scarcity of it at the present time is impacting on that. We must ensure that places like that are kept going. We have been hit badly enough as it is, but if we lose the people who are involved in working in inshore fishing, our communities will be completely doomed.	spk_36

We must do our best to retain the post offices we have left because they are vital to local communities. Elderly people go to the post office for their pensions and social welfare payments. I ask the Minister of State, as I have asked previously, to give more work to the post offices. It is not money they want; it is work. We have asked previously about banking services that could be operated through the post office network, a form of community banking where the profits would go back into communities.

We all know that organ donation is so important. It can make a difference and ensure that someone's life is saved. It can save the lives of people who are suffering from organ failure, be it a heart transplant, a lung transplant or a kidney transplant. We must recognise also where a family member gives one of their kidneys to ensure another family member can stay alive and have a normal healthy life. Transplants can reduce waiting lists in hospitals and decrease the number of deaths, so it is very important as we are helping others. This Bill should increase awareness to ensure we get more donors. It is very important, however, to note that the Bill includes what the Minister for Health describes as a ""soft"" element. The next-of-kin of the deceased person will continue to be consulted and have a veto on any proposed transplant. If the next-of-kin objects to the donation, the donation will not then proceed. This is very important. It is a very traumatic time for someone when a family member passes away, be they young or old. It is so traumatic. Death never comes at the right time for anyone. For the family left behind it is very important to do what they feel the person who has died would have wanted. That is usually what happens and we must ensure this continues to happen. People are being told to indicate their wishes for after death. The new law creates a sort of soft opt-out regime for organ donation. The Bill aims to create a presumption that individuals are donors unless they have opted out of the scheme. The family still has a veto, however, if they feel there is something wrong or that it should not proceed. They will have the veto on the donation going ahead. I, too, recognise the great work being done by the undertakers under extreme pressure. All of the undertakers in Kerry have certainly been under pressure for the past two months given the number of people who have died. I must recognise the work done by Quills in Kilgarvan for 70 or 80 years. It is operated now by John Quill. This man is way up in his 90s and still goes behind his shop counter every morning, and is in charge of the funerals with his son Danny. They do great work, as do the undertakers in Kenmare, Killarney, Rathmore and Gneevgullia and Firies, and all the other places. They are great people. They are very professional people. We must recognise that since the death grant was abolished they often bury people without getting a penny. I am very sad this grant has been abolished because it meant so much to families that did not have the funds to bury their next-of-kin, or if there was no one else after the dead had passed. As a result of the undertakers we have, no one has gone unburied in Kerry. They undertake to carry out the service the very same as if they had been paid or would be paid. The Minister must recognise that the Government denied the grant. We all know at this stage who did it: the crowd that were in power from 2011 to 2016."	spk_368

I blame Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for taking the Green Party on board and doing this to the people of Ireland. It is all right for them to say they know nothing about it. We know the Minister of State knew about this as far back as March 2021. She knew about Coillte plans to use such a private vehicle to acquire lands. That is why the Government is not granting licences for anything and confidence in the forestry sector is lower than it ever was before. The Minister presided over the fishing debacle that will wipe out coastal communities and now confidence in farming is going out the window because farmers are being told they must buy more land to have the same amount of stock. How can they buy it now that they are competing with London? The Government is handing profits, money and land over to London after people fighting for 800 years to own land here. What has the Government done? It has let them in again, helped them with state aid and EU grants and told them to come back over to Ireland. Farmers will not be able to increase their holdings. I remember the poor Coillte workers coming to work at 8 o'clock in the morning. I was there with them and I saw that when they were five minutes late they had to stand back until 9 o'clock. They worked hard and put Coillte in the picture. They did a pile of work but the Government has ensured that confidence in forestry is at its lowest ebb. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae stated, you would have to go back 60 or 70 years to find Ministers worse than those we have now. This is shameful. The Ministers are saying they did not know about it. Just like the finance Ministers knew about the plan to makes banks cashless in the summer, the agriculture and forestry Ministers knew about this deal They cannot deny that. They were involved in it and they did not care about granting of licences to anyone in any part of forestry.	spk_460

To that end, I want to make him aware that up to 40% of hotel and guest house accommodation, 2,404 rooms I believe, or more, are taken up with refugees and asylum seekers. Some 400 men, asylum seekers, have been in one centre in Killarney since 12 October. I ask the Tánaiste two separate questions. First, what alternative accommodation will he provide for the 4,500 Ukrainian refugees in Kerry and Killarney? What alternative accommodation will he provide for these, many of whom have children who are now in schools and in the middle of the school year? Second, the 400 asylum seekers in Hotel Killarney who I believe are all men, should be removed from Killarney. They should never have been placed there in the first place, all together in one hotel on one side of town. These come from at least 12 different nationalities. Since they came there on 12 October last, there have been many reported incidents of friction between themselves on a daily basis with Garda vehicles outside the place day after day, culminating on new year's night at 8 o'clock with five people being stabbed and one fellow's finger being cut off. Five ambulances were outside the place and at least that many Garda cars were on the Park Road which is the main access to Killarney town. The placing of 400 asylum seekers on Park Road has caused a deterrent to many women, girls and even young boys locally who are afraid to walk the footpaths for leisure or necessity as they feel intimidated by large groups of asylum seekers. Ye landed these people and did not provide one extra doctor or any extra social welfare worker to the welfare staff. What vetting takes place with these asylum seekers when they come to this country? The people of Killarney and Kerry want to know. People are coming here without any documents. Surely they could provide documents after a few weeks or whenever. Are they just left to their own devices after they come in and they say they have no documents? I ask also about asylum seekers from Georgia and Algeria. Are they entitled to come here?

It is fine to say there is a legal obligation to the people outside but if the thing is not being done properly, and if the Government is compromising our own operators here in Kerry in this instance, it is not fair and it is not fair on those people.

When we talk about health in Kerry, we know people suffer immensely when trying to get into University Hospital Kerry. There are waiting times and people are waiting on trolleys. Ambulances are arriving and the staff cannot take in the patients from the ambulance. That is not acceptable. The ambulances are held up, the patients are held up and the whole thing is a disaster. We have to go back 12 or 14 years when there were wards closed in Tralee hospital, which have never been reopened. We have to start there. Health is a priority in Kerry and it needs to be treated as such. Never before have so many people died in Kerry than in the past six weeks. We do not know what it is. People of all ages have died, including our lovely, talented Saoirse Buckley, who was 16 years of age, and her neighbour, 97-year-old Nellie Lovett.

She is 98 years old and she walked up into the bus, determined as anyone of 50 years of age.She walked up without a stick, a crutch or anyone assisting her but she had to travel for eight or nine hours up to the North of Ireland to get her sight back.

I have highlighted them several times already. There are 171 voids in County Kerry. That is not acceptable. The homeless centre that operated for years in Killarney has closed down because the Government has offered people €800 tax-free per month to house Ukrainians and refugees. That is €1,600 with tax. There are homeless people in Kerry. Did the Minister ever consider putting them in hotels? The Government has no problem with putting the members of other communities in hotels. There is no affordable home programme in Kerry. The Minister should not be shaking his head. There is no affordable home programme for Kerry, which other counties have for the next five years. The vacant property tax the Government tells us will compel people to sell their land is affecting farmers who cannot sell it. The Government is closing down Airbnbs.

Once again, this large carryover demonstrates the delays by the Government in undertaking the required infrastructure that is much needed by the country, including public housing. We know the delays and interruptions to capital projects as a consequence of the country dealing with Covid-19 were responsible for the significant increase in capital carryover compared with the previous year. However, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine cannot be blamed for the large carryover this year. The Minister has given no credible reason for the large carryover, and clearly this situation cannot continue indefinitely. We know that approximately €2.2 billion in funding that was announced by Ministers to much fanfare went unspent in 2021 across a number of areas, including health. We all know the problems, especially those we are having in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee and with the lack of GPs. On transport, the total figure for last year includes capital funding to the tune of €820 million, which was rolled over to 2022. There is a concern that, because significant amounts of allocated moneys are not being spent, the deadlines are missed and many project targets will be missed as a result. It is especially concerning to me that the underspending in transport and health infrastructure that occurred in 2021 is occurring again in 2022. These funds should have been used on projects that were ready to go. We must also talk about the overpowering cost of electricity and what people are saying to us on the doorsteps. The Government is talking about giving people back grants or lump sums or whatever, but the question being asked of me is why the energy regulator is not controlling the cost of electricity. Day after day the electricity companies are announcing they are trebling and quadrupling their profits and they are seeking to increase the charges again in the new year. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy McGrath, to do something about this to stop it. Do we have an energy regulator? Do we have a Minister in charge of that? If does not seem to me there is. I have mentioned to the Minister previously the local improvements schemes in Kerry. We have 660 schemes remaining on the list starting out in 2023. At the rate we are going, which is about 20 roads per year, I put it to the Minister that it will take us 38 more years to get through that list. Most of the people will be dead it will take that long.I will be long gone, although the Minister will not be because he is a young man. Those projects are listed and ready to go. They are sanctioned and approved and all we need is money. Surely if there is money that cannot be spent next year, there should be no problem with using it. Kerry County Council can do the work, and if it cannot do so, it will get contractors or whatever, but it never failed to do the work before. Back in 2004 or 2005 it did 111 roads each year, one year after the other. Someone who was a Member of the House representing Kerry at that time was able to secure that funding and ensure that where money was left over in other bank accounts or quarters, it was directed down to Kerry. It is possible to do the same now. We have so many sewerage schemes waiting to be done and there is a lot of talk these days about the environment. It may not be nice to talk about sewerage or whatever but it is a problem, it is affecting the environment and it is stopping building. I am asking the Government to look at those things and ensure that money does not go back. The Minister is taking over as Minister for Finance at the end of the week and I wish him well in that role. I look forward to asking the Minister for things for Kerry into the future. As he is a Cork man, I am sure the Minister will look favourably on us. I would hope he will do his best for Kerry. These are sensible requests. I talk about 660 roads and it is ridiculous. We must make a big dent in these next year.	spk_418
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-12-13	dail	33	Current Issues Affecting the Health Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_21	I thank Sinn Féin for bringing this very important motion to the Chamber. It gives us a chance to highlight some of the needs and deficiencies in our constituencies. In County Kerry, and in Killarney in particular, we have a critical lack of GPs to service the needs of the people across a massive area. Over 4,000 extra people - refugees and asylum seekers - have landed into Killarney in recent months. Many of these refugees are mothers with young children. They need vaccinations and all of the things that children need. Not one extra GP has been dedicated to the town of Killarney. Dr. Gary Stack, Dr. O’Regan and others are under immense pressure. They were under pressure before this current situation because they were short of staff. As a result, more people are being directed to the accident and emergency services in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee. It is having an impact there as well. I would like to raise a small matter in the context of the accident and emergency department. When people break or fracture a leg or a hand, they are directed by their GP to go for an X-ray. When they go for the X-ray, they are directed back up to the accident and emergency department to be seen by another doctor. This duplication and replication is not needed and is impacting the other people, including elderly people, who are waiting. There is no need for that. When a doctor gives a patient a letter saying that they need an X-ray, that is what they should get. They should not be clogging up the system; they should be given the X-ray. I welcome the 132-bed hospital for Killarney Community Hospital. I raised this when I was a member of the health board ten or 12 years ago. I honestly feel I was the first to raise this matter at that time. I am glad to see this happen because we have great doctors and nurses in Killarney, Tralee and elsewhere in County Kerry. We need to give them the best modern facilities they need to make their work that bit easier. We are clogging up the hospitals, including the district hospitals and University Hospital Kerry in Tralee, because of the lack of home help. People are being allocated home help hours but we do not have the people to come out and do the work. I have asked before for some of the refugees who have cars and have good English to be trained up to give them a purpose here. They are able to work like everybody else. I am asking for that to happen because I appreciate that people are very hard to get. Mental health is a serious problem in our county. People are being let down. I know that suicides happen outside of the medical spectrum - they can happen unavoidably - but many people need additional mental health services, including one-to-one services. It is not good enough. What we saw with CAMHS in south Kerry, where a junior doctor was blamed, is being replicated elsewhere. It is being replicated in north Kerry even though that doctor was not there at all. This issue needs to be dealt with all over the country. Ambulance cover is being impacted because people are on trolleys. When an ambulance arrives at a hospital and cannot unload the patient, that leaves somewhere else without an ambulance. We have had several instances where sick people have been waiting for over an hour, and for two hours in some places. I am glad that Deputy Michael Collins and I initiated a system where we take cataract patients up to the North of Ireland. We have operated 106 or 107 buses since December 2017. I will raise a final issue with the Minister and Minister of State. When someone applies for a medical card and gets it because they are entitled to get it, it should be made effective from the date they applied for it. I am just asking for that to happen because some people let it go and do not look for the medical card until they get sick.	spk_450
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-12-06	dail	33	Gambling Regulation Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_11	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about this Bill. Like all of us who have been elected to this House, we know that gambling addiction causes problems that lead to the breakup of marriages, homes and relationships and clean out businesses and farms. It is like everything; if you do it in moderation, it is fine. As with a few drinks or any substance, a little bit in moderation is fine. When it takes over, becomes an addiction and becomes compulsive, gambling can be a serious problem in many households. It has left many wives short of money at the end of the week to provide food and to look after the children in the family unit. It leaves them short of many different things. It puts their homes and their houses in jeopardy and it can end up at a point where they lose their homes. It is very sad when people who have done well and worked so hard for many years to acquire or build a home, a business or a farm see it go under the hammer because of their addiction. I am very worried about online gambling. This Bill includes the provision of betting licences, gaming licences and lottery licences, which are for in-person gambling activities and for gambling activities offered by remote means. That is the part of it I am worried about. I do not know how that can be controlled, but it should be controlled. It is ridiculous to think that people can bet away until a late hour at night, maybe after they have had a few drinks. If they were working during the day, they may not have the time to do that. I welcome the section of the Bill that continues to provide for exemptions from the requirement to hold a gambling licence for certain small-stake lotteries, such as those that help charities. Many GAA clubs run a weekly lotto. When I was in Gneeveguilla last night, I saw a group from the committee running off its lotto. They put work into that to provide funding for the necessary activities in their great club. That has been replicated right around Kerry in all the small clubs which do not get the necessary funding. It is the only way. They work hard at it and an awful lot of work goes into it. It is just €2 to buy a ticket. They collect a lot of money, and more power to them. We must allow that to continue. In the time I have left, I will say that on the ground the grim reality in Ireland is that problem gambling is growing every year. How do we tackle that? A body such as the HSE should have enough funding available to help people who have developed a gambling addiction to be treated. It should talk to them, try to come around to them and do whatever is necessary. A health research report into problem gambling in Ireland has highlighted the lack of specific services for gambling addiction being provided by the HSE. These data show the need for dedicated treatment provision for those with gambling problems. Unfortunately, this legislation does nothing to address the chronic lack of addiction support services. In addition, education is needed and awareness must be raised on a national scale, especially with teenagers in our schools, to counter the proliferation and normalisation of gambling here. The report found the most common type of gambling was buying a lottery ticket. I do not think that buying a lottery ticket is a problem. It is like everything in that it is fine if it is done in moderation but if it is done on a continuous basis, it is not fine.	spk_144

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-12-06	dail	33	Building Defects: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_17	I am glad for the opportunity, first to welcome all the people here in the Gallery who have been affected by the light-touch regulations provided for by previous Governments. We see it here in Dublin, in Donegal, in Mayo and in different counties. When we talk about Donegal, we must remember that in Donegal houses are falling down around the people. We remember Bridie Gallagher in the 1960s and 1970s who sang about the homes in Donegal, even in my father's pub. Donegal people, and everyone, depend on their homes and they look forward to going home in the evening. It is sad when their homes, apartments or whatever are falling down around them. It is terrible and it is because of light-touch regulations. To get back to the issue of Donegal, the same quarries in Donegal supplied counties such as Derry. It was the same material from the same quarries, but they took proper materials because there is no problem in the Six Counties, as has been highlighted today. Yet, we have problems here all over the country because of light-touch regulations made by previous Governments. The current Government will have to ensure that people get redress and that they will get their homes in order because a person’s home is their castle. That is the one thing that they work for. They pay mortgages in the first place and they are paying it for the greater part of their working lives. They surely do not need to have problems as they move on in years and then have their apartments and their homes falling down around them. I must speak about Kerry and the home relocation scheme that was in place to help people who were being flooded. I will mention one place in particular, Glenflesk. Because the river there had not been cleared out for years, homes became flooded and damaged. A home relocation scheme was put in place to help these people to buy other homes and to get out of the place. Sadly, at that time, the compensation they received was clearly not adequate to purchase the same quality of house away from the flood area. In recent times that river has been cleaned out and it has made a massive difference to the flooding situation. However, people’s homes were already damaged because of the stern refusal by the local authority, which would not agree to clearing out the river in the first place. Now their homes are damaged. While the river is clear now, those people who were on the relocation scheme were offered from €200,000 to €220,000. That is clearly not enough, given how costs have soared in recent times. They are not able to buy a house in another place because of the exorbitant costs. There are also places like Birchill in Aghadoe and Aghadoe village, where people paid a lot of money for houses, but the treatment plant, or the treatment plans, were not adequate. These people paid adequately for the homes they bought at that time. In recent years, the Government allocated funds to address the treatment plants but that is not sufficient now, given the rising costs. I am appealing to this Government, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke. Birchill and Aghadoe village are waiting for a proper treatment plant, as well as to be connected to the public sewer. The Government is not providing adequate funding to do that. I am appealing to the Minister to take that on board and to ensure that the people of Glenflesk, Aghadoe and Birchill get proper compensation and that they are seen after.	spk_181
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-11-23	dail	33	Transport in Galway and Other Areas: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I thank the Independent Group for giving us this opportunity. Earlier, the Minister boasted that he had spent so much money on footpaths and cycleways. That is fine where they are needed around towns and villages but what good is a cycleway, walkway or footpath in a place like Gneeveguilla or Shrone where it takes half an hour to go to work or wherever else in the morning and people have children with them and everything else? What benefit is that to those people? It is absolutely ridiculous. The Government's primary focus is on electric cars. We have to acknowledge that the batteries for these are made by child labour and slave labour in the Congo. Is the Government proud of that? There are other options, like biofuels that can be added to diesel that bring the emissions way down. The Government will not listen to those people. They have been in here to speak to us and the Government will not consider that option. Back in the mid-1970s, petrol cars could be converted to use the same gas used in cooking or whatever. There are very few emissions from that. The Government does not want to hear about it. People could use their same cars and they would be reducing emissions but it does not want to listen to that. A lot of people have to travel on the train from Killarney to Dublin. We have gone backwards with that service because before now people could get a cup of tea or coffee but there have been no canteen facilities on that train now for a number of years. It is backwards we have gone there. I ask the Minister of State to see what is wrong and at least give people making that journey of three and a half hours a cup of tea.	spk_36

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-11-23	dail	33	Finance Bill 2022: Report Stage	dbsect_19	I support this amendment, of course. We all know, as should the Minister, who deals with people as much as we do, that by increasing these taxes from next May, this will drive transport costs up. It will hurt people who are going to work in their cars and taking their children to schools. This will hurt people in rural Ireland more than in urban areas. People in rural areas need a car. They cannot travel without a car. The Minister for Transport and for the Environment, Climate and Communications said today that he was proud that the Government was spending so much money on footpaths and cycleways. As I said, when people are travelling long distances to work, a bicycle is no good to them. If they are supposed to walk, they will have to leave the day before if they have to be at work the next day because savage distances are involved. Many people in Kerry work in Cork city and travel the roads morning, noon and night. People may be taking sick people to hospital in Cork, Tralee and other places. It is all travel that cannot be managed without a car. Then take the commercial transport industry. This is going to drive the whole thing through the roof again and increase the cost of living in every way, whether it is the transport of food, agricultural goods or whatever. The Government is certainly going to drive the cost of living up further. I cannot understand why it is insisting on this, especially when the base product is so expensive. We are already paying enough taxes and carbon taxes. Even when fuel was €1.20 per litre, there was no need for the carbon tax. People have to use their cars for as long as they can. They cannot manage without them. We gave the Government ideas about liquefied petroleum gas and biofuels, but it will not entertain them. The Government is hell-bent on making people walk or maybe making them go back to using the horse and cart. There is no common sense in what it is doing by increasing the carbon tax again next May. That is totally and absolutely out of order.	spk_359

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-11-22	dail	33	Social Welfare Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_13	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about a few very important issues that I can address under the Social Welfare Bill. While I welcome the extension of the fuel allowance thresholds, I asked the Minister by way of a Topical Issue matter a year or so ago about those people who are left outside the scheme and do not qualify for it because they are on welfare benefits. For instance, a pensioner living with a cancer patient on illness benefit will not qualify for the fuel allowance. People on contributory payments, such as jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit, enhanced illness benefit, occupational injuries benefit, maternity benefit or disabled benefit will not qualify either. I raised this issue previously with this Minister. This situation is entirely wrong and not acceptable. These people would not have received benefit payments if they had not paid stamps in the first place. To think that they are ruled out of qualifying for fuel allowance is very hurtful to some. They are constantly making it known that they are being left behind. The cost of fuel is hurting and hitting so many people.The Government says it will do something about a cap but it is far too late and it is not enough. Electricity companies are raking it in. Their profits have tripled. Does this mean that the Government is taking three times the amount of tax?  Pensioners living on their own are still struggling. Perhaps a couple on two pensions are barely surviving but pensioners living on their own are really struggling to pay for everything such as a car, especially people in rural Ireland who have no public transport. As has been said, young families where parents are working must leave their children in crèches and pay baby-sitters. They are paying for fuel and everything else. Anyone on the road is murdered with extreme costs. Fuel, be it diesel or petrol, costs more than €2 per litre. It is not acceptable. The Government promised it would do something about that in the budget but it did not help those people at all. Those people are paying for us in this House while facing taxes of every creed and description. They are being driven down to the ground.  When we press the Taoiseach about a category of people who are under pressure, he invariably tells them to go to their community welfare officer as they should be entitled to the supplementary welfare payment. There are so many people who are trying to access this payment but cannot access their CWOs because there are reams of people, some of whom are coming from other countries, and they cannot get inside the door. If there are more people outside the counter, the Government must put more staff inside the counter to deal with them. It is just common sense. Telling people living in rural Ireland in places like Lauragh and Gneevgullia to come back to their social welfare office tomorrow is not satisfactory for them or for me representing them. It is not good enough. If the Government is ensuring there are more people going to community welfare offices, it needs to put more people on the other side of the counter but it has not done that. It has not provided more doctors in communities when thousands more depend on them. We were already struggling. The Government has done nothing to address that. It is not good enough to just provide a roof and a bed for people. You need to have services as well.	spk_301
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-11-22	dail	33	Declaration of a Housing Emergency: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	I am glad to get the opportunity to speak. I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this very important motion. Every week, we seem to have a debate about housing. I am beginning to worry that the debate is mainly about the capital city or the largest cities. Places like Kerry, in particular rural Kerry, seem to be left behind as far as social housing is concerned. There are 171 vacant houses in County Kerry and in Killarney alone there are over 30. There are people who have been on the housing waiting list for 14, 15 or 16 years, which is not satisfactory. The Department is demanding that €70,000 be spent on some of the houses and that they must be retrofitted, yet the Department will only allocate €11,000 for this. If the house has been a void in the past six years and got money before, no funding will be given to it. The five-year extension for planning was dropped because the Government wanted to force people in Dublin to build big developments of houses, but people with permissions for one-off houses in Kerry lost that five-year extension. Many of them came through the virus and found it tough to get money together to build a house, and they now have to go through the planning system again. The Government is trying to prevent short-term lets or force owners to rent long term but they will not because they want to have control of their houses, and they are entitled to that. The Government will not get one extra house out of that. People cannot find places to rent in Killarney. They are paying anything from €1,100 to €1,300 or €1,500 a month and they cannot find a place. We hear talk from the Government about building modular houses. Will it build them for our own people? The Government is talking about refugees but will it build them for our own people?	spk_406

We hope that by the time they are sitting in these seats, things will be much better in our country. I put it to the Minister of State that since he, the Green Party, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael came to office in 2020, more things have closed down and more harm has been done than was the case under any other previous Government. The first thing they did was to close down Bord na Móna. The latter had its operations in the middle of the country, including at Shannonbridge and Lanesborough. Since then, the cost of electricity has gone up day by day. The Government did that because it had the power to do it, not because it was the right thing to do. Since then, no proper alternative has been put in place. We have seen the way the cost of electricity has gone up so much. The thrust of our motion is that we cannot understand why people are being charged so much for electricity produced by means of wind generation. God Almighty, surely the cost of the wind has not gone up. How can the Minister of State explain that or condone it? Standing charges have also gone up. In a time of war, when we are trying to help others by welcoming them into this country, we are hurting our own and doing nothing about it. Where is the energy regulator? Where is the Minister in charge who is allowing this to happen? I am not being personal or anything, but it is the Minister's policies; it is not the policies of the people. These policies are wrong. We hear about this big meeting - out in wherever it is - which is COP27. Many of the people who are attending that meeting should cop on. The people of Ireland can see what is happening. The Chinese are building coal-burning generation stations at present. They are adding to the 2,290 stations they already have. They are building 500 more and planning for a further 300 after that. The Germans are burning coal, and here we have the Government telling us, after all that we have been through, that people cannot buy a bag of turf or sell a bag of turf. I am honestly proud of and admire the people who went to the bog this summer. The Minister played no small part in that because he highlighted that he would bid to stop people cutting turf. They proved that they can still cut it. While many of them had gone over to oil or other things that prevented them from going to the bog, I assure the House that more people than ever went back to the bog this year, and they will be going again next year. I am proud that, with the onset of winter, many people can look into their fires and derive the heat that comes from a good turf fire. All the big powers are attending this COP27 event. The Minister is flying there first class, and yet the Government is telling people here that they cannot burn turf and that they should not be warm. Now it has the gall to tell people in public offices that they cannot boil a kettle. What are they at? Have they gone stone loony altogether? I know an elderly woman who is afraid to boil a kettle because it will actually add to her electricity bill. There are many more like her.God almighty, I am appealing to the Minister of State. Government Members are more reactive than proactive. They are talking about introducing a cap now. We asked for this all year. Businesses are going to ground. Butchers who sell abroad are closing down. This will have an adverse effect because finished cattle are down €200 or €300 in price. Many butchers have closed already and it is affecting the trade. I ask the Government to cop on, make the regulator do his job and ensure that the energy companies do not get two or three times the profit they should get at the expense of the ordinary punter trying to light the light, boil the kettle or keep their business going.	spk_22

Many are living in hotels in Killarney, Tralee, Ballybunion and other places. It is estimated that there are more than 6,000 in the county now, with almost 4,000 housed in hotels and guest houses in Killarney. Our town of Killarney is at capacity. If we are to look after our own people and the refugees and the asylum seekers who are already here properly, it is clear that we cannot accommodate any more at this time. Our medical services, GPs and social welfare officers are under immense pressure. Come the middle of February 2023, what alternative accommodation does the Government have in mind for the massive number of refugees who are housed in our hotels and guest houses at present? The children who have come here have been integrated into our schools. Our tourism product and our hospitality business in Kerry depend so much on these hotels to provide accommodation for tourists. They are the vital cog in the wheel that keeps the industry going. It is vital for employment for people in craft shops, souvenir shops, tea and coffee shops, confectionery shops, bus and coach tour operators, taxi and hackney operators, jarveys in Killarney and the Gap of Dunloe, the boatmen, the big entertainment venues, such as the INEC and Siamsa Tíre in Tralee, small rural pubs that provide music and entertainment, storytelling and culture and tell visitors about traditions, and our entertainers and musicians. All our visitor attractions depend so much on hotel accommodation being available. We have places like Killarney House and Gardens, Muckross House Gardens and Traditional Farms, the national park, our wonderful visitor centres in Ballinskelligs and Dingle and many other attractions. The Taoiseach has spoken about building modular homes. Where will they be built? Will modular homes be built for our people? We must look after our own. Some people have been on the housing list in Killarney for up to 16 years. We want to treat the Ukrainian people properly but we do not want to treat them better than our own people. We need to look after our own people. We need to realise that the businesses I have mentioned are only barely back on their feet after being closed down for two years. What are the Government's plans. How is the Government going to address the accommodation centre for Ukrainians in Killarney after the middle of February?	spk_64

How will he deal with the refugees who are supposed to leave those hotels by the end of February? What accommodation has he arranged for them at the end of February? I told him that so many aspects of our tourism sector have only barely started back on their feet again this year. It has been a bare few months. Surely, they should not have to lose out or be compromised because the hotels are not free.

I thank Sinn Féin for affording us the opportunity. I also thank all the firemen in the Gallery. I thank those who spoke to me outside the gates, some of whom were from Kerry. They had to go back because they are on duty tonight and have no way out of it. Another Kerry Deputy suggested that all the Kerry Deputies should support the firefighters. I can say to that Deputy that I have always supported the firefighters. I do not have to be told by him or anyone else to support the firefighters. I recognise the great work they do on the ground when they are called out. Teddy McCarthy, who was already mentioned, is from Sneem and his name comes to mind in this discussion. He acts as an ambulance in many instances because he arrives on the scene hours before an ambulance comes to that rural place. It must be recognised that these men have oxygen and all the things they need to help, including defibrillators and whatever else, and to ensure a person is kept alive. They can reduce a person's pain. They do so much more.  It has been pointed out to me that a fireman cannot be depended on to mind the children while his wife goes shopping because he could be gone when she comes back from the shop. Perhaps such a man would have to take the children with him to the fire station and ring someone to have the children collected. What kind of a life is that? Some of them are only being paid €175 to be retained 24-7. Imagine that. They are only paid €175 to be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They cannot go or live more than five minutes away from the fire station. It is the same as being tied to the leg of the bed. They cannot go anywhere or do anything. It is a job that ties people down. I say to the Minister of State that the Government will have to recognise the calls and claims of these people for proper pay.	spk_288

I want to raise something else with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. It is urgent and needs to be addressed. I want to talk about a girl who has serious intellectual and physical disabilities. She has been in and out of St. Mary of the Angels for many years as a respite patient but since her father died over a year ago, she has been full-time in St. Mary of the Angels because her mother cannot care for her. This big, strong girl is nearly 40 years of age but it takes an awful lot of work to handle and mind her. Now the HSE and St. John of God Hospital are saying that this girl must leave this residential care and the only other place she has to go-----	spk_48

They say they are doing it for this decongregation model. They want to move her to County Meath. That is not acceptable. I am appealing to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in the strongest terms not to let the HSE take this mother to court to make her daughter a ward of court.	spk_50

They started with Kerry County Council and they should finish out their time there. Any of those who started with the council should be let finish their time in the council. I know they work for Irish Water now but it is different to move the employment across. I do not think it is fair on them. We have to recognise the great work they do, as I said, at unearthly hours.

According to the Government, the intention is to respond to the economic difficulties resulting from the aggression against Ukraine by Russia by creating a specific Ukraine credit guarantee scheme. However, the problem with rising energy prices started long before the war in Ukraine, which started around 26 February. The skyrocketing Irish energy prices are largely caused by three factors. The ongoing dysfunctional energy policy position places an effective ban on new domestic energy sources that are not renewable. If we are to talk about the dismantling of the Shannonbridge and Lanesborough power stations, every day since they were closed the cost of electricity has gone up. I welcome credit being made more easily available to businesses across the board. However, we do not want businesses to go into debt. The cause of many of them being in trouble is the cost of electricity, petrol and diesel. When we talk about the cost of living going up, it is basically all due to the cost of energy. There are so many things we could be self-sufficient in. I do not agree with all this climate change because the records tell us that climate change happened back over the years.I do not agree that what we are doing is the cause of it, including the people cutting enough turf to keep themselves warm for the winter. I am proud of the people who go out and cut their own turf and are keeping themselves warm when the rain and bad weather come. I am proud of those people and they are proud of themselves for being self-sufficient. We know members of the Government are not happy about it. Do they want those people to be cold? The cost of heating oil today is €1.40 or €1.50 a litre. It costs an enormous amount at this time to fill a tank. People are putting only €300 or €400 worth of oil in to keep themselves going for a couple of weeks. This country survived during the Second World War because of turf. The Government seems to be blaming the current war for everything. Surely we should be doing things to help ourselves to be as self-sufficient as we can be, not pandering to Russia by buying its coal and being dependent on it for gas. We should be storing gas in the old Kinsale Head gas field. We could have bought enough gas during the summer, when it was much cheaper, and stored it there for use. We could be developing the oil field off Barryroe, from which we could derive gas, petrol and oil distillates. Likewise, deposits of gas were found off the Kerry coast but, in 2019, the then Taoiseach, who is now the Tánaiste, took away the licences from the prospective operators who were going to drill there. We could now be exporting gas to other parts of the world if we sourced our own gas. Instead, the Government has cut off its nose to spite its face. It does not understand the harm it is doing to the poor honest people who are trying to live, keep a roof over their heads and travel to work faced with the high cost of petrol and diesel. The cost of electricity is another problem. The Government is saying it will introduce a windfall tax and give it back to the people. Why is it allowing the electricity companies to charge so much that they are tripling their profits? Is it because the Government is getting triple the amount of taxes out of them? Where is the energy regulator? Where is the Minister who is in charge of this? The people in Kerry I represent, like people in the areas other Deputies represent, are totally disenchanted by this type of policy. Why are the energy companies not being curtailed at this time?	spk_315

I sympathise on behalf of my entire family and the people of Kerry and send our sincerest sympathies to everyone. I pay tribute to elected members in Dáil Éireann and in Donegal and those who helped in every way. When this unspeakable tragedy happened, Irish people all over the country and the world were horrified. We never dreamed it could happen in any part of our country. Donegal is much like Kerry. We are the same kind of people, living with the Atlantic Ocean to our backs. We are horrified by what has happened. May God give the families strength to carry on and live for tomorrow. I wish to say to the families that it is good to have known the loved ones they have lost and to try to carry on and do their best.

Elderly people have a natural desire to stay in their homes as long as they can. It would surely benefit the State if they could be treated and minded in their homes as they should be. Many elderly people have a fear of going into a nursing home or a long-stay hospital bed because they fear it is the departure lounge they are going into. They dread that. There is humanity in people. I have had several people call me to say they have been allocated home help but there is nobody coming out. Family members are also ringing. They are doing their best to keep their elderly relatives at home. I have suggested asking these new arrivals into our country from Ukraine or wherever. People with cars and those with good English should be enticed or at least asked. Goddamn it but they have two hands, two legs and a head like we do. I worry when elderly people go into hospital and family members cannot go into see them, as has happened. It broke my heart during Covid-19. People died alone in nursing homes and hospitals while their relatives could not go in. I can honestly say that some of them died of hunger because there was nobody to spoon the food into their mouths. That actually happened and I know it. If I am driven to it, I will tell where it happened. I only talk about what I know about. Do not impose restrictions on family members going into hospitals or nursing homes any more, for any reason.	spk_149
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-10-26	dail	33	Social and Affordable Housing Supply: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	dbsect_9	I thank People Before Profit for tabling the motion and giving us an opportunity to talk about these very serious issues that are neglected in the housing programme. A week or so ago, Councillor Maura Healy-Rae tabled a motion in Kerry County Council asking how many vacant houses, voids, were in the county, and the number was 171. I am glad the Minister is in the Chamber because I want to put this to him straight. The Government is boasting and blathering about the housing programme that it is responsible for. Perhaps it is doing it somewhere else, but it is not doing it in Kerry or for the people of Kerry. Perhaps Dublin is being looked after again. When a house becomes void in Kerry, the housing section is told it has to bring it back to a standard whereby it has to be deep-retrofitted and everything else that goes with it, and it costs €60,000 to €70,000, yet the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in Dublin will give only €11,000 towards the house. The Minister can shake his head but I am saying it here and it is on the record of the House. If the house comes back into use after less than six years, the owner will get no bob at all. There are 171 such houses in Kerry, and if the Minister says he is doing something about the housing market, I am asking him now to give money and sort this out. Many of these houses have been void or vacant for years. I can name a lot of them. I ask the Minister to raise the housing cap because it is not acceptable with the cost of living. Moreover, the family income supplement, where it is included in their income, should be disregarded and I ask the Minister to do that. Some single people and families have been on the list in Killarney and Kerry for 13 to 16 years. Will the Minister announce the repair grant scheme for vacant houses outside of towns and villages and give details of it?	spk_34

I, too, am looking at this from both sides. I really feel for the people who have to give up their tenancy or whatever or when they get notice to quit, mothers with maybe three children, couples and young children. So many times there is a human side to their story. It is sad that we are not improving and have not improved the situation. For the number of years I have been up here now, the situation has not improved. In fact, it is getting way worse. It is sad for the people who have nowhere to go. This eviction ban that the Government is putting in place now until the end of March will do nothing to encourage landlords or householders to stay in the private renting business. It is one of the reasons that they will get out of it and sell their houses or do something else. If we want control, and I believe that someone who buys or pays for a house - first of all I should have declared that my brother is an owner of some houses, I do not know how many, I will not ask him. I have only my own house anyway. It is so tough on people. I know someone who has their house sold for a number of months, and they have notice given to someone to quit for over two years. It is a well-heeled professional man and he will not get out of the house. That is not encouraging other house-owners or landlords to stay in the renting business. Our homeless centres are not adequate, where couples with children are directed into a homeless centre where there are other people with addiction, noise and everything and small quarters. I say to the Minister of State and I really mean it that the Government had no problem in the world in directing and finding a hotel in the Park Road in Killarney for 193 asylum seekers, and it is putting more of them into Ballybunion.I am asking the Government to find proper rental accommodation for our own people who become homeless and to look after them in the same way it looks after the hundreds of thousands who come here from other countries. We have enough of them at this time and we need to cap that story and give it up until the Government is able to look after them. It is not doing that and it is leaving our own behind. There are 171 vacant houses in Kerry. I am directly blaming the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for this because he is demanding that those houses be deep retrofitted, which will cost €60,000 or €70,000 in each case. However, the Department is giving only €11,000 towards that. If homeowners got a grant in the past six years, they will not get a euro or a penny to bring their houses back into use. Heretofore, the council was able to rely on the tenant purchase scheme to bring voids back into use but that scheme is no longer working. The ban on Airbnb letting and other short-term letting is not going to help people to rent long term.	spk_228
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-10-26	dail	33	Development (Emergency Electricity Generation) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_19	The Minister does not want turf or gas. God only knows what he wants. The Government Deputies themselves certainly do not know. Every day since the Government closed down Bord na Móna, the cost of electricity has gone up. The Government has sabotaged the country. It has left the people not sure whether they will have electricity despite the savage bills they are paying. Old women are afraid to boil the kettle at present because they are afraid they will cause a strain on the electricity grid. Like Deputy Mattie McGrath said, the Government is thinking about pouring concrete into the pipeline at Kinsale. We will need gas for many years. The wind does not blow all the time. No matter how many more turbines are put up, the wind does not blow all the time. We will need gas into the medium to long-term future because the Government will not even keep the turf generation stations it closed down. The Minister talks about just transition. There was no just transition. The Minister closed those stations down the minute he got power. It was a sad day for the people of the country when the Minister became part of the Government. I have no bother in the world in telling him this because he has blackguarded the people with the way he is carrying on, charging them any amount for electricity and talking about coming back with a windfall tax. Where is the regulator? Why does it not control what companies are charging? Now, we hear the Minister is going to bring jet engines, something he knows an awful lot about, of course. They are not going to be running on fossil fuels at all but aviation fuel. What are the emissions going to be out of that? Does the Minister realise that, back in the 1930s or 1920s, the one ambition of Éamon de Valera and the first Taoiseach was to be self-sufficient. Where are we now? We have our fingers stuck inside every other fellow's mouth all over the world. Even as late as last year, we were buying coal from Putin to keep Moneypoint power station going and the Government thought people would not find out. That is what they are doing, however. The Government has no respect or regard for the people it is representing.	spk_252

All we ever ask in a budget is that the Minister and the Government be fair with all sectors of the people. That has not happened in this budget. Sadly, people depending on diesel- and petrol-fuelled cars, where they have no other option, together with lorry men who are on the road day after day, were promised throughout the summer that the Government would help them in the budget and it did nothing at all for them. The Government is saying that whatever few pence it did give them off the cost of fuel last May or June will end at the end of February and the first day of March next year. The Minister is saying he is managing the finances well and that is how he has the €11 billion, but I say to him that most of that €11 billion is money he collected off people on the road. Four years ago the barrel of oil was cheaper than it is now. At the same time, everyone is paying double except the farmers who are paying a great deal more. The Minister gave them two cents off. They are paying €1.50 a litre now, which is almost three quarters the cost of white diesel. Heretofore, they were only paying a third of the cost. I told the Minister to reconsider the concrete levy. He considered it a bit all right but he is still leaving it at 5% and that is too much because, like I said, people who are buying materials to build a house are paying extra VAT and tax on these materials already. They are paying extra for concrete already, which has gone up from €80 to €115 a cubic metre. These people are paying extra VAT and tax to the Government already. On housing, the Government makes such a hullabaloo and acclaim about the housing policy it has. We see, however, where in Kerry there are 171 vacant houses and the Government will not provide the funding to put both houses or voids back into production. What is wrong with the Minister?Would it not be very easy to do that? These 171 houses have been vacant for three or four years. What is wrong with the Government that it will not deal with that? On the cost of electricity, there is no account of the regulator at all. The electricity companies are allowed to double and triple their profits. We would not mind paying more for electricity if it cost them more to generate it. We see how hard it is for some people to get social welfare payments. Many pensioners will not receive the €500 bonus because they do not get fuel allowance or the living alone allowance. Despite this, there are Ukrainian men of fighting age here getting the same dole and supports as others even though they are being housed, fed and every other thing. All I am asking for is fair play across the board. Irish people who have been here all of their lives are not getting that fair play. I ask the Minister to look at those things and to review some of the decisions the Government has made because they are very unfair.	spk_282

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-10-25	dail	33	Public Transport: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_15	I thank Sinn Féin for this important motion but there are many parts of rural Kerry that do not have public transport at all. If we are honest, there is not enough money in the Central Bank to service all of rural County Kerry with public transport because it is so expansive and places are so remote. However, we want people to live there and we want to assist in whatever way we can. There is certainly a problem with hackneys and taxis in rural towns and villages during the week and even at weekends because, if drivers are busy in the likes of Killarney or Kenmare, smaller places like Kilgarvan and other rural places have a problem getting public transport. I honestly believe that taxis and hackneys should be subsidised during the day. There are no taxis or hackneys working during the day in many parts of rural Kerry. We appreciate the Local Link service, which does wonderful work, but it does not catch everyone. In that regard, there should be some scheme to facilitate taxis and hackneys to help rural people do their shopping or other things they need to do to take the monotony out of their lives. When the Government brought in the most recent drink-driving laws, which affected many rural people in many ways, it said that it would find a way to transport them to and from the local pub. However, I am sad that the only place you would see a queue or crowd that has anything to do with drink is at a bottle bank because most drinking is now done at home. You may not be sure of meeting many people in the pub but you will meet them around the bottle bank. That is the effect of the Government's laws. It is now talking about opening pubs or discos later.	spk_324

There is a shortfall in funding for the Kerry Parents and Friends Association and I ask the Minister to address it. I appreciate that discussions have taken place and further discussions are to take place. However, I am also asking the Minister to ensure that these valuable people get the €1,000 that has been paid to other staff in other sections of the HSE. They are definitely entitled to it, without a shadow of a doubt. Section 39 workers do the very same work as section 38 workers. Why is a distinction made between them? All over the world, people fight for equal rights. I am asking that the same rights be given to these section 39 workers, especially in the Kerry Parents and Friends Association in Killarney.	spk_151

I welcome anything that would help tourism in the country and, indeed, in Kerry. All of us are privileged to be elected to this Chamber to represent the people who elected us from whatever part of the country. However, I feel that being a Deputy from Kerry, I have an advantage because I am representing the best county in the country and in the world as far as tourism is concerned, because as has been said before Kerry is the tourism capital of the world. Whether one meets someone from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Kansas or wherever, they all know about Kerry and they know about Killarney. We have that advantage but we cannot stand still. We need to advertise, emphasise and tell the people. We need to treat the people who come today properly and hospitality in Kerry does just that whether they are in Killarney, Ballybunion, Dingle, Kenmare or Cahersiveen. We have hotels, guesthouses and pubs and we do it very well. I thank all the owners, proprietors and managers and the workers for the extra care they take of the visitors who come to Kerry, because they know what it is about in that if they do a good job, they will reap the rewards because people will come back. That is what we wish to ensure. We also thank the coach operators who had such a tough time over the past two or three years, for the way they do their job and treat the people who travel with them so well. We have restaurants, cafés and pubs and we have the INEC events centre in Killarney which is second to none.It is a town within a town given what it offers. Last Saturday night, the Kilfenora Céilí Band was playing in one part of it and Gina and the Champions in another. It just shows in the middle of October what kinds of attractions are being provided. Bing Crosby, the famous crooner, said when he sung of Killarney, and it was the same of Kerry, that daytime or nighttime, he liked to be there. We are very proud of Kerry and all it does. Tourism is so important. I am sad that Airbnbs are going to be blown out of it. People are concerned their incomes will be nullified because of what is happening. These people provided a type of accommodation that was needed for people who could only spend so much on it. They were providing an excellent service. I worry for the Killarney electoral area. As it is a rent pressure zone, it is being said that people can no longer advertise Airbnb accommodation, which will have a disastrous effect on Killarney and County Kerry in general. I am also worried because so much of our hotel and guesthouse accommodation taken up by refugees. While we want to see after those who are there, there must be a cap put on the numbers. We cannot see after the refugees we have already and we cannot see after our own people. If take the social welfare offices and the doctors, there is more to seeing after these refugees and asylum seekers than just putting them into a bed and putting a roof over their heads. There is so much more involved and we need to have a proper debate in this Chamber on the number of refugees and asylum seekers we are accepting because in Killarney we are full. That is the word that is coming back from there.	spk_308

The Government has to accept that since it closed down Lanesborough and Shannonbridge power stations in the middle of the country, electricity has increased every whole day. As the cost of generating electricity had gone up so much, we were all resigned to the fact that we would have to pay more, but what do we find? Electricity companies are doubling and tripling their profits. There is no account of the energy regulator, or the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is in charge of the energy regulator. There is no account of anyone. The people are being blackguarded and the Government does not mind because it is taking more tax and VAT from the exorbitant bills people receive. Perhaps Europe will let us introduce a windfall tax or whatever, but the Government is only codding or trying to cod the people. The electricity companies are doubling and tripling their profits and the Government will do nothing about it and there is no account of the energy regulator. Today, home heating oil costs €1.50 per litre. How are poor people going to heat their houses while the Minister is trying to stop people from cutting turf? There is no doubt about it that he would blackguard the people if he could get away with it, but many people cut their turf and I am glad tonight - it is a bad night - that they are looking into their fires at home in Kerry. Diesel is over €2.05 per litre and the Government will do nothing about it. The price of a barrel of oil is less today than it was four years ago, but where are the profits going? They are going into the Government's coffers. The people are being blackguarded and there is no account of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, demanding anything of the energy regulator.	spk_346

As has been noted by many speakers, the section 39 workers in the community and voluntary sector are not being properly paid and they have not received a pay increase for 14 years. We have only to look at this year and the way the cost of living has gone up - it has practically doubled in the past 12 months - to know that these people cannot be expected to keep going with the rate of pay they are getting at present. They do such important work, whether it is in the childcare sector or helping people with mental health problems, in rural social schemes and delivering meals on wheels to elderly people who can no longer make a meal for themselves. This ensures they can stay in their homes for as long as possible without going into a nursing home or hospital. They do such valuable work for all those people. We thank the workers for the great work they do in all of our communities and for keeping places looking so well, including entrances to towns. Local authorities do not have the funding or operatives to do this kind of work. The workers themselves are glad to be out in the morning and playing a part in their community and leaving the signs of their handiwork on so many parts of our towns and villages. The fruits of their work are to the benefit of all the people who live in these rural places especially. If they were not there, these places would be very shoddy and out of shape. We thank the workers and supervisors. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the workers are treated the same as every other worker and not to have them waiting for 14 years for a pay rise.	spk_46

Work permits come up all the time. In the past week, a plasterer was on to me looking to get a plasterer in from another country. He has been held up all year. He went through all the hoops. He had to advertise in the local paper and had to do so a second time. He had to contact social welfare in writing so many times. It costs more than €2,000. The system needs to be streamlined. In these scenarios, whether it is a worker in construction, hospitality or farming or drivers, excavator drivers or lorry drivers, they can have all the accreditations, tickets and so on but you do not really know until they arrive whether they are suitable or not and whether they will work out. There should be some sort of a temporary certificate or permit that you could get for three months or so to see how they work out. After all, it costs more than €2,000 and takes a great deal of work. There are about four Departments involved with which you have to make contact to get a person through. At different times over the past couple of weeks, I have raised the possibility of training Ukrainian women to do home help. We have a dire need for home help workers in Kerry. Elderly people have been allocated so many home help hours by the HSE but no one turns up because we are told it does not have the staff. It would be ideal if those women could be trained, including those who have cars and those who have English. They have to be English speaking to deal with elderly people. The system we have is too intricate for small employers. It may be all right for professionals, doctors and so on, their CVs will stand for themselves, but it is not enough if you employ a driver who will say he drove this and that. He may have tickets for it but when he arrives he may not be able to drive a pram. The €2,000 cost and the amount of red tape involved is too much for many of the people I have talked about. I ask the Minister of State to streamline it in some way so that it would be possible to get in workers on a temporary basis. The story in Killarney has been mentioned where 193 asylum seekers arrived a number of days ago. They arrive at the Quality Hotel on the Park Road in Killarney where there was already 135 Ukrainian women and their children, many of whom had settled and integrated into the town. They were working in hotels and the children had been bought school uniforms and were at school but they were given 48 hours to leave the hotel and go to Westport. We saw the Government at its best, playing politics with these poor people in this unfortunate situation. The Government accepted the 193 men and directed them to the Quality Hotel in Killarney where there was already 134 women and children. Then we had Deputy Griffin, the deputy Government Chief Whip, challenging the Government of which he himself is part for bringing them to Killarney. Last evening, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, said there was no going back and that the Ukrainian women and children would have to leave Killarney and go to Westport even though the children had got their school uniforms and were integrated into the community. Then this morning, some time after 10 a.m., the Minister, Deputy Foley, announced that she had got the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to allow the Ukrainian women to remain in Killarney even though I was made aware at 3 p.m. yesterday that they would be allowed to remain there. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, said yesterday evening that there was no going back but then the Minister, Deputy Foley, came out this morning with an announcement, saying she was a great woman and had it all sorted out.

They will help some people but many will be left behind. I, along with many others, could understand the cost of electricity going up, if the cost of producing it was going up. We now find, however, that the electricity companies are doubling, tripling and quadrupling their profits. Where is the regulator? Where is the Minister who is in charge of the regulator? What are they doing? Why are they allowing this to happen? Yes, the Taoiseach has said he will fight like a big man for a windfall tax in Europe but the problem is here. We have no regulator and no Minister who is responsible for the regulator. People are being robbed day after day for electricity that they should be paying far less for. I am glad for all the people throughout the country who were able to cut turf for themselves because those people who have turf have surety that they will not be cold this winter. There is nothing more homely than to sit around a blazing turf fire. I thank the Minister, Deputy Ryan, for creating awareness when he said that people could not cut turf because that is when they got out to cut it in the fine weather and saved it. We are glad that happened. We are leaving 10,000 acres of bog behind us in Littleton. We have grand bogs in Barna, Foilbee, Reaboy, Rea na Colli and other locations. All these places could be utilised way more. Shannonbridge was closed down and every day since then the cost of electricity has gone up day after day. The Government will not allow us to open Shannon LNG or Barryroe. The Corrib gas field could be explored more deeply and the Kinsale gas field could be used as storage. We need to reverse the decision of the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, when he was Taoiseach, to cancel drilling services in 2019. The Taoiseach says every day that anyone in financial trouble should go to his or her community welfare office. I know of a man who is 80 years of age who is having financial trouble in accessing treatment.He went to the community welfare officer to get financial help. He was in the office for an hour and a half. There was a group of refugees in front of him. When he proceeded to go up to the man at the counter - there was only one person there - he was told to go back to the queue and that all of the other 23 or 24 people were in front of him. If the Taoiseach is good enough to suggest that people should go to the community welfare officer, will he put more people on the counters to deal with and see after our own people, as well as the refugees?  Deputy Griffin created a hullabaloo here today about refugees being displaced from Killarney because other refugees came into the place they were in. I remind Deputy Griffin, who will be watching this debate from somewhere, that he is part of the Government that brought the 193 men into Killarney to upscuttle the refugees who were already there. Not only does he vote for everything the Government does, but he rounds up all of the backbenchers to vote for every notion Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Green Party think up.	spk_226
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-10-11	dail	33	Disability Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	I thank Deputy Tully for tabling this very important motion. Since I was elected in 2016, I believe that one cohort of people has been totally and utterly neglected; namely, elderly parents who are now in their 70s and 80s. They would be doing good enough to look after themselves without needing home helps and carers to do so, but they are also trying to mind older children who cannot mind themselves. These are strong boys and girls whose parents are not physically able to manage them anymore because they have to be lifted and may have to be restrained, etc. They are burdened with this and the biggest worry they have, when they go to their grave, is who will look after their son or daughter who is not well or has never been well since birth. These parents have gone through so much that you would think that when they reach 70 years of age the State and the HSE, which gets so much money to provide help to everyone, would look after them. St. Mary of the Angels is a wonderful facility for these kinds of people. This place is being closed by stealth because it is deemed to be a congregated setting that the health service wants to close down. I will say to the Minister that there is a place for facilities like St. Mary of the Angels, where there are all types of services, including a swimming pool, that can manage a number of people. Some 70 or 80 people were looked after there for years. Now, when someone dies, that bed is closed down. That is wrong because this place was donated to the health service by the Doyle family. It includes a significant amount of land where all kinds could be built on it, instead of trying to close it. I will give one example. One elderly resident in St. Mary of the Angels, who is not able to look after herself, has a mother who is alone. That resident is now being told that she will have to leave and go to one of the most northern counties in the Twenty-six Counties, not 10 miles away from the Border.	spk_262

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-10-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_25	The Valuation Office is conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties in County Kerry as part of the programme to revalue all such properties in the State. In the last week, many people in the county have been shocked by the proposed valuation figures they have received. Traders and operators from all walks of life in all parts of the county are terrified at the proposed doubling and tripling of their rates demands, from one-man operators, small garages and repair shops, small pubs and shops, hardware stores, restaurants, hairdressers, chemists, bakers, butchers and sweet shops to the big employers such as hotels, fabricators and manufacturing companies like Liebherr, Munster Joinery, concrete products and the likes. Traders are told if they do not accept, they can appeal but a valuation officer has a right to visit the property. It is quite possible that many traders will close when they size up the situation they find themselves in. It is easier to keep doors open now than to try to get them to reopen later. I call on the Tánaiste to defer this process. Things are bad enough. People are struggling to survive after Covid, Brexit and now the massive increase in energy and all other costs. People should only be assessed on profits, not on sales or the market rental value.This revaluation was postponed back in 2020 because of the virus. I ask that this process be deferred for the foreseeable future, especially because of increased energy costs while many traders are just finding their feet this year. They had the support payments from the Government over the last two years but trading after the pandemic has changed for many businesses, not least those that cannot operate online delivery services of supplies of food, clothes, furniture, parts and all types of goods and materials. They are disadvantaged because they must have a physical building on the side of a street. If a shop closes down, it adversely affects all other businesses on the street. One owner of a restaurant told me he has to pay for rent, increased wages, PRSI, PAYE, insurance, electricity, water, refuse and VAT, which is going up next March. The prices for heating and cooking oil have gone mad. This man's rates are proposed to go from €31,000 to €60,000. For others, rates will increase from €1,500 to €5,000 and €24,000 to €58,000 in places like Killarney, Tralee, Listowel, Kenmare, Dingle, Cahersiveen and Rathmore. Everyone who got a proposed valuation was given a figure - let us say it was €15,000 - and told to multiply that by 0.227 when they asked to get the real proposed figure. Why could the Valuation Office not have the correct figure it was proposing included in the document in the first place?	spk_222

The local authority has said it will not benefit from the revaluation but the valuation has not come down for any of the people I have met on the street and around Kerry. I cannot understand that. I know of one person for whom it came down by €100 but it is more than doubling in many cases. Many of these traders are renting. They cannot afford another increase on top of all the increases they have to deal with now. The Government was able to defer it in 2020 for the virus and it has the power to do so again and review it. I am asking that people be dealt with based on whether they are making profit. If they are not making profit, it is very unfair to charge them on the rental value of their property or their sales because sales do not reflect the profit. That is what is wrong with this whole thing.	spk_224

On the matter of free and accessible public transport, we are told and we see that Dublin city has eight times more public transport than the rest of Ireland. I ask the Minister of State to think about this fact. I reiterate that Dublin city alone has eight times more public transport than the rest of Ireland. While I appreciate there is a need for free public transport, in very rural places, such as we have in Kerry and Donegal, we must realise that it would be impossible to provide free public transport for everyone unless we have all the money there is in the Central Bank. The Government must realise there is still a need for cars, whether those are powered by petrol, diesel or electricity, as long as those sources provide a viable and reliable option. We still need cars and people need assistance.There is no alternative for those people who need to go to work, school and elsewhere. I, too, thank the Local Link services for the great work they do in getting elderly people out a couple of times a week to their local town or village, such as Curragh, Scartaglin, Brosna, Kenmare and Lauragh. They do great work. On this notion the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, had that one car would do 30 people in one village and to place the car in the village, that man is for the fairies. The more we go on, the more I realise that this Government has no idea what is happening in rural Ireland.	spk_44

I understand the need to regulate and ensure that the patient receives the best treatment at all times because we are all fine until we get sick. When people present with some problem, they need to be treated properly. In that vein I must mention the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Kerry. The problem of teenagers and young adults being overmedicated appeared in south Kerry some months ago and now it is manifesting in north Kerry. My concern now is that this may be widespread throughout the country. Is it the policy of the HSE to just drug people up in order to calm them down or whatever? If that is so, I do not think it was right to do that. In south Kerry, a junior doctor was blamed, but now it is in north Kerry. People have problems at the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee with the queues and all that is going on there. What has been allowed to happen and allowed not to happen in that hospital is totally unsavoury. We in the hinterland of Kerry, all the way down into Cahersiveen and Valentia Island, and even people from parts of north-west Cork and west Limerick, depend on the hospital so much. People who become sick are waiting for hours or even days. Elderly people, some 90 years of age, have sometimes been on a trolley for a day, a day and a half or two days. Recently a 92-year-old woman spent two and a half days on a trolley. Other speakers have mentioned this issue. It is the natural desire of elderly people to stay in their homes for as long as they can. They feel they are being sent to the departure lounge if they have to go into a nursing home for the end of their days. They are really worried that the end is near. If they had home help, they could stay in their homes much longer. The problem is that people get an allocation for the extra time they need, but then no one turns up.	spk_248

I have a proposal to make on it. I realise as much as anyone else that the staff are not there and the HSE cannot get them.Thousands of Ukrainian people have arrived on our shores. Could the English-speaking people from this country be trained up? I believe they have cars and everything. Could they be trained up to become part of the home help force even in Kerry? Just the English-speaking ones because I realise it would not work going into a house to elderly people if they did not understand the people. We have a shortage of consultants. As a result, procedures are not happening and people are languishing and suffering adverse effects due to different consultants not being available. One man can only do so much, whatever his area is. Likewise we have a shortage of GPs in every area of Kerry, including south Kerry. I am only wondering what we can do as elected Members here to ensure that we have an adequate number of GPs. God almighty, if some sick and elderly person at home rings a GP's office today, Wednesday, they will be very lucky to be seen next Monday. The Minister of State knows that hours and time are important to people when they are sick. We are training as many nurses as any other country but they are not staying. Why? Are we not paying them properly? We hear they are going to Dubai and Australia. I happen on to an awful lot of what was long ago called an American wake, when someone was leaving our shores to go abroad for employment. I am happening across a lot of these now. They are going to Australia, Dubai and everywhere. Can we not do something to entice them or reward them sufficiently that they do not have to think about that again? For a long time we did have enough professionals. We are here today discussing regulating professionals but the sad fact is that we do not have enough in all the areas I mentioned. Carers, those who are caring for family members, are not really being appreciated at home. They do not get sufficient time off or whatever. It is a tough struggle for some of them who find themselves minding a wife, a husband or some sick child, God help us, as a result of accidents and different things. I have requested this before. It happens farmers a lot that they have an accident or get sick and find themselves in hospital. Then there is a panic that they do not have a medical card. They apply for a medical card but it takes a number of weeks to process, and we all recognise that. I am asking that from the day the person makes the application, if they qualify for the medical card later, the medical card is dated to the day the application was sent in. Between that time and the date they get the medical card, there is a bill accruing that they cannot afford. It seems very logical to me. We can do it with other applications in social welfare and different things, so that the date the application goes in is the date the person becomes eligible. Why not with the medical card? I appreciate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle allowing me to raise these very important things.	spk_258
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-10-05	dail	33	Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_18	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about this very important matter. We all welcome anything that would help to reduce the cost of insurance and regulate the amount of claims and awards that are made. Some sizeable amounts have been given to people who were blackguarding the system, taking advantage and making false claims because we all know it has been increasing the cost of insurance. We all accept that insurance is there for a purpose. If someone has had a genuine accident - whether it is on the road, in the workplace or wherever, it is there to ensure that they are properly compensated and remunerated to the level they are entitled to. We do not want to deny anyone the right to claim for what they are entitled to, but sadly we have seen cases of whiplash claims going back over the years and the savage awards that were given by judges to these people. We have even seen claims for whiplash with €77,000 being awarded here in this country and for the same type of claim £7,000 is awarded over in the UK. As I have said here previously, do those people here in Ireland have a brass neck or was it a gold neck they had to get such a sizeable amount? That was very unfair and was militating against the people who I feel are being discriminated against even today in attaining insurance at a reasonable cost. The one group of people that have continually been vilified and have to pay more are the young fellows starting out on the road, being asked to pay anything from €2,000 to €4,000 when they are starting out on a learner permit with an accompanying driver. That is a savage sum. It is way more than some of them earn in a summer while they are home from college or whatever and trying to work and acquire a full licence to get on the road properly. They are being vilified before they do any harm at all. I believe that every young fellow, boy or girl, should get a chance to get reasonably priced insurance for a start. If they do harm, do wrong or whatever, they should be charged what has to be charged of them then. We have many instances where people may have claimed for flood damage and they cannot get insurance for their homes anymore. We have had such cases in Glenflesk because some entity decided that there could be a once-in-100-years flood that could affect their homes and those people are being denied insurance for their homes. Many parishes, villages and communities try to run annual carnivals and festivals to retain their identity. Sadly, some of them failed to take place this year because they could not get insurance or the insurance premium being asked of them was too much. Even hunting clubs have serious problems in getting any insurance following some claim back a few years ago because there is not enough competition in the market and insurance companies can decide not to cater for that at all. I honestly think that since Quinn left the market there has been a huge void. There has been no real competition and it has been a long time since we heard the kind of competition that he was giving. Sadly, the ordinary punter is suffering. PIAB is changing name and it will now be called the personal injuries resolution board, PIRB. The process may be broadly summarised as follows. The claimant applies to PIAB for compensation. PIAB then informs the respondent, giving them 90 days to agree to the PIAB assessment. If the respondent agrees, they must pay a fee; otherwise, PIAB will authorise the claimant to pursue the claim through the courts. Where PIAB makes an assessment, the claimant has 28 days to decide whether to accept the award. The respondent has 21 days to decide whether to accept the assessment. If the claimant or respondent rejects the assessment, PIAB issues an authorisation for the claimant to pursue the matter through the courts.It would be much better for everyone. Not everyone can agree to PIAB's assessment and, unfortunately, they will have to pursue the legal option. It is only right that that option remains for them. We all wish and hope they would go through the PIRB option now and give it a chance. If they do not accept it, at least they are after trying. It excludes legal costs, the savage legal costs that mount up. We see that in large claims the legal costs nearly equal what the claimant gets. It is an important and valuable option for people who have a claim to go through this system, which is less expensive and will be less expensive for insurance premiums going forward, especially for youngsters who are trying to get insurance.	spk_280

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-10-04	dail	33	Housing for All Update: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_12	County Kerry is not included in the affordable homes scheme, contrary to what the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, told me. The cost of buying a house in Killarney or anywhere around it is between €350,000 and €500,000. On top of that, it is impossible for people who want to build their own homes to get planning permission. Family income supplement is denying people the ability to remain on housing waiting lists because they are being thrown off such lists if they are in receipt of it, having been on those lists for nine or ten years. That is totally unfair in this day and age. People cannot live without the family income supplement, yet are being thrown off the housing list. I want to raise the issue of the cap in County Kerry. It seems it has been raised in other counties, but what is wrong with Kerry? It needs to be increased. We are outside of the Pale, but the cap has to be increased in Kerry because throwing people off the housing list is not doing anything for those who need a home. Single applicants in Killarney are on the list for 14, 15 or 16 years before they get a house. That is the gospel truth. There are no four-bedroom houses in Killarney for applicants and landlords are leaving the market. It is very unfair that people who have been on the housing waiting list for nine or ten years and have three children but are in receipt of family income supplement are thrown off the housing list. I ask the Minister of State to do something about that. It will not cost the Government anything. People have not been allowed to buy a council house since 2015. There are 150 voids in Kerry, including 30 in Killarney, yet the Government will not provide money to put them in order so that they can be rented out.	spk_231
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-10-04	dail	33	Defective Concrete Products Levy: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_13	I thank Sinn Féin for the opportunity to speak on this important motion, which I support. Our group was the only one that did not congratulate the Minister on this levy in the Dáil when it was announced on budget day. This concrete and concrete block levy will add at least €5,000 to the costs for every young man or woman who is trying to build a house. It will also add millions to the cost of the Government's public works and social housing building. The price of concrete products and concrete blocks has already gone up by 30% in the last nine months. The €80 million will be a lot more if the young fellas can continue building one-off houses, for which it is hard to get planning permission in places around Killarney. All types of housing materials have gone up in price. I was amazed that the Minister for Finance and his advisers thought that they were smart by asking where we will get the money to pay for the levy. Is there any fear that we have already paid for it and that we have paid over and above for it? People are being hit by taxes of every creed and description - carbon tax, VAT, income tax, property tax and any other tax the Government can think of. People have to pay up. There are humps on people with lorries and tractors trying to pay the extra VAT and excise duty on the fuel as they try to keep their vehicles going. They have already paid.  There was no regulation in the Twenty-six Counties. We hear that the same quarries that supplied these defective materials also sent materials into the North of Ireland but they were checked there. There was no problem in Derry, when they took their products across the Border.  The Government is giving grants to farmers for buildings and slurry storage on the one hand and then it is increasing the cost of concrete and concrete blocks on the other. That is not fair. What the Government is doing is wrong. It is hurting the ordinary young boys and girls that are trying to put a roof over their heads, which they are entitled to do. Instead of helping them, the Government is hurting them. 	spk_275
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-09-28	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 6: General (Resumed)	dbsect_16	I thank the Ministers for the positive aspects of the budget. We do not have to go through that, to be fair, but I thank them. However, what came over the Ministers to make them introduce a levy on concrete? This is supposed to the Government with the mantra of housing for all. What did it do? It put a 10% levy on concrete blocks when people are trying to fulfil their basic needs by putting a roof over their heads. A grant was allocated for farm buildings for the storage of slurry but then it was taken away by the increase in the cost of concrete. It is absolutely ridiculous. I honestly think that a team of men and women who spent a week in the horrors of drink would not come up with such a ridiculous proposal. I ask the Government to rescind that measure. It is unfair. The Minister promised people on the road who have been paying up to €2.20 per litre for green diesel and petrol that he would do something for them in the budget. He has not done so. Green diesel is €1.30 per litre. Hauliers, farmers and people in industry are all suffering. All the prices for tenders that were put out for public works to build houses will need to be readjusted immediately. There are no Mother Teresas in that industry. The Government will have to pay extra money for those people to build houses. The Government talks about the fuel allowance but still forgets the people in receipt of benefit payments, including those on illness benefits, jobseeker's benefit, maternity benefit, disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit.All those people paid stamps to get that benefit payment and, as I highlighted previously, they will not qualify for fuel allowance. It is totally unfair.	spk_255
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-09-27	dail	33	Budget Statement 2023	dbsect_3	I welcome the chance to talk about this budget. There are a few positive aspects and I welcome them. There are measures for third level students and primary level students but there is nothing whatsoever for secondary students. They have been left out. I welcome the increase for social welfare, for disability payments and for carers but at this juncture I have to say that carers should not be means tested. The devil is in the detail and there is a lot to it. The first thing is the 13.5% VAT rate. The Government wants to bring that back and hit the tourism sector that we value so dearly down in Kerry. We have a wonderful product in Killarney, around the Ring of Kerry and up into north Kerry. There are wonderful places to see but the Government is hitting and kicking people in the sector at this stage. It is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. The thing I am most disappointed about is the people on the road who are paying for petrol and diesel all year. They have been robbed to fund this budget. They have suffered. There is no answer in the world as to how green diesel went from 90 cent up to €1.50 in one jump - in one week. There has been no answer or explanation. This is affecting farmers and people in industry. I have no problem in telling the Ministers that a barrel of crude oil costs less today than it did four years ago. Look at the level of taxation. Is there any shame in the Ministers at all? Just because they are supported by the Greens, they have let them do this to the people of Ireland, the people who elected them continuously over the years. They have forfeited them now for the Green Party.It is ridiculous. The people were looking up to the Government and hoping. We all thought that the Government would do something for the people in this budget but it has done nothing. It promised in June that excise would be reduced by 15 cent, with a 2 cent reduction on green diesel. The Government left that in place until 28 February. Is it going to increase that again then? On health, any amount of money that is given to the HSE will be taken but will not result in a proper health service. It was promised that more beds would open in Tralee and at Kenmare hospital but that has not happened. If elderly people get sick now, they have to queue to get a GP. It is ridiculous. GP services have been extended to youngsters but that will make the queues longer. We are suffering immensely from the lack of a home help service. People are being allocated home help but nobody turns up to give them any help. People are not coming. The Government is accommodating the Ukrainians. Could it not train them and use some of them to administer home help to people? Surely it could. When the Irish went abroad, they had to work everywhere they went. We lack consultants in every sector. We take people to the North on buses for procedures on cataracts, with a bus this weekend and two more buses in the next three weeks. Deputy Michael Collins started this service back in November 2017. We have taken 102 bus loads of people north to date. Some elderly people who cannot hear have to wait for over a year to get hearing tests. I know someone who broke a leg last Saturday. That person is in one of our more prominent hospitals and no plaster has been put on the leg yet. This is Tuesday. One of our group mentioned people with Parkinson's disease earlier. Those people have been let down. We have no nurses for them. With regard to electricity charges, the Government said it will do whatever Europe does. Where is the energy regulator? Where is the Minister in charge of the regulator? We could all agree to paying more for electricity charges if it was true that it cost the companies that much more to generate the electricity. We now hear that their profits have tripled but, at the same time, people are being asked to pay. Why does the Government not stop them right now? They will increase their charges next week and during the rest of next month. Why does the regulator not stop them? They are hurting the people and driving them into the ground. I know of one old woman who is afraid to boil the kettle now because she got such a bill. The Government is saying that it will give people €200 now, €200 after Christmas and €200 more after that. That is not enough. The Government is profiting off the backs of these poor people because it is getting more VAT on it. There is hardly anything for farmers other than a grant for slurry tanks. Most farmers have already bought that kind of equipment. They have built slatted tanks, which are as environmentally-friendly as possible. The Government is doing nothing at all to help with the cost of fertiliser, diesel, electricity, or other materials, spare parts and repairs. The Government is jeopardising food security. The Government said that it would house everyone under Housing for All. Today, it came along and kicked young fellows who are trying to put a roof over their head in the teeth by putting a 10% levy on concrete. Michael Cronin of Coolcaslagh in Killarney and east Kerry has built many social houses and houses for young fellows right around the county.	spk_61

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-09-27	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 1: Mineral Oil Tax	dbsect_6	I, too, want to support the amendment. It is so ridiculous to be seeking to impose the carbon tax with the cost of fuel as it is. The cost of fuel being as it is today is mainly due to the Government taking the most of it in tax already. A barrel of crude oil is cheaper today than it was four years ago.I think of the prices poor people are paying at the pump. They are not paying it for fun. They are paying it to keep their cars going so they can go to work, bring their children to school and do the shopping. Not all of them are living in urban areas. In fact, apart from the towns and villages in Kerry, most of Kerry is very rural and far away from shops, from schools and from anything. If you do not have a car, you are stranded and that is the gospel truth. You cannot get public transport and you cannot even get taxis at night nowadays, never mind during the day. Taxi people have to work in other areas because they are not making a sufficient income from their taxis. Most of them are only helping themselves to keep going with their taxi, which is barely paying the bills, and so that they can have a car. That is what many of them tell me. They are saying the taxi would not be justified at all, but that they have insurance, tax and the fact they have the car go to other work and for other things. They cannot stay out late at night to work because they are not generating enough income. There are not enough taxis to go around and there are no DARTs and there is no Luas. Indeed, there is no public transport, except going from one town to another. There is no public transport like that to help people to go to the rural areas, through the third class roads or the cul-de-sac roads. There is the issue of the hauliers who are transporting the goods. Rural Ireland depends so much on them. To think that any Government or any Minister would seriously think of adding to the cost of fuel today, given what it costs already. Our Rural Independent Group was the only group in this House that voted solidly against the introduction of carbon tax. The carbon tax was to coax people away from using fossil fuels, such as diesel, petrol, etc. God almighty, can the Minister not see that people cannot manage without them? Take the cost of fuel; it has been and still is almost €2 per litre. That is more than €9 per gallon. Take cars in rural areas where they are only in third gear; one cannot get an economical return for those cars. That is what they have and that is what they need. It is not fair of the Government to insist on adding to their woes by insisting on carrying on with the carbon tax and adding it to the cost of the fuel. To clarify, we asked the Government last year to forgo the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, levy. All it is doing now is substituting it. It is doing that now, but it is still insisting on the carbon tax, which is totally unfair. I would expect that when Ministers get into power that they would be fair to the people and to the country they are representing. However, they have been totally unfair with what they are doing with the carbon tax, because fuel is excessively dear as it is. As I said, a barrel of crude oil is cheaper now than it was four years ago. That is a fact, and the Minister can look at the records.	spk_113

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-09-27	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 3: Tobacco Products Tax	dbsect_12	"I am against a tax increase on cigarettes again this year. I would much prefer that more money be spent on education and ensuring our young population does not start smoking. I know smoking is bad for people but I worry about two things when it comes to increasing the tax on cigarettes for people who are addicted.Many of them would tell you that they have no other diversion but smoking their cigarettes at a certain time of the day or night. The price is hurting them. The price of everything has gone up. There is another 50 cent increase this year. People were resigned to the fact that it was going to happen, but I think it was the wrong way to go. It is hurting people who have problems with depression. They treat it as their bit of enjoyment or diversion. More and more people smoke outside their own doors, never mind public places, where they have to go outside anyway. We see people smoking outside their own homes even in secluded places. They may even be the only one in the house. They have retained the habit from public places and they smoke outside. They feel justified after their hard day of work, or whatever disappointment or enjoyment they may have had during the day, and need to smoke the cigarettes. The other thing that I worry about is that young people will find them too expensive and they will go for some other diversion, such as smoking cannabis, which would lead them to taking drugs. That would be much worse than the cigarettes. We know the scourge of drugs and the problems that they create even in rural communities, small country villages and towns. The question people are asked is, ""Do you want a bit of stuff?"" I am sad to see that. We all know that cigarettes are bad and affect people's health, but sadly people got addicted over the years and cannot give them up. I worry that young people may go a different way and find a cheaper alternative in the drugs, which may be more expensive in the long run. Those are my two reasons for opposing the increase on cigarettes."	spk_161
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-09-27	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 4: Special Exemption Orders	dbsect_13	I, too, welcome the late-night exemptions. Many of these businesses have been struggling since the pandemic. It is clear that many places have not come back to the levels of patronage they had. I count this measure as only a small gesture. Much more is needed to help the night-time industry to prosper. Many of my clinics are held in public houses and I appreciate those people affording me a place to meet people. It is more than 20 years since I became a county councillor and started doing clinics.When I go around to the different parishes, it is sad to see that so many pubs have closed. And we wonder why. I often see more people outside a bottle bank now. If you wanted to find a crowd before it would be at the creamery or the post office, but now you would have more of a crowd at a bottle bank at certain times than you would have inside a public house. It is clear to me that people are now more likely to drink in an unregulated manner at home than in regulated conditions where the measure was regulated and the time at which you drink was regulated. It was a much safer environment. It was more regulated than it is now, even after all the talk and ballyhoo. That is where we have finished up with. We will see more closures. It is a sad loss because when the local pub closes, you are also doing away with the culture of our people. It was a great attraction in rural villages and towns. It was where people met people. They had conversations, yarns, story-telling, songs and a bit of music. It attracted a certain type of clientele from other countries and other parts of our own country. It is sad to see the decline of that because I think Ireland will be at a loss. We really should appreciate our own culture because I believe we are different from and better than other peoples in other countries. I have no doubt about it. It is sad to see that a lot of that tradition has been lost and more of it will be lost as pubs close. There are some villages now without any pub where there had been three or four pubs. I will not name any village but there is one in particular that had over 30 pubs and there is no pub open there by day now. I believe many governments have succeeded in closing many of them in many rural places. I think it is a sad reflection on government when that is the truth of what has happened.	spk_172

It rains all day in Kerry and in most of the south west but it is raining on the people of Ireland at present because many of them are struggling to keep going. They live from hand to mouth and they need more assistance from the Government. Whether it is housing or whatever it is - there are many different issues - the money should be spent now. It is the people's money, the taxpayers' money. The Government has decided to take ownership of it and perhaps it will use it for an election slush fund later. I do not know but it is not fair.

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-09-21	dail	33	Energy Security: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am glad to get the opportunity to contribute on this important topic.I have never seen so many people so angry in recent times about what is happening to them and what is being allowed to happen to them by this Government. Electricity charges have trebled in the past 12 months. They have gone up every day since the Lanesboro and Shannonbridge plants were closed and the Government provided no alternative at that time. It was only when they were stuck last year, before the war, that they started buying coal from Russia and got Moneypoint up and running again. Indeed, electricity has gone way up three times or more since the start of the year. Many people, domestic, commercial and retail, cannot afford to pay the bills they are getting now. This includes small shops. I am aware of one small shop run by a man and his wife. Their electricity bill for the two months is up to €7,000 now, when it was less then €2,000. How can those people keep going? This is what is happening. We then hear the Taoiseach saying that he can get the money back from the electricity companies. He can of course because he allowed this to happen all year. The Government is a shareholder in these companies and it is getting dividends from them. He is saying now that he will get the dividends and give them back. It will be too late because he will not give it back directly to the people who paid it. He will not give it back at all to more people. You do not have to be Einstein to know that if electricity companies put up their charges by 300% they are going to have 300% profit, and that consumers will have to pay 300% more. The Government has let this happen all through the year and has stood idly by. Shame on the Government for allowing this to happen and to be promising that it will do something in the budget and maybe give back a couple of hundred euro here and there. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, is the man who wanted one car to service 30 people in a small village. The Minister is not with it at all. The Minister is not in the real world if he thinks that one car would do 30 people in rural Ireland. The Minister wants no turf cutting. The Minister wants no gas burners or oil fires. At the same time the Minister has no alternative provided. I am glad that more turf is being cut this year than for many years and at least the people who have turf secured will be warm for the winter. I believe the Government is suggesting that the people who cut their own turf should make a contribution. I say to the Minister that they will not make any more contribution. They have their contributions made. As far as they are concerned they are self-sufficient now. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Government did not give them any help to save or turn in the turf and they are not entitled to claim any dividends from the cutting or the saving of the turf. When challenged about people being cold for the winter all the Government could say to them was to open their oven doors while they are cooking and that this would warm the house. God Almighty. Why is the Minister insulting so many people like this by advising people to grow vegetables in boxes in south-facing windowsills? Now the Minister and McConalogue are saying that people cannot plough or till the land. People have been tilling the land. It is widely recognised that even with horses and small tractors by tilling the land one will make it more fertile and need to spread less fertiliser. The Government does not want to give people any other option only wind turbines. Wind turbines do not blow all of the year. There are several other types of fuel. There is biofuel to help with road diesel and with tractor diesel. It is the same with petrol engines. We could use the same engines but the Government does not want to hear that. The Government will not entertain these companies. At the same time, a group of people from Ballymakeera were on to me in the past week. The Firebird company workers there are worried that their factory is going to be closed. It employs 160 people. They said that they can add biofuel and work their boilers to take HVO fuel, which includes biofuel, and that there would be no emissions from that. The Minister, however, does not want to listen to things like that. The Government has the daylights frightened out of people. Petrol cars could be converted to LPG gas but the Government does not want to hear about that. This was done back in the day in the 1970s. My late father had a car converted to gas. Today we are demanding no more increases in standing charges. The Government can put legislation in place to ensure this. We call on the Government to give back every cent of the extra money that the Government has robbed from the people and put a cap on the ESB rate to that which applied this time last year. We call on the Government to open up Shannonbridge and Lanesboro immediately and to allow micro-energy companies to develop solar and water turbines. Many people are already producing extra electricity and they cannot get credit for it. Much more could be generated. We call on the Government to bring down the extra duty and taxes on road diesel and tractor diesel. The Government gave them back nothing. Home heating oil and petrol must be capped at the price being charged back in 2021.	spk_21

The Government has a 90% share in ESB. The Minister states the way to go is electric. Is the Government to let this continue? Where is the energy regulator? Has the Government any control over what is happening? Is this to be allowed continue? The Government says it will get it back. Why did the Government let them take it in the first place? I can honestly tell the Government that there are old women now afraid to boil the kettle. Traditionally, in rural Ireland, the kettle was always at the ready to make a sup of tea for the people but the facts are that old people are afraid to boil the kettle now because they are seeing the bills that they are getting and they are absolutely terrified. I am asking the Minister whether the Government has any control over what is happening.	spk_201
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-09-21	dail	33	Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_17	I reiterate what I have said previously about electric cars. I have nothing against electric cars but it is a fact people will buy electric cars when they are reliable and when they are a real alternative to what we have at present. People cannot be forced out of good diesel cars that can travel the distance, let us say from Kerry to Dublin, without having to refuel. I can actually go back home again, just about, without refuelling, but if that was an electric car, there is no way in the world that I would make it up here in one day, given the length of time it takes to charge cars the distance they would go. I will say for the benefit of whoever is listening that one of my cars has 750,000 km done. It is a diesel car and it is going perfectly. It is 16 years old. Will the Minister tell me what electric car will travel that distance? What account of the electric car will there be after two or three years? What will it be worth and where will you go with it because you cannot dispose of the battery without paying an enormous sum for it? No scrap dealer will take an electric car for scrap because he or she must pay too much to dispose of the battery. To get back to the crunch of the issue, if we added all these electric cars now coming up to Christmas and the worry that we have with providing electricity for the utilities it is needed for at present, where would they be? Would they be all parked along the M50, N7 or whatever it is, having given up because there would be no electricity to keep them going? We must be realistic. As for forcing people, the Minister has this idea, and his party and the people who support him are saying, that people should not be allowed to buy diesel and petrol cars. That is democratically wrong. Let people make up their mind, and when the electric car is a reliable and useful option, they will buy them without being forced to buy them. They should not be forced to do that. The Minister seems to be electric mad and for nothing else, but there are other options out there. There are biofuel options. I have been told - my group met with these biofuel groups - that the Government would not listen to them. If that biofuel was added to the diesel, there would be no emissions. The Government does not want to listen to that. People are stressed and they cannot buy new cars. The Minister told them to buy diesel cars in 2007 and now he is telling them they must get rid of them and buy electric cars. What will the Minister think of in a couple of years' time? That is the worry. There are options. Take the petrol car, for example. In 1975, my father had a petrol car. Its registration number was 236 PRI. It was converted to gas. The same crowd, the liquid petroleum gas, LPG, crowd, came into us. They say that if that type of gas was used in the petrol cars again, it would reduce the emissions to practically nil. They also told us the Government would not meet with them, the same as the biofuel people. What connection has the Government that it does not want to listen to any other option? There is no harm in getting down emissions, and I have nothing against electric cars, but they are not a viable, realistic or affordable option right now. Everyone here knows how much people are caught up short of money for everything with the cost of everything gone up. Do we want to exacerbate the problem by telling them it is a matter of keeping what they have for the foreseeable future? Maybe the Government wants them to get out and walk. The Minister suggested that one car would do 30 people in a village. I can assure him that three people in Kilgarvan village would not manage with one car. Everyone needs the car they have and they will not give it to anyone else because they need it. You cannot go anywhere in rural Ireland without a car. It is fine here, as there are brand new shiny buses the Government is putting the carbon tax it collects into and which the people in rural Ireland are paying for, but the Minister has to be realistic. The electric car will be bought when it is a reliable, affordable and realistic option. Right now, it is not and forcing people to do just that is wrong. To top it all, the Government does not have the infrastructure. I did not hear of any extra charging points being placed along filling stations or anywhere. In Kerry, they cannot afford to do it and they are getting no help from the Government. The Government will have to wake up. The Minister will have to be real. People have to get up in the morning and they must have something reliable to take them to work. If they are travelling long distances, an electric car will not do that. It will suit some housewives and people doing short runs but at present the design is not good enough to take them on long journeys. Until that happens, the Minister is wasting his time, and everyone else's time as well, and he is hurting and making more angry the people in rural Ireland.	spk_304

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-09-21	dail	33	Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_17	I am flabbergasted and do not know where to start. When someone who is elected by the people comes in here, having got enough votes, those people are depending on the person to do the right thing. For someone to come in here and try to use his influence to obliterate the rights and proposals put in place by a local authority that has arrived at something collectively - there are 33 councillors elected to Kerry County Council. To think that someone in this Chamber, or a group of people, would try to deny them what they had put together over hours and days, together with management. Think of all they do together. I must remind those present councillors hardly get paid anything for their time save expenses and mileage. To think we would try to take all the powers they have and entrust it to An Bord Pleanála. We know what An Bord Pleanála has been at in recent times and indeed in times long ago. It has not acted fairly and squarely much of the time. As for suggesting the taking of powers away from local authorities, given some of the things that are here by way of amendments, I am glad the Minister is not accepting them. It looks to me as if any proposed road development or scheme would not be accepted or allowed to go ahead if it was to help cars or vehicles that were not electrically operated or if it was not for walking or cycling. God almighty, man alive, what kind of a mind would put this kind of a story together? It would mean we could not remove a shrub or a tree to give vision around a turn on a narrow road where there might be a good bit of traffic and it is dangerous to travel, even for school buses or vehicles bringing materials or feed to farmers. For someone to think they could blindfold us here and make us vote for something like that and put it through the Dáil, who the bloody hell does the Deputy think he is to try to do this to the people of Ireland or to the people of Kerry we are representing? We would not be able to widen a turn, remove a bend or straighten a bit of a road where there are accidents day after day unless the people were driving an electrically-operated car or bicycle. I will tell the Deputy so much about two electric bicycles anyway, seeing as it came up here. I have a man across the road from me. He bought two electric bicycles. He paid €1,700 for them over a year ago. The two of them are broken down now and they want two new batteries. He will have to give over €500 for the batteries for these bicycles. That is God's gospel truth; I am not making it up. I meet him every day when I am at home. He is my next-door neighbour. This is the kind of a mind that is here telling us we will not be able to widen a road unless it is for walking, cycling, use by electric vehicles or public transport.There is no thought about the man or woman who is getting up this morning and leaving some rural place like Gneevgullia, Scartaglin or Brosna and trying to make his or her way maybe down miles of narrow roads to get on to the N72 or the N22 which will take them to Cork, Mallow or wherever. There is no thought about those people at all only trying to deny them the right of widening a road. God help us. Where are we with the Killarney bypass? It is no wonder this is going on since 2004. We were told it was to go ahead and that tenders would be put out in a couple of years but it is backwards it has gone now in the last two or three years since this Government got into power. It is no wonder because with roads that were sanctioned we see the Minister himself trying to block them in Limerick and other places. The Killarney bypass is vital because the town is choked because of the lack of it. God only knows when that will go ahead if he remains in power. I can see that the Government has gone frantic at the present time. They know what we are hearing, that they are finished after this term and they are trying to rush through everything drastic and any kind of proposal at all they get in their head here knowing they are finished - I do not know who will be elected next time. I may not be elected myself. There is one thing sure - the Green Party candidates will not be elected, not in rural Ireland anyway, I can guarantee it. They will not be elected by the people of rural Ireland. They would want to be fairer with their ideas if there are certain things they want to get through here. What they are proposing at the present time is absolutely ridiculous, trying to force people so they cannot be allowed to widen roads or straighten bends and that they must buy electric cars after 2030. The Government must get real because it is not real at the present time.	spk_328
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-09-20	dail	33	National Retrofit Plan: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_10	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this important matter. It has been the Government's mantra that the carbon tax it is collecting is going into deep retrofitting. As the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, who is present, has been told here all evening, there is a wait of up to two years. What is happening to the money the Government is collecting from hard-beaten motorists, whether they are lorry drivers or tractor drivers or whoever? They are playing carbon tax at an exorbitant rate and the Government is going to charge them more in the budget. Where is the money going? Up to 300 people were on the waiting list in County Kerry at the end of February. That number has doubled since then. As for Kerry County Council, we do not know why the voids are not being brought back into use. We are kind of being told that it is because the voids must all be deep retrofitted, at a cost of up to €60,000 or €70,000, but the Government is not providing the money to the local authority to bring back the voids. There are 150 of them at present. I am asking the Minister to direct the money the local authority needs to retrofit the houses. There are 30 such houses vacant in Killarney while people all around are crying to get housed. The Government is talking about putting heat pumps into old houses. Some of the houses are not fit for that. In the case of grant aid for the elderly, in Kerry a person will only get €3,200 to repair a roof. That includes the VAT, so it is only about €2,192 that the person gets. I am asking the Minister to increase that money. If there is rain pouring down, what good is heating the house? We have to start with the roof and keep the water out.	spk_323

I have raised this several times already this year. People are being approved but still there is no home help arriving. It is a natural desire for elderly people to want to stay in their homes. Elderly people in places such as Killarney, Rathmore, Headfort, Kilcummin, Curragh, Castleisland and Killorglin are waiting for extra hours and some of them that do not have any home help at all are waiting for the home help to materialise. They are finding they have to go into hospital more often and it is a disaster. I ask the Tánaiste what is happening. I have been promised by the Taoiseach that it was being sorted out. It is still not sorted out. Is the Government paying the home helpers enough? Is it covering the extra costs for travelling out to houses?

These tribunals will have to be banned completely and gotten rid of because they are costing the State millions and maybe billions. There is no law that is being meted out to the people who have done wrong back over the years. The people to whom they have done the most wrong are the taxpayers, the hard-working people around the country who are out in the dark in the morning, who do not come home until after dark at night and who are paying savage amounts of tax. We hear that this tribunal or investigation will cost €100 million to go after the figure of €8 million, which is ridiculous, as previous speakers said. If that was a business, a company, a businessman or any single entity, they would not go after it like that. I am saying to the Minister of State that this should be delegated to An Garda Síochána. There should be a special unit in An Garda Síochána to deal with this kind of carry on because there is much too much of it. Denis O’Brien’s name was mentioned. He was totally cleared and exonerated from any wrongdoing. I do not know who initiated this investigation, but this kind of carry on will have to stop, because the taxpayer is paying for every inch of it.There are treasonable offences going on. There must be someone to look after the Government because it has a write-down as well. Irish Sugar was sold and at the same time a factory was erected over in Bulgaria. I was told today that one of the power plants in the midlands that was closed down has been put up in Poland. To think that the people here are on the road every day now trying to pay multiples of what it is worth for diesel and petrol. The extra tax is going into the coffers of the Government.	spk_289

The first thing the Government did was to close down Bord na Móna. The price of electricity has gone up every day since. Everyone driving on the roads is being robbed by the tax content in the cost of fuel. Four energy providers have left the market this week. There will be no competition and ESB bills are going to be dearer. It looks like 150 social houses in County Kerry will remain vacant because there is no funding for voids to turn them around because the Minister wants them to be retrofitted to the highest standard. There are 150 houses vacant. The former Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, stopped the drilling in 2019. The gas fields of Kerry, the Corrib and Kinsale could be probed further. Some 200 million barrels of gas and oil could be drilled out of Barryroe. The Government pays no heed to that. It refused, point blank, planning permission for Shannon LNG and the Minister is against it. That is criminal. People on the road are paying the amount of tax they are paying and then the Minister suggests that one car would do everyone in a village. Yet, he and his party members and Ministers fly first-class and peer down on the lot of us. That is what this Government is about. If it were any other jurisdiction, its members would be tried for high treason because the people in the country are highly regarded.	spk_335

We certainly did not get time to deal with all these extra amendments. I am sure they will adversely affect many people who are trying to create employment. Ramming this through without any proper scrutiny reflects poorly on the Minister of State. Deputies are being denied the right to properly scrutinise what will be voted on here later. It is being rammed through by the Government and that is totally and absolutely wrong. One of the things that worries me is the denial of a right to judicial review. No one took a judicial review lightly because they are very costly but the option was there. It worries me that the Government is going to deny certain people the right to seek a judicial review. I am also very worried about the utterances of the Planning Regulator with regard to the county development plan passed in Kerry. The broad view of the councillors when discussing the plan was that people in Kerry did not want turbines close to their houses. I am worried that this Bill will in some way override the view and voted policy of Kerry County Council with regard to planning for wind turbines. It was the council's view that Kerry has more than its fair share of turbines and that there was nowhere left for them that was not close to houses.	spk_32

I appreciate that everyone is trying to do their best but, sadly, I see in this proposal a lot of nonsense that just will not work. The Bill does not state whether it is referring to local authorities or otherwise. In my view, the local authorities assess income and treat people on lower incomes accordingly. Those people pay less rent. Those who tabled the Bill must be referring to private landlords. To add to what the previous speaker said, many landlords pay 52% tax, and maybe something could be done about that to ensure that landlords will stay in the market and continue providing housing. I suppose the Government has a role in this. It could give more money to the local authorities to purchase more land and build more houses in places like Gneevgullia and Rathmore, for instance. The Government, however, is now putting on pressure to ensure that Airbnb is ruled out of order. There is a reason landlords opt for that market, and that is that they have control over their houses. I deal with many people looking for houses to rent. I also know many decent landlords who want to get out of the market but cannot do so because the Residential Tenancies Board is more in tenants' favour and will not allow landlords to get out. Many tenants are staying on in their houses and refusing to go even though they have been given proper notice. That is why landlords are getting out of the market. They do not have control of their houses. The Government needs to do something about that if it thinks private landlords are going to stay in the market.	spk_63

I fear it is going to adversely affect businesspeople, people who create jobs and people who pay their taxes and even pay for the likes of us in here. They contribute to the State's coffers in a big way. This Bill being rushed through like this will be at the expense of many hard-working people who are trying to do their best, create jobs and provide infrastructure. They will be denied such by the rushing through of this Bill. I can see this is going to override county councillors and local authorities.Having been a member of a local authority for many years and having dealt with a number of county development plans, I know the work that councillors and directors of services do. Joined together at every time in our history, they came up with county development plans for their county. They have accrued knowledge and experience from a lifetime working for and with people. They know their areas and the needs of the people. We must consider the people of today who are creating jobs and employing people. Those are the people we must respect and for whom we must try to do our best. The Government has been in office for two years and it has green all over it. There has been talk of doing this and that for years, green energy and so forth. How is it that the Government could not get the Bill right without the need to throw in so many amendments at the last minute? Why could the Government not put its work together and have it ready? It was unable to get it ready in the first place. We are now past Second Stage. Surely this Bill should have been tied up properly and not rushed through the Chamber at the last minute. The elected Members have been given no proper chance to scrutinise it or get consensus that what we are doing is right. Now we know for sure what we are doing is wrong because it has been expedited so much. We are giving power to An Bord Pleanála to override local authorities and giving power to the Planning Regulator. Does anyone know if he has ever been to Kerry? Has he ever been to the west? Where is he from? Does he know the areas we are representing? I do not know if the Minister of State knows the planning regulator but I certainly do not. I do not depend on him and I do not depend on An Bord Pleanála.  I too have experience of local young fellows who have got planning permission in sensitive areas. I know of one farm of 365 acres that was in a special area of conservation, SAC. The local authority, in its wisdom, granted the young fellow permission to be near his ageing parents and allowed him to build a house on the 365 acres. That application was challenged by An Taisce and sent to An Bord Pleanála. An inspector came down and agreed with the grant of permission but other members of the board refused it. The man in question is now living 20 miles away from his elderly mother, who is living alone. His father has died and he was the only one who was able to drive. The son is in and out of the place every day but cannot live there with his family because he was denied that right by An Taisce, which is supposedly composed of good people. That is what they did to this poor couple. The same thing has happened in several other instances. I will leave it at that with respect to what An Taisce has done. This Bill regulates substitute consent procedures.	spk_405

Kerry County Council, in its wisdom, granted permission. The inspector came down and agreed with that decision. However, the application went back to An Bord Pleanála and was refused. That is where the matter lies. I am sorry that is the case because the people involved are good and hard-working. This is what An Taisce did to them. I do not agree with An Taisce and will never stand with it when it hurts people like that. The people it hurts are human beings. I will never forgive An Taisce for that while there is blood running through my veins. This Bill amends the Planning and Development Act 2000 to regulate substitute consent procedures for applications regularising existing developments and requiring retrospective environmental impact assessments. It will provide for a single-stage application process. It allows for simultaneous applications for any future development to An Bord Pleanála. These are all going to be referred to An Bord Pleanála, along with substitute consent for all developments. It also allows for the refusal to consider applications for retention of unauthorised developments in certain cases. That is wrong. If we do not allow an applicant the right to due process, it is undemocratic. It is unfair for someone who may be employing people and delivering infrastructure to communities. It would be unfair for someone to be deprived. Who would decide? Is it An Bord Pleanála? Is it the regulator? That is of concern to me. Who is going to make that decision? It is clearly not going to be the local authorities or county councillors. Who is going to make the decision? Will it be some unelected official, as Deputy Mattie McGrath said, in a mansion of an office somewhere but nobody knows where and nobody knows the person or people making the decisions? I will move on to consider offshore wind turbines and maritime planning. I know the Government is rolling out offshore wind projects on the eastern side of the country. I am far away from those people but I know they are very concerned about what is happening off the coast of Wicklow and Dublin. They have issues and they have not been and will not be heard. This Bill will be rammed through and those people will not be allowed a say. No one will hear their concerns. It will be much the same off the west coast of Kerry where issues also arise. I am not much of a fisherman and I do not know much about the sea but I do know that in all cases, trawlers, boats and fishermen have certain routes through the bay or the ocean because there are impediments of one kind or another. They have their routes in the same way as the planes in the sky have theirs. There is one route and that is the route they have to use for safety and many other reasons. I hope those people will not be infringed upon because they have been hurt enough already. The Bill also deals with RPZs and Airbnb. It seems to me and many other people that the Government thinks those measures will sort out the housing problem. I can tell the Minister of State that he has no hope in the world in that regard. People who do short-term lets will never do long-term lets. They have their reasons. If they have to, they will give it up, and most likely they will. The Government will certainly not benefit from those houses. There are other Members here shouting for that and looking to end short-term lettings. It will not affect or help the people who are on housing lists. It will hurt people in rural areas of Kerry, such as Killarney, which was declared an RPZ by a Deputy in this Chamber.It was meant to be for Killarney town but it has been brought out to a large part of east Kerry where people used to let their second house, maybe the old family house that they did up on the farm, and derived a little bit of income from it for perhaps three or four months of the summer. Kerry is a lovely place today and in fine weather, but it is not so attractive to tourists in the winter when it is rainy and places are not green any more. Short-term lets were attracting a certain type of tourists to rural places. The local pubs, shops and whatever else in the local village benefited from a few extra people being around for the few months. If Deputies are going to stop short-term lettings, and there are other Deputies here who will vote against it, I can guarantee that these people will not rent their houses long term. They have no notion of doing it, never did it and will not do it in the future. The Government is wasting a lot of time with this effort. The way to help people who are on the housing list, as Lemass and de Valera did back in 1960s or whenever, is to build social and council houses. People were housed then and they also built rural cottages. The local authorities gave out demountable homes but are stopped from doing that now. Unless there is a fire or a flood, the local authority will not bring out a demountable home. However, they used to before. If a house fell down or the roof fell in now and it was so bad that there were no windows or doors in it, they will not bring out a demountable home now. Rather, they will try to force the person into some rented accommodation in the nearest town or village and there might not be a town or village anywhere near the person. I know of one person who died in his van. I am sad about that because I raised it with the Minister of State. I thank him for coming back to me about it. I will be fair to every man and woman. The Minister of State did come back to me on that. However, the man has died since, so I will not be on about him any more. He died in a van because we could not get a demountable home out to him. If the local authority wishes to bring one out, it has to look for planning permission and do so many other things that it would take 12 months. It used to be called emergency housing, but it is not emergency housing any more.  I hear that some other kind of houses can now be built and the Government wants to build a lot of them for other types of people in bigger towns or cities with no problem and without any planning permission. I do not think that is fair. I am very concerned that we are wasting time getting rid of Airbnb and other short-term lets because it will not help the housing situation one iota.	spk_409

I hope I can add to its call to help. The Government's focus at present seems to be totally on Airbnb. The Government thinks that will sort out the issue. There are people who want to let their houses short-term and they will not let them long-term. The Government cannot make them do otherwise with any law it brings in. The fact that in our local authority last October we had 162 vacant houses, many of which have not been brought up to the standard at which they can be allocated, says something. The Government needs to do something about that. It needs to give the local authorities adequate funding to bring such houses back to the standard it is asking the local authorities to bring them to. Today I was told about a Kerry local authority house still vacant after four and a half years in the heart of Killarney, with briars growing in around the windows and the doors. I got a call about it because there are now vermin perching there and threatening the people next door. Householders and landlords want to get out of letting properties. Why? That is the big question. There is a reason, and the Government has to suss it out because many of them are getting out. The Government cannot make them stay because they have problems. As for planning permission in the Killarney electoral area, where people want to build homes themselves and put a roof over their heads, half the total area of the electoral area is sterilised on one side by the national park, where people cannot build, coming out onto the national secondary roads from Rathmore to Killarney to Killorglin, and from the county bounds into Killarney. We are waiting for a bypass for Killarney. All that land is sterilised from Farranfore through the heart of Kilcummin. People just cannot get planning permission to put a roof over their heads.	spk_622

In particular, I wish to highlight the plight of the Kerry Parents and Friends Association, which is based in the Old Monastery in Killarney and which is run by Ms Marie Linehan. I pay tribute to Mr. Tony Darmody, who gave so much of his time to the organisation over the years. I am asking for the immediate publication of the action plan on the disability capacity review and its inclusion in budget 2023 to ensure that another year does not pass with families and individuals left without any indication of when or how the urgent needs that they are experiencing will be met. An accessible disability budget must be announced in order that individuals with disabilities and their families can understand how many existing and new residential supports, day-care places and respite supports will be provided for in budget 2023, and how this relates to the needs set out in the capacity review. The Kerry Parents and Friends Association is classed as a section 39 organisation. It receives a lot less funding for the organisation and its workers than it would if it were a section 38 organisation, even though it is doing the same work. The association is helping people with disabilities in places like Gneeves, Gullane and Faha whose parents are now in their 70s and 80s. If it were not for this wonderful association, these people would be completely lost. I ask the Minister of State to publish the action plan on the capacity review as soon as possible, so that people know where they are at.	spk_38

That is the way we should be from here on. I hear the leader of the Minister's party saying we should have a debate, that the world is changing and we should change. If we are to change our stance on neutrality, it must be the people of Ireland who make that decision. It must be a referendum. The people of the country are entitled to that. If the Government wants to change that, it will have to allow a referendum. I do not believe the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste are entitled to make that decision for us.

We read that EU law precludes national legislative measures which provide, as a preventative measure, for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data relating to electronic communications to combat serious crime. What we are really talking about here is the Graham Dwyer case. He was convicted in this country with all the means, and I believe rightfully, that the Garda used. We must ensure that the Garda will be able to do its job into the future to convict murderers, drug lords and serious villains, and ensure that we assist the Garda in every way we can as legislators. There is the problem, however, of seeking to retain data from innocent people. I have a serious problem with one matter. People come to me every day who are seeking to renew their driver licence. They are asked for their public services card number. Many elderly people do not have that number. When they go to renew their licence after ten years they might have to travel long distances to Tralee to do so. Then they are asked for their public services card number. I do not see the need for that when the service already has a personal public service, PPS, number and a date of birth and the people were already licensed. I do not know why anyone needs those data. We were told in the Dáil that this was actually illegal, and we had some type of agreement or understanding passed in the House that the card was not necessary for such things. The people who operate this service are in a private company that won a tender from the State. They are operating this service and we do not know what they are doing with those data or why they should have them. They already have a PPS number, the date of birth and the old licence number, so I cannot understand what that is about. What I want to get across here is that we must do everything we can to ensure that whatever avenues are available to the Garda are utilised to the utmost to ensure the conviction of somebody like Graham Dwyer. We applaud the Garda for bringing him to justice for what he did to a lady who was doing no harm to anybody. At the same time, we must have a distinct difference. I cannot understand why we need to retain data in many other instances involving innocent people. This Bill is being rushed and we need more discussion. I am amazed that many of the Government speaking slots were not taken up in this debate. We appreciate that the Minister is here, but there were other speakers from the Government parties and they have not shown up at all. We need to have a full debate on the totality of this. It is very serious and necessary on one point to deal with the likes of Graham Dwyer, but it must be fair and avoid the unnecessary retention of data concerning innocent people.	spk_160
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-07-05	dail	33	Back to School Costs: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_17	I thank Deputy Ó Laoghaire and Sinn Féin for bringing this important motion before us. It is very timely in light of the fact that the Dáil will be rising in a week's time and we will not be back before the children go back to school in September. We appreciate that the Government has made some announcements in recent hours, but we have to drive home to the Minister that parents face a summer of dread as they struggle to deal with primary and secondary school charges of up to €1,500 to send their little ones back to school. Radical reform of the current back-to-school allowance is needed to deal with these costs. The €58 million back-to-school allowance scheme needs to be seriously expanded to cover additional charges placed on parents to ensure more people qualify. Payments should also issue much more rapidly. With the phenomenal rise in the cost of living and the rise in the use of food banks, a similar expansion of the school meals programme to proactively deal with food poverty is also needed. I know from the feedback I get from secondary schools that many children are coming to school hungry. We need to recognise that fact because there has been a lot of talk about food security but surely at the present time, we have enough food for everyone. This problem needs to get recognition and needs to be addressed. We all know that the cost of schoolbooks, tablets, school uniforms, tracksuits and school shoes poses crippling expenses for families.Some schools require very expensive uniforms. In these times of financial strain for families, this kind of set-up should be stopped. An ordinary jumper and pants should be acceptable rather than a school placing parents under this massive cost burden. Books that were acceptable for the same class last year should be acceptable this year and it should be possible to hand them down.  Children may love finishing school every June but many parents dread it because it is at this time of the year that they must start paying for their return in September. I will mention some of the costs parents face. Schoolbooks cost an average of €210 per child. I have been asking about this. Extracurricular activities cost €178. Gym and sports equipment costs €77 and can go up to €120 at secondary school level. I could talk for a long time but I must give fair play to my colleagues.	spk_181
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-06-29	dail	33	Autism Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this important Bill. We all know young couples for whom it is a very tough cross to bear when they find out their child has a problem. It certainly places strain on them because they want the best for their child or, in some cases, children. The situation is no different in Kerry. We have our share of families that include children with autism. Parents are looking for assessments and placements and they see their child is being neglected. The first point to make is that we should try to determine, as I have asked before of the Government, what is causing the increasing levels of autism in children. The numbers affected seems to be ever increasing. We are told that one in every 65 children presents with autism. I feel the number is much higher than that from the level of representations my office is getting daily. More than 4,000 children are on waiting lists for autism assessment. That is dreadful. I am not blaming anyone in particular for this. The problem was there under previous Governments but it is increasing now and we must deal with it. It is truly shocking that in 2022, children with disabilities are not being looked after properly. The current waiting time for an autism assessment is between two and three years. Many parents are worried this will leave it too late for their child to be assessed and get the interventions that are needed. An incidence rate of one in 65 surely says there should be a special needs assistant in more schools, including one- and two-teacher schools. Many families have to go down the route of private assessment. We know how much stress families are under with the cost of everything today, including the cost of fuel to go to work. Parents often have to pay anything from €950 to €1,500 for a private assessment. It is safe to say that parents who can afford such an assessment have access to services sooner and, therefore, obtain better outcomes for their children. What about the parents who do not have €950 to €1,500? They feel their child is being denied the right to fair play. I welcome the Bill and this debate. We need to see a sea change in how autism services are delivered and we need to see tangible results. We have our share of families in this situation in Kerry. An enormous number of parents are presenting who feel their child has autism. The first thing they are not getting is an assessment, which is taking two to three years to access. I know the Minister of State is listening. It is hard to stand up here when one only has a couple of minutes and can see the Minister is not listening. I see she is listening and I appreciate that. I hope she will take all our words back to the Cabinet table and make sure something positive comes out of this debate. That is what we are asking. We are depending on her. It is her time to act, as Minister of State with responsibility for this area, alongside the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. We appreciate that. Will she please do something for these children? It is their time as well and they only get one cut at it. We need to help them at the earliest possible stage in their development and ensure they get the assistance they require from the State and the education system.	spk_40
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-06-29	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_10	I am glad to get the opportunity to raise the issue of the cost of fuel, which is impacting on everyone on the road, whether it is the man going to work in the car, the mother taking children to school or the man filling up his lorry to transport goods or filling a construction work vehicle. Kerry is far away from everywhere and is impacted more than many other places. The increase in the cost of fuel is massive. The pumps along the road tell the story, with prices at €2.15 or €2.20 a litre. People are at their wits' end trying to stay on the road. Work is slowing. People building new houses and even those building one-off houses are pausing and wondering what they will do. Farmers are paying €1.60 or €1.70 a litre for green diesel. Bus operators are tied into contracts. There is a problem with taxis at night; they are just not operating because it is not worth their while. We see where trawlers are parking up. One transport company, close to the Minister in Cork, is parked up this week. The Government is taking almost double in tax now from fuel than it did 12 months ago. Surely it is time to give back some of the extra tax it has taken to the people on the road? They need it to stay going and October is too far away. There is talk of mini-budgets and emergency budgets but the Minister has said the normal budget time is when it will be dealt with. These are not normal times. People are paying to try to stay on the road and fill their cars or other vehicles. They are not paying normal prices now. The Government must keep work going and this is the time to intervene. We recognise that the Government gave back 15 cent or 20 cent per litre on fuel a couple of months ago but that is not enough now. Fuel prices have gone way up again and it is now time to intervene and ensure that work stays going. The Government will reap the dividends if work continues anyway but if it stops, the Government will not even get core taxes because people will not be on the road. They cannot stay going and that is the honest truth. The Government is not aware of how serious the matter is and how people are suffering. People must travel on long journeys to work from Kerry and they are paying massively to fill their cars and try to stay going. These are not normal times and in rural Kerry people cannot travel without a car or some type of vehicle. They are paying more and suffering more. I am asking the Minister to act now and give them back a sizeable amount of the extra tax the Government has taken.	spk_65

I accept and acknowledge what the Government has provided already but it is just not enough. The Minister must admit that the Exchequer has taken in a massive increase in taxation. In the past two weeks alone, fuel prices have increased by 20%. That is coming out of people's pockets. They are on the road and trying to pay for the fuel. I recognise what the Minister said about hauliers but to qualify for that scheme, one must have a haulage licence. Hauliers who are just supplying goods for themselves do not have a haulage licence and they are not benefiting. Again I say there are people travelling long distances going to work, putting petrol and diesel in their cars, and the Government will have to do more for them. They cannot wait until the budget. The Minister only gave farmers 2 cent off the price of green diesel. God almighty, it is €1.60 and €1.70 per litre today. They are trying to keep going and provide fodder and food for people all over the country. The Government must do something for them. The Minister talks about addressing this in the budget but it must address the kernel of the problem now, which is the extra tax being taken by the Government. There is wriggle room to do something for these people. I am begging the Minister to do something for those people.	spk_67

I am very grateful. Regarding the Special Criminal Court, I would much prefer we had trial by jury but I will not be the one to compromise the Garda if it wants to bring to justice druglords and criminal gangs. If the only way to deal with them is the Special Criminal Court, so be it. They have to be dealt with because our towns and villages are ravaged by drugs. The usual story now is that someone will walk up to you, not knowing you at all, and ask you if you want a bit of stuff. That is what is going on in all our towns and villages, even in the most rural parts of Kerry. They must be rooted out and the issue must be dealt with because our youth are being destroyed. I wish to raise another, more local issue, a new Circuit Court house for Tralee. We need to agree a site. Urgent discussions should take place now between all the interested parties: the Department of Justice, solicitors, businesspeople, members of the community and whoever else. There are different sites, including Ballymullen Barracks, that need to be considered. It must be ensured that this courthouse is included in the imminent investment programme for public buildings. Otherwise, another opportunity may not arise for years, which in effect would mean, as is happening at the moment, that the Circuit Court would be lost to Tralee forever and finish up in Limerick or elsewhere.That is not good enough for the massive county of Kerry. We need our Circuit Court operating in a proper building with modern infrastructure and to ensure it is in place for all those who need to use it. Another request has been asked of me and I will ask it very briefly. Two Kerrymen have died, one in Garda custody. One was from Fenit, Shane Lynch, who died in Limerick, and the other, whose name was John O’Driscoll, died in Wexford. This happened weeks ago and their families are asking for clarity as to what happened. I know an investigation is taking place and we all want fair play but these families just want clarification as to what happened to these two Kerrymen in other counties.	spk_134

This is a Bill to try to ensure we do not have blackouts. The Government has paid €450 million for gas generators but where will it get the gas? It could get cornered with that because the Ministers do not want to listen to anybody. We have an opportunity in Kerry and a very worthwhile company has had a proposal in the offing for many years at Shannon LNG, where we could source gas and bring in the gas from western countries that might be inclined to sell it to us rather than dealing with Putin and others. We are in trouble with Brexit and Britain's Prime Minister Johnson as well. Deputy Micheál Martin is now the Taoiseach and went around north Kerry canvassing with Councillor Norma Moriarty when he promised the people of north Kerry he would support Shannon LNG. What has he done? He allowed his Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to object and put in a submission against it. We had our own gas and people went drilling off the coast of Kerry. Of course, the Tánaiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, stopped that. We had a proposal in the Chamber a few weeks ago involving Barryroe but that was shot down, despite the possibility of any amount of oil and gas being there. There has been much talk here today about data centres but we should strive to put people in households, homes and business before the data centres, please. That is all I will say about them because much has been said about them. There has been much talk about turf. We have it and it is our own but there is now a war in Europe that is threatening to be the third world war. What have we done only closed Bord na Móna when we had the possibility of generating our own electricity. Every day since it closed, the cost of electricity has increased. Everybody in the country knows that. Everybody we ask, whether in homes or business, will say the cost of electricity has increased every day since Bord na Móna closed. We cut our own turf and there has been much talk about turf. We have had seven generations cutting turf; I was the sixth generation and my daughter and sons are at it now. We will make no apologies to anyone for cutting the bit of turf and keeping our homes warm. We are proud to do that. The people before us did it and it is part of our culture. There are many other people like us who will continue to do it. If we closed the entire country, the difference would amount of 0.013% of global emissions. We can see that Germany, China, Poland and many others have gone back to coal. There is much talk about turf but no word about planes. People need planes but we need a discussion about them. There were 200,000 people flying out of the country last weekend. We must have planes but the Government's focus seems to be on turf. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has gladly ensured more people are now cutting turf. I know somebody who has spent €35,000 or €40,000 on solar panels but gets nothing back for what they supply to the grid. I know several others who are contemplating getting panels but they cannot get going because there is no assistance. The Government is two years in office now and all it will be remembered for is increasing the carbon tax. We have several methods of creating alternative energy. We are blessed with so many rivers. Kenmare was electrified by the O'Sheas back in the 1930 when they set up turbines in the Sheen river. It was the same with the Sweeneys, the gifted family in Shandrum in Kilgarvan, who generated their own electricity. The Government gives no consideration to such people now.	spk_252

I thank Sinn Féin for this motion to give us the opportunity to talk about these very important matters. Everyone understands the rise in the cost of living is caused by the cost of fuel. The men and women on the road are suffering, whether it is driving a car or a lorry, and the farmers driving tractors and jeeps are all suffering because of the extra cost of fuel. Whatever about the budget, and you can put whatever name you like on it, I am calling on the Minister to help these people. The Government is taking in way more tax now than it was at the time of the budget last year, when fuel was around €1.20 per litre for diesel or petrol. It is nearly double that now, so the Government has nearly doubled the tax take. I ask the Government to give it back to the people on the road who are suffering. In a way, the Government will ensure costs for everything else are kept down rather than rising. People just cannot keep going. The wheels will grind to a halt. Whether it is the lorry and tractor men, men and women going to work or mothers taking their children to school, and we do not have school transport in every part of our rural areas, they are all suffering and they are the most entitled to get the money back. They are the people who are paying the extra tax and suffering the most. They are people with a wheel, whatever type of a vehicle it is, and they are suffering. I ask the Minister and his Government to give attention to those people today, not in October. Many of them will be gone under come October. That is the truth. The Minister has heard Deputy Michael Collins speak about the fishermen. It is the very same with lorry and tractor men and the people trying to continue to go to work. Those are the people who are suffering. The Government has extra tax and wriggle room. Please give it back to them - some of them - and do not be keeping it for bankrolling some other airy-fairy idea by the Green Party.	spk_282

I hope the Government will assist in doing something about the position of carers. It is very important for carers to get some respite so they can keep the family member in the home for as long as possible. I know an old gentleman, and he is a gentleman, of 86 years of age who is trying to care for his son who is 46 years old alone. He has been sanctioned for respite care since January but still has not received it. This man is on his knees; he needs home help himself. On the issue of home help, people in Kerry and especially in the Killarney and Castleisland areas are waiting for home help for elderly people to try to keep them in their homes for longer. The HSE says it is having trouble recruiting staff, yet I know staff who are trained but who still will not be hired. They have gone away and taken other jobs after having being trained and doing the courses. What is wrong with the Minister? Why is this happening? It is so important to allow people to stay in their homes for as long as possible, but they are not being assisted. The hospitals are crammed and the emergency departments are clogged up. They have nowhere to go. There should be a small bit of assistance. If more home help and carers were provided, it would give people a chance and they would stay in their homes for longer, which would save the Government millions of euro. However, the Government has no notion at all about millions other than to fire them out wherever it wants, but it will not give them to our own people who really need it.	spk_41

The claim culture, awards by judges and no competition in the market certainly are combining to make insurance more costly than it should be. Our culture is being threatened and many festivals and events are being cancelled because they cannot afford the cost of insurance. Some horse hunts did not operate last winter because they could not get any quote. There was only one company doing it and it would not quote at all. Places like Castleisland had problems with insurance for the races last week. Hopefully they will get going in a couple of weeks' time. Many festivals are threatened and this is threatening our culture. Why is the cost of VHI cover and voluntary health insurance so expensive? If a person goes into any hospital perhaps the cost for a day stay is €75 or €80. If, however, they ask if the person has VHI or that kind of health cover, then the cost is more than €800. Obviously, this is having an adverse effect on the poor people who are trying to provide health cover for themselves. This is what is coming out of it. We miss Seán Quinn being out of the market. We just do not have enough competition. Hotels are being asked to pay premiums from €62,000 to €120,000. Consider also the young people trying to get car insurance who are being quoted in excess of €3,000. I am a firm believer that youth should get a chance. Until they blot their copybook they should get a fair chance to go on the road. These quotes are on top of all the other costs they must pay to attain their driver's licence, including driver instructor fees and the price of the licence and all of that. With regard to community and voluntary organisations, 40% of them have said that their future is threatened and 90% of the survey respondents said that the Government is not doing enough.	spk_177

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-06-21	dail	33	Our Lady's Hospital Navan Emergency Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	I also thank Deputy Guirke and Sinn Féin for giving us this opportunity to talk about our regional hospitals. I concur with everyone else here in asking that Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, and its accident and emergency department be kept open because it is most important. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae stated, our accident and emergency department at University Hospital Kerry in Tralee is clogged up day after day. We have highlighted this here so many times, and the same thing is still happening. Even today we are hearing that there are 21 people on trolleys and last Thursday and Friday 17 people were on trolleys. That is not good enough. No mention is made of the number of people who are waiting on chairs. When they run out of trolleys, people are put on chairs and they are not counted at all for some reason or another but they are human beings. When they get sick they go to hospital and they need attention, which they are not getting. I am glad to take the calls I get on this at 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. from an 89-year-old or a 91-year-old woman or man on a trolley and their families are so concerned. They often say that maybe they should not have taken them into the hospital at all because at least they would be in bed at home. That is not good enough. We have to increase capacity and the number of workers. I compliment the workers in University Hospital Kerry and in our community hospitals throughout the county, like Kenmare Community Hospital, Killarney Community Hospital and Bantry General Hospital, where we also go. I compliment the workers on the service we get from them when they are under so much pressure. The Government has to wake up. We need to increase capacity at University Hospital Kerry. We are waiting for consultants and we cannot get nurses. Why is it that we cannot recruit consultants, nurses or staff in University Hospital Kerry and yet Cork University Hospital and the bigger hospitals have no problem in doing so? Is it the way the HSE is not offering them enough? Then we heard this morning that HSE officials or consultants are getting €700,000 per year. There is no man or woman in this country or in any part of the world worth that kind of money. The Government has to wake up. That would comfortably employ 12 people but to give it to one person is ridiculous.	spk_241

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-06-15	dail	33	Energy Security: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am pleased to get the opportunity to speak on this very important motion this morning. I thank Deputy Collins for highlighting the very attractive proposal of utilising the Barryroe oil and gas field off the south coast of Cork. It is understood that 365 million barrels of oil and gas are deposited there and deeper exploration could unearth much more. At a time the country is struggling to survive because of massive increased costs for oil and gas, it would surely be helpful if we could access even some of this from our own oil and gas fields in Barryroe. Moreover, as the Kinsale field is exhausted, and the Corrib field deposits of gas are waning quickly, it is vital that we utilise Barryroe and resume drilling for gas off the west coast of Kerry, which the Government stopped, as we will need gas and oil for at least 40 more years. We should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and use our own jurisdiction to the maximum. The further away the source of oil and gas imports - that is if we are able to get them - the greater the carbon footprint. The closure of Bord na Móna in the midlands and stopping the generation of electricity in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge were short-sighted. We all know that since these generating stations were closed the cost of electricity has gone up daily. The Government should reverse this decision and utilise every bit of turf we have in the country. Turf kept this country going during the Second World War. Shannon LNG should also get the licence to import gas from western sources such as the United States and other countries that would be minded to sell gas to us. It will not cost the country 1 cent as this company has spent several million euro to date and will totally fund the operation itself. As a reliable energy source with low emissions, gas must remain part of the energy mix. With the trouble caused by Putin and Russia and the problem that we have in the United Kingdom, we need gas from a reliable source, and we need another source now to ensure future energy security and economic prosperity. I cannot understand it. Cork is lucky to have the Taoiseach at the present time and two senior Ministers. The Government is acting recklessly by not listening to this proposal to provide energy off the county they represent. They are also representing the country and the country depends on energy security. Continuing to expose the country to global oil increases and raking in millions of euro in every kind of tax is all reckless behaviour. The Taoiseach promised the people of north Kerry when canvassing with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, in the 2020 general election that he would ensure Shannon LNG got over the line. Now he has allowed the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to make submissions against this proposal. This is also reckless. We have to be realistic as families need cars to go to work. There are no other options for people in rural Ireland. They need cars to go to work and to take their children to school. They are struggling. Many families are in serious jeopardy. The running costs of lorry transport have doubled. I saw the price of diesel all along the road as I came up the day before yesterday. It was €2.10 for diesel and €2.20 for petrol. Farmers and contractors are paying €1.60 a litre for green diesel. They are under immense pressure and the Government is doing nothing to help them. The Government could take less tax, but it does not want to do that. Another issue concerns private bus operators transporting children to school. The Minister is not doing enough. The Government could at least forgo the extra carbon tax and excise VAT that it is clawing back now. The senior Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on 19 May addressed the Seanad on energy and stated:We have never found oil in commercial quantities. All the likely sites…are in very deep, distant waters.That is incorrect. What the Minister said is that we just do not have a lot of oil and gas reserves. These statements are incorrect, and I cannot understand why he made them. It shows his fundamental lack of knowledge on this very important matter. The Barryroe discovery is in 100 m of water, 50 km offshore and is regarded as the largest undeveloped hydrocarbon field in Europe. The accepted industrial reserve projections indicate 365 million barrels of equivalent oil and gas resources in that field. I ask the senior Minister to correct the record because he has misled the Houses of the Oireachtas.	spk_25

My understanding of the words ""just transition"" is different from the Government's. As Deputy Nolan said, there are no alternatives, or very few, and we are now being threatened in here day after day. It is as if the Government is trying to muzzle us. I guarantee the Minister of State that while we are elected here we will not be muzzled or held back by anyone. We have a right to represent the people and I have a right to represent the people of Kerry. I have no problem with electric cars when they are economical and practical, provide durability and can travel the distance and when the Government provides enough charging points and faster charging points. I have no problem with the Government wanting to stop us cutting turf, but it must provide the alternatives. People need to be let use turf to warm their homes, as they always have done. Maybe, in time, transition will come. We will give the next generation a chance. Europe said the other day that no more new petrol or diesel cars can be bought after 2035. That is bully work, and that is what the Government is doing now. That is how the Government is depicted in rural Ireland: bullies trying to bully us all in a hurry. On top of the exorbitant cost of fuel at present, the Government is taking in more tax, including carbon tax, VAT and excise duty. The Government is so greedy and cannot understand that the people on the roads are being driven into the ground because they cannot afford the cost of fuel at present. The Government will not do anything for them. It will not listen. If we say anything, we are criticised."	spk_234

It is important at this time of the year. It is the same every year. Parents are worried and anxious, ready to tear out their hair because they cannot get a place for these children with special needs. It seems to be a continuation. Some schools have benefited but more have not. I could give examples of many worried parents throughout County Kerry who are at their wits' end and simply cannot find a school place for their son or daughter with special educational needs. When a child develops a problem it is a serious burden for parents. They need help and should have the right to full-time education. The State is not meeting that obligation to educate children with disabilities. This represents a gigantic failure on the part of the Government to address this long-standing issue. I believe there has been an increase in cases of autism. Our medics should look to see what is causing that because these vulnerable children are being discriminated against. The whole situation is damaging for the health and well-being of all the families affected. Meanwhile, many other cases throughout the country involve parents being forced to fundraise to finance the salary of an SNA. This is unacceptable. While I have the Minister for Education here and given that she is from Kerry, I have to raise the issue of Ballyduff National School and Tarbert National School. These schools are set to lose teachers this year because at the end of September last year, when assessing the number of teaching staff required, they were down perhaps one child.Since that, they are catering for 16 extra children from Ukraine whom they are delighted to have and they are doing their best to see after them. There are language barriers etc. and they are trying to overcome them. They are doing their level best. Surely, we must do something. I expect Deputy Foley, as a Minister from Kerry, surely to see after Ballyduff and Tarbert national schools to ensure that they do not lose a teacher. Every parish has a hollow, maybe, where they go down a few children. Of course, I must ask the Minister about the Black Valley school, which is the only school in the Black Valley. It is a proud community. Like that, they are suffering. Numbers are declining a bit. I believe that if they could get over this hump and if the school could remain open this year - I appeal to the Minister to do her level best to ensure the Black Valley school is not closed on her watch as Minister for Education - when we go on there will be plenty of children but if it is closed, it will never again open.	spk_288

Housing adaptation grant aid for the elderly and mobility aids grants is the most important part of the housing programme in Kerry County Council. We have a very active group of people working in that department. They are doing great work for people who need adaptations and little things to make their houses more acceptable to live in and to ensure that they stay in their homes longer. I must mention people like Joanne, Josephine and Steffi. They are such great girls. I also mention Donal O'Regan and all the other men and women who are working in that department in Kerry County Council and who are doing great work. The Minister has to realise, however, that the cost of materials and labour has gone through the roof and that the grants are not meeting the cost of the jobs that need to be done. There has not been an increase for many years. We need such an increase now. If an extension is required, there does not seem to be any money to do that. There might be enough for one or two in the whole country each year. Take the example of a farmer's house that has fallen into complete disrepair and cannot be refurbished. I have asked the Minister several times to give funding to the local authorities in order that they can get a demountable home - a mobile home - and finish their days on the farm where they have been all their lives.	spk_33

Where is this rule coming from? Is it from the HSE, the Government or the Chief Medical Officer? It does not make sense at all.

My only worry is the length of time allowed to put in amendments. Even though the Bill has been discussed for many years it is now upon us and we must deal with it. We will do so but it is only as the Bill progresses through these Houses and when we see the amendments that we will make the ultimate decisions about what the Bill will look like when the work is completed. As I said, the changes the Bill proposes to bring about have been discussed for many years. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) 2015 Act aimed to introduce a new protection regime and new legal framework for supported decision-making for vulnerable adults with a rights-based approach to decision-making capacity. We all know people, even young people, for whom something goes wrong with the most important part of them, which is the top shelf. Some may have an accident, elderly people may have a stroke and there is also those who have dementia.I know of one case where dementia set in within the space of two weeks. Everything was left up in a heap for that family. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae referred to the power of attorney, but who thinks of doing that? People do not think of giving somebody the power of attorney when they go to make a will. There is much talk about making wills and we have been getting advice about that for years, but seldom have we heard of people being advised to give power of attorney to a family member or a friend in case some of these life-changing illnesses occur. There are instances where, due to stroke or dementia, a farmer is in a nursing home. He does not know where he is, and he could live there for four, six, eight or even in some cases 11 years. The farm payments to keep the farm going are jeopardised, as are the grants and so forth that are depended on to put food on the table. The cattle cannot be sold. The herd number and the whole lot are up in a heap. It is very important that this Bill emphasises that the power of attorney should be availed of by people of all ages, but especially after mid-life. We all know there are accidents of every type on the road. The soundest people end up in a very bad way and they leave things for the family in a bad way too. Under this amendment Bill, the current substituted decision-making under wardship will be replaced by assisted decision-making and will be based on an adult's ability to make a specific decision at a specific time. Then there are cases where people get better. As the saying goes, they come back from a very bad state, so we must cater for that as well and ensure that people can take back control of their own business if they recover. I know of somebody who was unconscious and given over for dead for more than 12 months. That person has woken up. He is a young fellow of 21 or 22 years of age who was hit by a car. He woke up the other day and his first words were: ""I love you, Mam"". We must cater for those types of decisions as well to ensure that those people get their rights. We will all play our part and table amendments if we see they are needed. We will support or oppose amendments as they are dealt with. We propose to work with the Minister of State."	spk_268

We should all aspire to get young people to vote. We hear of many youngsters who when they turn 18 years of age do not turn up on the register for whatever reason.Something needs to be done. A bit of common sense must be applied here. I know that in schools they have the dates of birth of students, and they know their ages. At this stage, young people should be automatically put on the register when they reach 18 years of age. Instead, we find that so many of them are not on it when we go around one or two weeks before an election. It is absolutely ridiculous. Given all the information the authorities have, including PPS numbers and the whereabouts of people, as well as the census, in the era in which we live there should be some way for automatic registration. When people move, they are taken off the register in the area where they lived - whoever is good enough to do that - but they have no vote in the new area. Although they are taken off automatically, they are not put on automatically. We find ourselves with an awful lot of work to do. It is my belief that nobody should be taken off the register unless they are put on it somewhere else. I know the political parties have done this in the past. They take people off, but they do not look to put them on where they go. This is something on which we should all work together to ensure that every youngster and person who is in an area has an entitlement to vote, whoever they vote for. I hope they vote for me when my name is on the ballot paper, but they should surely vote for someone. We should all ensure that they have a vote.	spk_101

The cost of fuel, especially diesel and petrol, is the main contributory reason for the increased cost of food. Lorry transport costs have increased significantly and farmers face increased costs to produce food. Whether they are dairy or beef farmers or tillage farmers, the savage extra cost of diesel alone and the considerable cost of fertiliser are driving production costs through the roof. The Government should and could take less tax from fuel. It has been raking it in since the base cost increased. Other countries are taking less tax. Why can the Government not do the same? It is not fair on people who have to pay to go on the road, that is, every man or woman with a wheel. They are paying savage costs and it will not be long until they are ground to a halt. The Government could take less tax and that would help. We have to start somewhere, and as the teacher said to me long ago when I was in school, when you are unravelling a stocking, you should begin at the toe. We have to begin where the trouble started and that is with the increased costs, which have to be reduced. The cost of electricity is also driving everything mad and it has increased every day since the Government closed Bord na Móna. The Government stonewalled and said it would have to get permission from the EU to reduce VAT on fuel, but no permission was needed when VAT was being increased. I have never heard of the Government having to go to the EU for permission to increase VAT, yet it had to ask the EU, or so it claimed, to be allowed to bring it down.	spk_203

They are public roads, not private ones. To qualify, there must be at least two landholdings. The council would not dream of dealing with private roads where there was one or two houses and no landholdings. We are talking about public rights of way and public roads. Our county’s list was completed in 2018. Mixed into that were 90 applications made between 2007 and 2012. That was wrong. People on these roads pay every kind of tax – carbon tax, motor tax, income tax, property tax and the universal social charge. Indeed, people on these roads cost the State very little. Most have their own septic tanks and water and farmers on public water supplies pay savage water bills. They have built and maintained their own houses. These roads are also used by others providing services – milk lorries, feed lorries, tractors, ambulances, doctors, home helpers, postmen, public health nurses, vets, departmental inspectors, school buses and cars taking children to school. These are public roads. The Department says that they are private roads, and this is where the Government has gone wrong, so I ask the Minister to challenge the Department. These are not private roads, but public ones.	spk_247

These are public roads. The Department says that they are private roads, and this is where the Government has gone wrong, so I ask the Minister to challenge the Department. These are not private roads, but public ones.	spk_247

I do not mind whether the money comes from the Department of Transport or the Department of Rural and Community Development. I have a serious ask for the Minister. There are 678 roads and if we only do 19 or 20 a year, it will take us a long time, which is not fair on the people of Kerry. The people on these roads are every bit as entitled to a good road as the people in Dublin 4. We have to recognise the problem and deal with it, and that problem is funding. I appreciate that the Minister is doing her best and I agree with her that the Department of Transport should facilitate these people. The Minister talks about cycling on her road but you cannot cycle on any of these roads now because you are in and out of potholes and the traffic is massive. The people on these roads are entitled to better and I am asking the Minister, as a Minister from a rural county, to respond and do more for us. We are in a bad situation.	spk_251

As has been pointed out to me, these medical students have gone through a five-year course and are highly trained with special skills.They are vital to the running of hospitals like University Hospital Kerry in Tralee, where I am sorry to say that many appointments have been cancelled in recent days. That is not fair on the people who need procedures. I hope that they are being carried out today. I have friends and special people who have been waiting a long time and are hopeful that their procedures will go through today. I am not blaming the current Minister, but the HSE. These people are being underpaid. Just look at the courses they had to take and the experience they needed to gain. Proper outcomes, and many lives, depend on them. We must see after them. At the heart of this situation is the increased cost of living. They are just fighting for a chance to live, put food on their tables and support their families. The suspension of appointments is jeopardising outcomes for people who have been waiting a long time. I am pleased that talks are going ahead. They should have gone ahead long ago. Will the Government please rectify the situation? It should not be happening. I am blaming the HSE, not individual Ministers.	spk_36

As Deputies are aware, there is a lot at stake at present in the context of the Good Friday Agreement. It is clear that the protocol and the legacy issues are all currently being discussed.All of us need to work extremely hard together and be united in ensuring that we maintain peace and protect the Good Friday Agreement. Brexit was a fierce disappointment which upset the harmony that existed between Ireland and England. Being nearest neighbours, Ireland and England benefited from that but, sadly, Brexit was Britain's decision and the route that was taken. It is having an effect on our economy and the work we do. There are severe delays and losses in bringing goods and services back and forth between Ireland and England. We certainly need to get the Stormont assembly and the other institutions up and running again. Following the recent election, the unionists are not happy campers. We need to bring them along and ensure we do not go back to the rancour we had in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. We need the people in the North to work and we must allow them to do their work like any normal people. We need to ensure the survivors and victims get satisfaction and not the amnesty being proposed by England. We all need to thank Representative Richard Neal and the US delegation for taking an interest by visiting us yesterday and going up to the North today. He is doing whatever he can to ensure the Good Friday Agreement and all the institutions are kept in place.	spk_191

I thank Sinn Féin, and Deputy Ó Broin in particular, for affording us this time to speak on housing. Certainly, housing for people who do not have homes is very important. We need to discuss all aspects of housing. I do not agree with the Bill. It is basically a Bill for Dublin rather than one for rural Ireland. Maybe it is a more dominant issue for Dublin than it is for rural Ireland. The Bill will not sort the problem we have with housing. The way to sort the problem is to build more houses and to keep doing so. The local authorities should be afforded money to build houses, like they always did in the past, rather than having all these other schemes. In Kerry, we are glad that in the past few days several houses have come on stream in Killarney. We thank Kerry County Council for building those houses in a very short time. They are very welcome indeed. I thank the likes of Michael Cronin - or Mike Jack, as we call him in Kerry - for all the houses he has built in Killarney and Milltown for Clúid. We should also recognise the great work KPH Construction is doing in Barraduff. More funding needs to be given to local authorities, however. I will take one aspect of housing in Kerry that is under pressure. There are so many voids but the local authority is not getting the money to turn them around. When the tenant purchase scheme was operating properly, the money Kerry County Council got from selling a house to a tenant went straight into voids. That is not happening any more because the tenant purchase scheme was not fit for purpose in the first place, with the 80% figure. Even the new tenant purchase scheme is not a proper scheme. Many landlords do not want to let long-term for various reasons. Between finding or building a house and paying for it, there is a lot of trouble involved in acquiring a house. It should surely be the right of the person who owns the house to do whatever they want with it. They may want to let it for a few months in the short term. I know many landlords or people who own houses who rent them for a few months and are glad of the few bob. I met a couple the other day who are letting their property for the legal 90 days. They are going to live with her mother for the 90 days. They are letting the house because they want to put money aside to send their youngsters to college. God almighty, they should not be stopped from doing that. They are a very respectable and honourable couple but they were encountering problems with letting the house. I hope it is sorted now. The visitors who come to rural Ireland for a few months mean a lot to the local economy in rural places such as Gneevgullia, Scartaglin and Kilgarvan.It boosts the local pub or shop. That means something. We should not deprive those people of that. The other thing is that these visitors want to experience rural areas. They perhaps left cities and hotels and gave half their life living in those very bright-light urban areas and want to experience a local place. If we were to hurt those people who operate what they call this Airbnb system, it would be wrong. The other thing is that a Bill like this is not enforceable. On asking the local authorities to monitor this, I know and respect the local authority we are dealing with in Kerry and they have enough to do. Their outlook should be to provide housing and that is what they want to do, rather than monitoring this situation and sending out enforcement letters and whatever. They have enough to do besides doing that.	spk_157
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-05-19	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_29	I wish to raise the restriction by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which prevents many people who wish to exit onto national secondary roads from getting planning permission. This is adversely affecting applicants especially along the N72 from Rathmore to Killarney and from Killarney to Killorglin. We are talking about 22 of the 25 miles. In 2012 the Department authorised the National Roads Authority, NRA, now TII, not to grant permission to planning applicants to access the national secondary roads if the road from which they emerge onto the national secondary road is not in the charge of the local authority. This is very unfair. These roads and junctions are every bit as safe as those that are in the charge of Kerry County Council. Sons and daughters of farmers, landowners and people who have lived and worked their holdings for generations need to build homes for themselves on their own land to be near their ageing parents and to be near their cows in order to milk and calve them. They need to live on the farm on which they work but they are being denied the right by the TII rule. I ask that the TII restrictions be lifted where there is an existing exit onto the N72 serving these holdings, in order that the next generation will be allowed to continue living at home. No extra traffic movements would be created as they would be happy living in their parents' home. My contention is that if a farmer is forced to build or buy a house at a remove from the farm, he will most definitely generate more traffic movements going to and from his outside home to his farm and his ageing parents who are in his care. Many of these local roads are public rights of way serving several holdings, houses and farms. They are the same in every way as those that are in the charge of Kerry County Council. However, Kerry County Council does not now have the funding to take them in charge. These people who pay every tax and abide by every regulation are being blocked from getting planning permission by TII. I wish to stress that what I ask is that where there is an existing exit onto the national secondary road and where the site distance at the junction complies with the regulations, planning be allowed for the landowners' sons and daughters.The problem for all those who cannot get permission in respect of their own land is that they have no hope of getting planning anywhere near their own holdings because all the areas surrounding Killarney - Muckross, Kilcummin, Aghadoe, Fossa and Beaufort - are designated as areas under intense upward pressure. That means there can be no planning for outsiders. The only option left is Killarney town, where land is making €1 million an acre and where houses cost €500,000 to €600,000 or more.	spk_197

That is the point that I am trying to make. Where there is an existing exit, where it is safe and where it meets all the sight distance regulations, I am asking that we review the regulations that are in place because there is a complete blanket ban in place all the way from Rathmore, west of Killarney, around Killarney itself and from Fossa back to Killorglin. It is ridiculous that farmers' sons and daughters cannot get planning permission to build houses for themselves and put a roof over their heads. If they have to live away from the farm and buy a house somewhere else, they are certainly generating more traffic back and forth to the farm, in and out to the farm and back to the houses they are living in. This does not make one iota of sense. I am all for road safety. In many of these places we are talking about, for instance, over and along Ballaugh, there is two miles of a straight road where there is no problem in seeing the traffic coming. It is the same back along Dungeel into Killorglin. There is plenty of sight distance there, and it is wrong to refuse these people.	spk_199

We are sick and tired of the Government blathering, blowing and boasting about affordable houses and Housing for All. It will build 5,500 affordable houses for Dublin and the rest of the 7,500 houses are for the remainder of the country. However, no affordable house will be built in Kerry in the next five years. People are asking me day in and day out where the affordable houses are and when they will come on stream. The Government has no one on the list for Kerry for the next five years. People cannot get planning permission across half of the county. It is more or less sterilised, and the planning regulator is butting in again. He wants to sterilise more of it. I have nothing against the Ukrainians or any people coming into this country but surely the Government should make the same attempt for our own people in Killarney who have been on the list for 13, 14 or 15 years. That is the God's gospel truth. Families that are on the list for nine or ten years are thrown off it because they exceed the €33,600 limit. I have asked the Government to raise that cap. What house could be built with an income of €33,600? One could not build a henhouse to be honest. In the tenant purchase scheme the Government has in place, no one can buy a house that is built after 2015. God almighty, someone may want to buy out a rural cottage that is built on their own land when they get on their feet but the Government has disallowed that. The money acquired from the tenant purchase scheme used to go into doing up voids. We have no money to do up voids in County Kerry. That is the God's gospel truth.	spk_80

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-05-18	dail	33	Just Transition: Statements	dbsect_15	I am afraid the Minister's understanding of a just transition is very different from mine and that of many other people. He kicked up a hullabaloo a number of weeks ago regarding the sale of turf. Given the small volume of turf being sold in the country, that he prioritised it in such a way hurt many people in my county, Kerry, where many people have traditionally cut turf over the years to keep themselves warm. In a way, I have to thank the Minister. Many people realise there is trouble afoot and that fuel and heating oil is getting very expensive, and they have gone back to the bogs this year because they do not want to be cold on Christmas night or to have nothing in the hearth to keep themselves warm. Many of them, therefore, have returned to cutting turf. If the Minister left people alone, the practice would die out in any event because the next generation, or perhaps the generation after that, would not cut any turf. Instead, he is trying to force people into electric cars, without sufficient infrastructure, and closing Bord na Móna. Every day since that began, the cost of electricity has increased. The Government has no alternative in place. As for the retrofitting scheme, the Government is offering grants of €25,000 when people do not have the matching money to come up with €25,000 or €30,000 more. Elderly people have only so much time on their side and the Government could give smaller grants for insulation, yet they say they are denied that. If they have ever got so much as €300 or €400 in the past 20 years by way of a grant, they will be ruled out of getting any grants now. Likewise, carbon tax has no effect on the circumstances in which we find ourselves and only hurts people.	spk_285

Under the revised scheme, an injured member of the force will make an application to the Garda Commissioner, who will then cause a report to be prepared. Where the report concludes that an applicant was injured as a result of a malicious incident, the report will be sent to PIAB. Under the current Garda compensation scheme, applications are made to the Minister for Justice for an initial assessment. Trainee gardaí who are currently excluded will be eligible for compensation under the new scheme. This is very welcome, because previously they were excluded. Under the current legislation, applications for compensation must be made to the High Court regardless of the amount in damages being sought. This has led to delay and high costs for both the applicant-claimant and the State. It is proposed that PIAB will assess claims using a quantum. Legal representation is not required but can be used for applications to PIAB. Where a claimant is not happy with the proposed award, he or she may apply to the courts. This Bill will allow applications to be made in the appropriate court, whether it be High Court, Circuit Court or District Court. It is envisaged that using PIAB as an assessor of compensation will mean fewer cases progressing to the courts. This will lead to a reduction in legal costs. The total amount of awards that were paid out under the current scheme between 2016 and June 2021 was €26.1 million. The actual legal fees paid out amounted to the staggering figure of almost €10 million - €9.96 million. It is hard to believe that. The legal costs incurred in proceedings regularly exceeded the amount of damages actually awarded. Therefore, we welcome this Bill and it is imperative that it be brought into operation as quickly as possible, because the current legislation is well past its sell-by date and has many defects in it. We welcome the fact that this Bill provides a streamlined and simplified method for members of An Garda Síochána who are entitled to compensation to have their case dealt with in a manner that is free from legal manipulations and costly High Court cases. The court scheme favours the legal profession as much or more than the members of the Garda that it is intended to serve. It is hoped that this Bill will achieve a greater degree of fairness and transparency for members of the Garda. We often hear stories of situations under the current scheme where one garda receives a certain level of compensation from one High Court judge, while another garda with exactly the same personal injuries receives a lesser or greater payout. However, one clear omission from this Bill is the fact that while members of the Criminal Asset Bureau will receive coverage, civilian members of An Garda Síochána who operate, for example, under the functions of the criminal assets legislation will not be covered. The complete exclusion of civilian staff of An Garda Síochána from the remit of the Bill is poor and we are calling on the Minister to address this concern. This would be particularly important in a changing environment where many technical functions associated with criminal investigations that are now carried out by members of An Garda Síochána will also be carried by civilian employees or staff members of An Garda Síochána into the future.	spk_302

We certainly need a new maternity hospital in the city of Dublin, and for the country as well. I do not understand why the people who are objecting to this do not understand they are getting lands worth more than €50 million or €60 million, mostly free of charge or at a €10 per year for 299 years. How much is that when 299 years is several lifetimes?I cannot understand it, and especially some of the people who are against this deal. The debate around the delivery of the new national maternity hospital and its relocation fails to take full account of the substandard maternity facilities in other hospitals and promises made by the previous few Governments to provide new and improved standards of care for women. In fact, four upgraded maternity hospitals have been promised but none has actually been delivered, and we are being critical now of the Government for providing a maternity hospital of the highest worldwide standards. That is what we want to ensure. I cannot understand it. Of course, as has been said by other speakers, there is a hatred of the Catholic religion. There is a hatred of nuns and priests and, yes, some of them did wrong in the past. However, many of them did an awful lot for young boys and girls and men and women around the country and they have to be appreciated for that.	spk_348

It is gas to see Labour Party Members try to make amends after the harm they did when they were in government and were in power. I know better than anyone else that people's wages do not go far enough now because of the cost of everything, including the cost of travelling to work. In Kerry, people need to travel to work. There are no buses or public transport from places like Gneevgullia, Lauragh or Cahersiveen. In the hinterlands of those great places there is no public transport. However, those people are paying carbon tax to reduce bus fares in this city. I support the thrust of the Bill, but employers are also in the mix. Nobody here is helping employers - putting every regulation in the world on them and putting every increase in their way by the way of carbon tax, which the Labour Party and all Government parties have supported in every motion in this Dáil Chamber.

It is sure we must do everything we can. It is very clear that what is going on are war crimes affecting civilians. The way they are being treated, bombarded, hurt, maimed and killed, it is clear war crimes are being committed at present. We must monitor and ensure that if it can happen, it should happen that this fella, Putin, will be prosecuted and get the proper penalty he deserves. In the past week, one of his lieutenants has suggested doing something to Ireland. In that vein, there have even been calls in the Chamber this morning for the Russian ambassador to be sent home. I say no such thing. We should keep him here. If Russia and Putin do anything to our country or to our people, if they suggest or do anything untoward to our people in our country, the ambassador should be the first fella to be targeted, locked up somewhere, the key thrown away, and an odd bite to eat thrown to him now and then to keep him barely alive. We never did anything out of the way to Russia and it is wrong of it to target us here in the middle of the ocean. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the Russian ambassador does not go home, or his entourage and the people with him in the ambassador's residence, wherever it is. Not one of them should be allowed to go home. If they do any act or hurt Ireland in any way, he should be the first man to be targeted and minded to ensure we get some good out of him and do not let him go.

The cost of rent is exorbitant in Kerry as well, in places like Killarney, Tralee and Dingle. It is also hard to find places to rent because there is no availability. While I, like everyone else, welcome the Ukrainian people here, we need to be inventive about where we can house them because we certainly cannot lose. There are people in Kerry who have been on the list, like youngsters I know, for 15 or 16 years and still have not got a house. We need to be more inventive. There are places like St. Finan's Hospital. There are vacant houses around. The Minister of State should delegate the local authority to send out people to investigate why houses are empty or if there could be a deal done with them. Some people are coming forward but they do not know who to come forward to.There is no direct line they can contact. Already, our hotels and guesthouses are full. It will jeopardise our tourism product. We cannot ask our people on the housing list to wait any longer. Landlords are selling up and getting out of the business because they are paying 52% tax. The number of voids, according to Kerry County Council, is at an unacceptable level. The local authority states the tenant purchase scheme used to generate money for the local authority to do up houses, but tenants cannot purchase houses until they are tenants for more than ten years.

The discrimination is having a deeply unsettling effect on the teaching profession. The Minister said an agreement has been reached or whatever. When will these teachers actually receive the pay they are being denied? That is the question. When will that happen? We are told there is already a deterioration in the quality of services being provided to the young students being taught because teachers are not staying. That has a kind of unsettling effect. When students get used to a certain teacher, it is hard for them to lose that teacher in the middle of their education.	spk_127

It is clear they are bogged down to the bane. Fertiliser costs are savage and are putting farmers under savage pressure. However, if proper levels of lime were applied to the land, it would increase fertility, make it more productive, and reduce the amount of fertiliser needed to be spread on the land. Will the Minister bring back the subsidy for lime? It was there before. I am asking for this, please, given the increased transport costs for delivering lime and the increased cost of everything. It would help farmers a lot to bring back the subsidy for lime. If the Government is real about reducing nitrate use, this would be one way to help.	spk_400
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-04-27	dail	33	Carbon Tax: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	I am very glad to get another opportunity to talk about the serious matter of the infliction of extra charges to people all over the country. The Minister wants to carry on his crusade of increasing the carbon tax and penalise many sectors and people all over the country, especially in rural Ireland. Sadly, I believe he is not doing any good, only harm, in Government. I was brought up being told that if you cannot do any good for people, please do not hurt or harm them. The understanding was, in the first place, that the carbon tax on diesel, petrol and kerosene was a measure by the Government to coax people away from those fuels and types of vehicles to electric vehicles and to use electric heating in their homes. However, the Government does not have the infrastructure in place for electric cars and it certainly does not have the facility to generate extra electricity. The Minister has to realise that the savage global increase in the cost of fuels in the past six months makes fuel already more expensive than people can bear or afford. This carbon tax has not one iota of an effect on reducing emissions. The Government must realise that enough is enough and there is a place called stop. It has to forget about another increase in the carbon tax. This carbon tax increase will mean that car users will pay more than €10 more to fill their tanks. Lorry drivers will pay €80 or €100 in carbon tax to fill their tanks on top of excise and VAT. I fear the haulage industry will grind to a halt. Farmers and agricultural contractors are now being asked to pay €50 to €70 per day in carbon tax alone to keep their tractors going and do the vital seasonal work that has to be done to ensure a fodder supply for our animals and that crops are sown and reaped to have food for all the people of our country. From 1 May, the carbon tax increase on top of the current carbon tax will mean people will have to pay €106.07 more in carbon tax on a 900 l tank of home heating oil. The Minister of State said the Government is giving money back to the people. What is it giving back to the people in respect of rural public roads? It gave money for 12 schemes out of 676 schemes that are on a list below in Kerry. People are banging in and out of potholes and ruts in roads with tractors and cars. That is what the Government gave them back out of all the tax they are paying. The Minister of State said the Government is giving more out in fuel allowance, but people on benefit payments do not qualify for any fuel allowance. People on jobseeker’s, illness, enhanced illness, occupational injuries, maternity or disabled benefits, or a pensioner living with a cancer patient on illness benefit, will not qualify for the fuel allowance. Yet the Government wants to cripple these people further by increasing the carbon tax for heating their homes and driving their cars. Shame on the Minister. This Government has made no attempt in providing alternative energy since it started. It has closed down Bord na Móna. The cost of electricity has gone up every day and there is no real alternative, only drawing coal from Russia to keep Moneypoint going. There are incentives in place for private sources to supply energy to the grid. There are several options that could be explored, such as solar panels, and people could be exempted from tax on those. I ask the Minister to ensure that, if he opens up that scheme, he will not raid people’s properties that are supplying carbon tax. The Minister crossed the line with turf. He went far beyond the line when he suggested that people should stop cutting and selling turf. It is all the same because when you mention turf in rural Ireland, you are hurting everyone in rural Ireland. We had a vote on the carbon tax a couple of weeks ago.

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-04-27	dail	33	No. 2 - Mineral Oils Tax: Financial Resolution	dbsect_34	We have been asking for some real meaningful reduction for motorists, the haulage industry and people who use fuel to heat their homes. We have asked for it day after day here. What the Government is offering this evening is very minimal. The Government is saying that this is what is being provided and that it had to get permission from Europe to be allowed to reduce the VAT rate. In all my time, I never heard that we had to ask Europe to increase it in the first place. That is a fact. I know I am right. I never heard that the Government had to get permission to increase it in the first place. Reducing VAT on gas and electricity to 13.5% and 9% only is of no use to the people who are on the road with four wheels under them, whatever type of vehicle it is. That is not enough. These people are hard-pressed and their backs are to the wall. What is being offered is very minimal and it is not enough. The carbon tax on a 900 litre fill of home heating oil is €106.07. That is massive. As I said earlier today, people are under savage pressure, especially those who are working and who on their own. Farmers are hard-pressed with the savage cost of fuel. The Government is hurting people very badly. People in Kerry, the county that I am proud to represent, are being hit by the suggestion that they cannot buy turf. Is it because there is no VAT in turf? What set did the Government against turf all of a sudden? There is so much else to be sorted out in the world. We see what is happening in other countries. We are all under the one sky. Look at what they are doing in America. Look at the size of the vehicles that they are driving. Russia and China are using coal-burning power stations to generate electricity. The Government trying to stop poor people who have traditionally cut and sold turf to their neighbours. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications said that grannies would not be criminalised. God almighty, these people are the people who brought our country to where it is today. They worked flat on their backs when there was nothing at all in this country. They cut the turf and kept themselves warm. It is absolutely ridiculous to think that at the end of their days, some Minister in power would try to stop them from buying a few bags of turf, a rail of turf or a butt of turf, as it was known. It is absolutely ridiculous. Our family unit would have disintegrated back in the early 1930s and 1940s if it was not for turf. All my grandmother, grandfather and father had was four cows. They sold a few rails of turf and a bank of turf. The purchaser cut it and saved it themselves. That is how they, and many people like them, survived. The Government has crossed the line with the measure and has hurt many people in rural Ireland. It was the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications who suggested it. He is part of the Government and he has to be controlled. The Government has lost a lot of ground with what he has said and done in the past few weeks. I am sorry that the people of rural Kerry have been hurt. They are angered, mad, sad and sore at what has gone on in the past number of weeks. The Minister had free rein out in the open when he was on holiday. He is nearly more dangerous when is on holiday than when he is here, because we can curtail him some bit. The Government crossed the line in allowing the Minister to do what he did and say what he said.	spk_498

I have no personal gripe with the Minister, but the Government has annoyed and upset many people in rural Ireland over the past fortnight. What has been done is unfair. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, must now realise that what he is trying to do to the people of rural Ireland is blackguarding. He is here now. He has tried to blackguard the people of rural Ireland. People can die of the cold as well as because of bad or smoky air or whatever else it is called. However, they are more likely to die of the cold this winter due to the cost of fuel and everything else. This is the time of year when people take out a sleán and go to the bog. The Minister must realise that China, Russia, Poland, Romania and the USA are digging mountains of coal at the present time. We are all under the one sky, whether the Minister realises that or not. The Minister is focusing his attention on poor people who go to bogs in places like Fybagh, Reaboy and Gneeveguilla or the bogs in Barna. The Minister is trying to stop those people from cutting a bit of turf and selling it to their neighbours, something they have traditionally done. The Minister is trying to take away their traditional rights and culture. He is wrong and should not be hurting ordinary hard-working people in rural Ireland who want a bag or box of turf. With the power he has, what he is trying to do to people is a disgrace.	spk_359

People everywhere cannot believe that, notwithstanding the savage cost of fuel, that the Taoiseach would even consider raising it further. The Taoiseach knows it was the last straw that broke the camel’s back. This is the price that the country and the people of Ireland, young and old, have to pay so that the Taoiseach will have the continued support of the Green Party to remain Taoiseach. The Government has already torn down Bord na Móna. Every day since then, the cost of electricity has gone up. The Taoiseach promised the people of north Kerry when he was canvassing there that he would support Shannon LNG, but now he is against it. Surely, the Taoiseach knows what is happening around the world. China is building massive electricity-generating stations. Russia is mining coal and oil. The USA is still using massive passenger eight-cylinder vehicles, such as Cadillacs, Lincoln Continental, Chevrolet, massive 5.7 l and 7.8 l eight-cylinder engines. Petrol is $3.80 a gallon there. Here, most people are driving 1.6 l and 2 l cars. Deputy Eamon Ryan is saying that we are still wrong. He wants to price us off the road. The Government will break the country with it targets. Russia, China, India and Africa will keep doing what they are doing. They will do more harm to the environment in one year than Ireland would do in 1,000 years. The Government will close the country down. It will finish up exporting our youth, as happened in the 1950s and early 1960s. The true influence that the war is having on our energy costs has not been felt yet. Hauliers and construction are in serious trouble. Roadbridge has seen the loss of 1,000 jobs. It will have a ripple effect and many others are on the brink. Already ten construction companies have gone down in the UK. We will follow. If every light was turned off and we all left this country, it would only make 0.13% in the worldwide context. We are all under the one sky. The one sun and the one moon is over us all. The Government can cripple our people, cause the loss of thousands of jobs and can break the people, paralyse our farmers and curtail their ability to continue producing food. Nobody has calculated the cost of importing food from places like Brazil or what emissions this will create. It will certainly be more than a farmer in Kerry who is selling an animal to a factory in Bandon or selling over the over the counter in Killarney, Kenmare, Castleisland or indeed Macroom. Deputy Eamon Ryan has been talking about solar energy for years, but we are still waiting for the power purchase agreements, PPAs, to be put in place for microgeneration schemes so that small energy producers can sell extra energy back to the grid. Farmers and industry have acres of farm buildings with roofs on which they could put these solar panels on top.	spk_69

There is so much involved in this area but I will start by thanking all of the childcare providers in Kerry for the great work they are doing. I think of places like Little Acorns in Kilgarvan where my two grandsons, small John and Dan, go. I also think of places like Raheen and the Two Mile School which do so much work in very rural areas. These are the types of crèches and childcare facilities that are under savage pressure. They are worried. Listening to the Minister earlier, one would think that the whole lot was sorted but it is far from sorted. There is an awful lot of work to do and money to be provided to ensure that they can continue to do the great work they are doing. This is very important for couples when they have children because both parents have to work to keep a roof over their heads, to pay mortgages or rent and to pay for everything else, including insurance and getting to work. Everything is so expensive now and couples need to work. Both parents need to work and they have to be able to put their children into a crèche or early childcare facility. The crèche operators have to answer to at least four different agencies, including Tusla, Pobal, the Department of Education and their local authorities. They have so much to do. They are highly qualified and they mind our children well. They must be looked after or we will lose them. Many of the smaller providers are indicating that they will not be able to survive and only the bigger facilities will continue to operate but parents can only travel so far. Childcare facilities have to be within their own catchment area. We must ensure that the smaller providers continue to operate. Otherwise, we are doomed and they are doomed. Our future is in our children and we must ensure they are looked after properly. It is vital that early childhood care and education is given to youngsters. It is vital that they start early and get an early education.	spk_318

I know parents of children who are going mad because they cannot get orthodontic treatment. The children's little gums go too strong and their teeth go wrong so they need treatment. They must wait four years. Please, Minister. There are also cases of scoliosis and spina bifida, and we see little children crying on television telling their stories about their spines going crooked. Please, Minister. The Taoiseach has said the Government was allocating €5.2 million to this but then the Government statement indicates the sum as €4 million per year. Who is right or wrong? Who is the Government trying to kid? Children with Down's syndrome dearly need the July provision but there is a lack of such services every year when it comes to July. Those children need routine and continuity in schooling. If they miss July, they can lose an entire year. There is no accountability in the Government, the Department of Health, the HSE or the services that are supposed to be provided. The entire process is going wrong.	spk_224
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-03-23	dail	33	Ban on Sex for Rent Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am glad to get the opportunity to speak. I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and the Social Democrats for bringing this Bill before us. I am amazed that there was no way to deal with this offence before. Remarkably, the Minister for Justice has confirmed that no specific criminal offence for this practice currently exists in Ireland. It is amazing that, as matters stand, there is no way to deal with some landlord or other person who could prey on vulnerable women, and men also. It is wrong and we have to support this Bill. I thank the Social Democrats for highlighting it. We read what an examination by the  As has been stated, we do not seem to be improving housing options for many and there are many still without homes. We appreciate what the Government is doing for the Ukrainian community and we are very sad about what is happening in Ukraine. It is a terrible situation and we appreciate what the Government is doing. In saying that, there are still a lot of people who have been on lists here for years and who are still ringing and ringing, and they have no options available to them. While we see that most of the Government's activities are directed towards Dublin, there needs to be more direction and assistance with housing in Kerry. For example, take people whose houses become derelict on family farms. In times gone by, people could have a demountable home so they could stay in the place they gave all their life to and finish out their days on their farm. That option is not there anymore. We are told that local government no longer has funding for those demountable homes. I have a number of applicants who are in demountable homes for many years and the homes are disintegrating around them, but we have no funding to replace them. That is a crying shame. People in rural Ireland need homes just as much as those in Dublin or anywhere else, but especially on family farms where they gave 60 or 70 years and where they want to finish out their days. Surely the Government must look at that. I ask the Minister of State to have some input into that and to deal with it. Another problem was created by the Tánaiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar. When he was the Minister for Transport in 2012, he gave a direction that there was to be no more planning granted for properties coming out on national roads, even where there is current access. It is ridiculous to think that someone is denied the right of putting a roof over their heads even though they are coming out the same exit onto the national road. If they stay in their mother’s or father’s house, or whatever house was there before, there is no problem with that, but it is only the same level of activity when they build a house for themselves and stay in it. I ask the Minister of State to look at that again. There are many more issues but those two specific issues that I have related to the Minister of State are hurting people at the present time in the county of Kerry which I represent.	spk_39
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-03-23	dail	33	Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_16	I welcome the Bill. Many parents of babies born through surrogacy have contacted me about anomalies that occurred when they brought their babies home. Many couples are unfortunate, in that they cannot have children of their own. For one reason or another, they have been deprived of this. They then do the next best thing, which is surrogacy. Some years ago, a lady I was very close with lost her life trying to have the baby that she and her husband so dearly wished for. They went through many IVF treatments. This lady was young. She jeopardised her own health and lost her life. She went through so many intense treatments that the family believe they played a part in her death. I have been contacted by a number of couples who are having problems becoming legal parents. Usually, the man can become a legal parent but the mother or second parent cannot even become a guardian until after the child is two years old. There are no laws in Ireland governing surrogacy. As a result, biological fathers of children born through surrogacy have more rights than the child's intended mother or second parent. The following issue was brought to our attention by spokespersons for the Irish Families Through Surrogacy advocacy group. Once a child reaches 18 years of age, these women have no standing as a guardian. Up to two years of age they cannot make any decisions regarding the health of their beloved babies. This can only be done by the father. This is a slap in the face to these mothers who care for their children and want to help them in every way possible. That needs to be rectified. As we do not have availability of surrogacy in Ireland, these women have to travel abroad and this is resulting in that discrepancy. I welcome the Bill if it will address these issues. There is another issue in that when the child reaches the age of 18, if the mother wants to transfer her assets or whatever to that child, because she is non-related, the tax exemption is only €16,000. If she was legally deemed to be the child's mother the tax exemption would be €335,000. We all know the value of a house today. If that mother wanted to leave a house to a son or daughter, it is wrong that the difference in tax would be payable to the State. Surrogacy is not a choice; it is a last resort. It can be couples' only opportunity to build a family due to debilitating infertility and medical conditions after a long difficult journey. Many parents who undergo surrogacy are married couples where one or both contribute genetic material to have the maximum possible biological input to their child. The number of emergency travel certificates issued by the Irish Consulate in the Ukraine for children born as a result of surrogacy arrangements have been illustrated in many tables, but they do not include the number of children born in the USA and Canada who also need emergency travel certificates. The figures indicate an upward trend in international surrogacy and the need for international surrogacy to be acknowledged and provided for in legislation. As I said, I support the Bill. I thank the Government for bringing it forward. Much of the time in this House, we are critical of Government, but this is legislation we asked for following this issue having been brought to our attention. We are glad that Government has responded. I hope that the Bill goes through without any major difficulty.	spk_167

It is an insult to the people of Ireland, the working people. It is an insult to the farmers who put so much into producing good food and who have abided by every rule and regulation. What the Government has announced here today will make no material difference. I have no personal gripe with the Minister of State whatsoever but does it not tell it all that the Government has a man who suggested we should bring back wolves? There are enough wolves around barking at every fellow’s door and people trying to stay going. In case the Minister of State does not know it, millions of euro of work has been postponed or cancelled. Hundreds of jobs are being put on hold because people cannot tender or see a way to carry on. To offer a reduction of as little as 2 cent is a shame and disgrace. There is something else happening here as well, of course. We need to get accountability. Where is the regulator? The price of green diesel has almost crept up to the price of white diesel. There needs to be accountability but whatever is done is being taxed by the Government. It is talking about putting up the carbon tax again in May. Other countries have imposed a cap to ensure people know where they are going and to ensure certainty. The increase is too much of a jump in a short time. It is an insult to farmers. What about the elderly who are trying to heat their homes? They have also got a reduction of 2 cent.God almighty, the Minister of State will have to review this and be fair about it. The Government must admit that since the Lanesborough and Shannonbridge power stations were closed down, the price of electricity has gone up weekly. It is 38% or 39% more than it was before the Government closed down those two power stations. What are we doing? We are here one day castigating Putin and every day we are buying coal from him to keep Moneypoint going. That is the truth. That is the God's gospel truth. It is a shame because Europe and our country have been built up. Putin should not be anywhere doing the harm that he is. He should not have been put in a position where he was so powerful that he could do that. I welcome the payment to the healthcare workers. I believe it is unfair that some are deemed ineligible for the payment either because they were sick or had Covid. That must be looked at. Surely, the Minister will see the light there.  Of course, the Government does not want Shannon LNG. The Tánaiste says he has other plans. When will they materialise? We need gas at the present time. We should be able to buy gas from the USA, or from people who are inclined to sell it to us at a reasonable price. The Government does not want Shannon LNG. It would create jobs for people in County Kerry and, in particular, north Kerry, as well as provide energy security. The Acting Chairman never put up a finger to anyone else.

The Government has to impose a cap and ensure certainty in the cost of fuel. Something is going on with the green diesel and the heating oil. There is 2 cent for farmers. Why does the Government hate the farmers so much? The Minister is from Dublin but why does he hate the farmers to only consider giving them 2 cent? Then there is nothing for the home heating oil. The Government has to accept there is an increased tax take from the time a litre of petrol or diesel was €1.20. It is now €2.15, so the Government is getting more. Then the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, says that driving slowly will sort it out. It is like the lunatic is in charge of the asylum. Home helps are struggling, farmers are struggling in many ways, with the diesel on top of it, and workers are struggling, as are hauliers, construction workers and school bus operators who are tied into five-year contracts. Fishermen are abandoning their trawlers. Parents taking children to school are suffering. What is the Government doing? It is importing Russian coal and closing down Bord na Móna.

I thank Deputy Tully for all the work she has put into it. I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak again on this very important subject. For all those parents who learn that there is something wrong with their child or baby, it can be very challenging, daunting and demanding. Those parents would do anything to help their child and pay any kind of money. However, sadly, whether the therapy is to be had privately or publicly, it is always challenging for parents to access the services that are necessary for their children. It is time that we had some assessment or medical report to determine the cause of so many children presenting with the diagnoses of autism, dyslexia or dyspraxia. There seems to be an awful amount of them. In my office on a daily basis, it is one of the problems that parents are raising most consistently in relation to their children. Come August or autumn, when the special needs teachers are being assigned to schools, not enough of them are assigned. Parents learn that their child is not going to get the level of attention that they require. I am sorry to see the Minister of State shaking her head, because it is God's gospel truth. First of all, early diagnosis is most important for these children. They need a lot of personal attention in their formative years. Intervention is vital in ensuring that a child develops to the best that he or she can be. It is vital to bring out the very best in such children. All parents want this for their children. I believe that they are entitled to it. Their children are our future and we need to invest in them. We need to invest more in special needs children.The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is present, is a woman, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. I think they can and should do more for special needs teachers and the sector. They should provide far more such teachers in classrooms because they are vital for so many children. I am concerned at the level of children who are presenting with autism. We need to do more assessment or find out what is going wrong. There are many scientists, doctors and what have you out there and they should be able to determine that there is something causing this.	spk_282

It is a scandal to God that a walk-in service is no longer offered to renew licences in Tralee. People must book an appointment online. People who do not use the Internet have long waits to get through on the phone line to make an appointment. This is something I have to say. To get these people on the phone is absolutely impossible. To those who have phones but will not answer them and will not ring back I say throw them away. These people should be got rid of because they are useless. If I do not answer my phone today or if I do not ring someone back I can expect I will not be in my place after the next election. I will answer my phone and that is what people are supposed to do. It takes forever to get a theory test or a driving test. The RSA will not answer. Old people cannot go over to the office. We are practically the smallest country in the world and we do not have a system whereby we can renew driving licences. People need to have a public services card. This was found to be illegal. Why is the Government allowing this to continue? Is it in power? Applying online is simply not an option for many people, particularly elderly people or those not used to the Internet. There are no drivers for buses, lorries or any other work vehicles. People cannot get licences to go on the road legally. I ask the Government to do something before the country grinds completely to a halt. It is not fair on workers. It is not fair on ordinary people, old people or young people who cannot get a driving licence when they need it.	spk_51

People on these roads pay for everything, from motor tax, to property tax, to income tax.

We welcome those who are seeking refuge here in Ireland and those who have already arrived here safely, especially one girl I know of who arrived in Killarney late last night after travelling from the very first moment of the attack all the way to the Hungarian border, where she was met by her Killarney boyfriend. Her mother is following now. She had been in the car as well but the girl's grandmother got sick and was not able to make the journey, so her mother was not able to come any further. We are asking what we can do. I thank the staff and management of Michael J. Hoare’s machinery sales in Killorglin, in particular Nuala, Timmy, Claire and all of those who are making a massive effort to collect at their premises the utensils, first-aid, bandages, non-perishable food and any other goods that would be of benefit. These are wonderful people who thought of this initiative off their own bat and they are doing their very best to help the Ukrainian people by collecting all of these things. What guns, ammunition or artillery do we have in the Curragh that is not being used at the minute? I do not think it has been used for many years. Maybe we should think of sending this stuff off to people who are trying to defend their families, to the men out there trying to defend their children and their elderly parents. If there is no use for it, and I do not see that there is at the present time, I ask that we send it out there to them. It is frightening to think that we see 40 miles of Russian troops along the motorways into Kyiv and think of what they are going to do when they arrive there. We need to hurt this fellow in his pocket, where it hurts him most, and we all support that initiative. Surely we must stop importing coal from Russia, cop on and have our own natural gas terminal in the Shannon estuary, and get energy from places that might make it readily available to us, so we will not be hurting people in other countries.	spk_314
Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-03-01	dail	33	Health Waiting Lists: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_13	I thank Sinn Féin for bringing this debate to the floor of the Dáil tonight, as it is very important and urgent. The HSE system is failing many sick and vulnerable people all over the country, young and old. Starting with older people in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee where people have been waiting on trolleys for anything up to two or three days in recent months. I refer to people over 80 years, including some who are 90. These men and women have given their lives to rearing families and working all their lives for their families, their communities and their country. They have got us to where we are today, and they are being badly let down. We do not have enough GPs. Young and old who develop medical problems have to wait for as much as a week before they can be seen by a GP. This is not good enough. Patients have to wait months for MRIs, scans or X-rays. That is not acceptable. In the case of cancer, the disease may have progressed to another stage, making a successful outcome less achievable. Why can we not ensure that machines are kept working 24-7, like in the North of Ireland, for instance? I thank the nurses, doctors and all the front-line staff who worked so hard, especially in the past two years with the coronavirus. They worked in terrible conditions and had to contend with staff shortages and expose themselves to contracting the virus. We see what has happened with the CAMHS debacle in south Kerry where the HSE has failed to hire a senior consultant psychiatrist since 2016 and senior management failed to monitor what was going on for five years and the interventions meted out have permanently damaged the health of many. This is criminal. There is an urgent need to recruit psychologists to deal with children at an early age to prevent their mental health being damaged. I firmly believe that abolishing the regional health boards was a major mistake, since the boards ensured that accountability was provided by departmental officials to elected members and senior consultants and doctors who ensured that a respectable level of service was in place for the sick and vulnerable. The Taoiseach has added to his CV that he is proud of getting rid of the regional health boards. He needs to look at that again. I am pleased that Deputy Michael Collins from west Cork and I have successfully operated a cross-Border system for people who would have had to wait for three or four years to get their cataract removed and the same for hips and knees. To date, 84 buses have travelled to the North with the 84th bus going last Friday. One of the first patients on the first bus told me that his grandfather's cataract was removed in St. Catherine's Hospital in Tralee in 1986. That proves that it is backwards that we are going and not improving. The Minister must listen to that. The HSE has totally let down boys and girls affected by scoliosis and spina bifida whose little spines are going out of shape more each day. The Taoiseach said he allocated €5.2 million, yet those who cannot afford to go abroad are still waiting and getting worse each day. That is not good enough. The Taoiseach will not say who is responsible, but Cappagh Hospital says it has consultants available to carry out the procedures. I will give one example about the regional health boards that are so important. In 1986, the Department of Health proposed that six of the district hospitals in the Southern Health Board region would be closed. It was hell-bent on doing it, but lo and behold, wherever he is today, he is dead, but Jackie Healy-Rae was chairman of the Southern Health Board and he and the other elected members stopped the health board and the then Minister, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, from doing that at the time. We have a new hospital in Kenmare today that is stretched to the limit, but we do not have all the beds open there. We need to open the beds. At least when elected people were responsible for deciding what was needed in an area, whether it was community care, a district hospital, if a public health nurse or doctor was needed or whatever else, those matters were dealt with in a progressive manner at the time. Now, there is no accountability at all from the HSE for what it is doing. It is a monster that has gone out of control, not the staff, doctors or nurses working in it, but the management. They are out of order. They are responsible to no one. We must give them as much as they want, be it €400,000 or €500,000 a year, but the people are suffering.	spk_350

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-02-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_29	I want to raise with the Tánaiste the provision of the Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal on the Ballylongford Landbank on the Shannon Estuary. A planning application is being processed at present by An Bord Pleanála. We need this terminal to have energy security into the future. We are leaving ourselves very exposed - given the current situation in Ukraine - importing coal from Russia and Europe importing 30% of its gas from Russia. We see now what this is doing to our fertiliser costs. Wind turbines are fine, but no good when the wind does not blow such as last summer, which was almost totally windless. In Europe, all countries touching the sea have LNG terminals, for example, Portugal, Spain and Holland. Even Malta has an LNG terminal. The Corrib gas field does not have that much more left. Moneypoint, gladly, is going full belt, but the coal to keep those fires burning is coming from Russia. Where are we with that source now given the conflict between Europe and Russia? Anyway, gas is cleaner than coal. We have eight gas-burning stations in the country when they are working but we need gas to keep them going. We will need gas for at least 30 or 40 years. We need to have our own terminal so that we have the option of buying gas from other countries, such as the US, which would be inclined to sell it to us. Now we have the totally reckless act by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who, I see, has disappeared, who has made a submission to An Bord Pleanála against the Shannon LNG application. I believe that this is a misuse and abuse of the Minister's powers as he has demeaned the position of Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. Deputy Eamon Ryan is trying to sabotage one of our options of energy security. I believe that part of the job he is supposed to be doing as Minister is to ensure that we do not run out of electricity. I believe that Deputy Eamon Ryan's objection is ethically and morally wrong and in total contradiction of his portfolio. I am calling for an investigation into what the Minister has done. The Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, stated on Radio Kerry that he was in favour of Shannon LNG yet the Tánaiste has stated he will not support it, but that he will not block it either. The Taoiseach has gone back on his word to the people of north Kerry when he promised that he would support Shannon LNG while canvassing with the Minister for Education, Deputy Norma Foley, in the last general election. He has gone with the wind. He believes in wind energy only now.They closed down Bord na Móna, our own independent energy source, and will not support Shannon LNG. Are they intent on leading us into the dark? It is totally unacceptable to be exposing the country to the lights going off. We have very few options and we do need to get gas from other sources like the United States.	spk_202

The Tánaiste talked about ten years down the road, but what are we going to do in the meantime? I am in favour of wind turbines in the right place, not near houses. Like everything, there are objections to them, and I support the people who object to wind turbines near their houses, but the wind does not blow all the time and we cannot store the energy that is created by the wind. It is very clear to everyone that since Bord na Móna was closed down by the Government the price of electricity has gone mad. We cannot depend on wind energy for the constant supply of electricity. We cannot depend on Russia for coal and gas and now the Government does not want gas to come in from America or other places. What does it want to do? Is the Government setting us up to leave us without any electricity? When it closed down Bord na Móna, it did not provide us with any other option, only to import gas and coal from Russia. That is what we are doing.	spk_204

Danny HealyRae	69	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2022-02-23	dail	33	Supplementary Budget for Rural Communities and Farmers: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important topic. Families and workers in Kerry and all over Ireland are suffering because of the increasing cost of fuel. Many cannot carry on and will not survive. If diesel prices rise further, work will stop and wheels will grind to a halt. The Government did not recognise it two weeks ago but it needs to publish a mini-budget to deal with the problems. The Government cannot increase the carbon tax any further. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, can manage with a bicycle here in Dublin and has several public transport options in the form of trains, buses, the DART and the Luas, but the story is totally different for someone in Gneeveguilla, Scartaglin, Cordal, Castleisland, Brosna or Knocknagoshel who needs to go to work in Munster Joinery or Cadbury in Rathmore, Liebherr in Killarney or Walsh Colour Print. That person needs a car – there is no other option. He or she has to travel several miles to go to work. Parents who have to take their children to school need cars. They have no other choice. When people live in outlying places like Glencar, Killorglin, Cahersiveen and Kilgarvan, they cannot put two or three children up on the bar of a bike together and bring them to school. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in government are content to let the people of rural Ireland suffer all of these extra living costs in order to keep the Green Party on side. Indeed, when we were making our case at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to Mr. Fabien Santini from the EU about the savage increase in fertiliser costs, a Green Party Deputy said that he was happy because it would help farmers to go organic and spread less fertiliser. Being city-based, he believes that saying this will not hurt him electorally, but if the cost of food production increases, the cost to the consumer increases as well. How do Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael backbenchers content themselves with utterances like that? Farmers are terrified and many do not know how or if they will be able to continue. The cost of agri-diesel has increased from 38 cent to more than €1 since this time last year. Feed costs have doubled and fertiliser costs have trebled. Urea fertiliser cost €330 per tonne last July. It now costs €940 and is difficult to get. When we pressed the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on the cost of fertiliser, she told us that the Government had written a letter to someone. God almighty, but is that all it can do? What about dropping the anti-dumping tariff of €50? Would the Government ever consider giving farmers a subsidy of €100 per tonne towards the savage cost of fertiliser? This would help to keep the cost of food down for housewives. Commercial lorry owners in the transport industry are at breaking point. They were outside the gates of Leinster House months ago and made their case in an ordinary and respectful manner. I asked the Taoiseach to forgo the extra VAT and excise duties that the Government was accruing from the increased fuel costs and give the sector a chance but he did not respond and the Government has done nothing. That was three or four months ago. The Government took in an extra €3 billion in VAT returns in 2021 compared with 2020. That was €1 billion more than its own projections. God almighty, but would it give some bit of that money back to people to let them continue operating? Truck owners face several other cost increases for tyres, batteries, AdBlue and many other wearing components. Their prices have doubled. To top it all, truck owners cannot get parts owing to a fierce delay because of Brexit. It is a scandal in God's eyes that people on illness benefit, jobseeker's benefit, maternity benefit, disabled benefit, enhanced illness benefit or occupational injuries benefit do not qualify for the fuel allowance. A pensioner living with a cancer patient who is in receipt of illness benefit will not qualify for the fuel allowance. Even though that person has paid the contributions entitling him or her to get the benefit, he or she cannot get the fuel allowance.I have raised this before and the Government has done nothing about it. These are vulnerable people, many of whom are sick and in a bad way. The Government is talking about what it has done. It has done nothing for these classes of people. Gas prices went up by 10% again yesterday and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made a submission against Shannon LNG, where we would perhaps have a hope of getting gas in from America, which wants to sell it to us, because soon we will not be able to get it from the Russians. Elderly people need heat in their homes to survive more so than younger people. They will perish in their homes if the Government does not act to help them. This mini-budget should reverse the decision to increase the carbon tax in budget 2022 and beyond until the full impact of the energy crisis is fully understood and a cost-benefit analysis is undertaken by whatever parliamentary means necessary, including new legislation if required. The mini-budget must reduce the excise duty on all motor fuel by at least 50% until the energy crisis abates, a proper and common-sense plan for rural public transport alternatives is put in place in every rural community and the purchase price point of electric cars is affordable to the ordinary motorist. The Government should not be trying to force people away from diesel or petrol cars until it has a reasonable and practical alternative, which the electric car is not at present. It must give over its codding. It knows it is wrong in that regard. People will adapt and change if it is practical. The mini-budget must reduce the excise duty on petrol, which is currently 62.77 cent per litre, and on diesel, which is 51.9 cent per litre, by at least 50% from now until the end of 2022. This alone would save approximately €18 on a €100 fill of petrol or diesel for the regular motorist. The mini-budget must reduce VAT on all motor fuels, electricity and home heating oil to below 5% until the end of 2022. I appeal to the Minister to do this. Otherwise, people cannot go on; they cannot continue indefinitely. As has been said in this Chamber, the price will shortly be more than €2 per litre. The Government will have to do something. It is not fair to continue insisting on a carbon tax just to please the Green Party and keep it onside. Government Deputies should think of the people who elected them in rural Ireland and the people who always voted for them. Those people are changing their minds and nothing will stop them from doing so.	spk_29

Good living people all over the world, in whatever country they are in, look up to the police. Instead of doing their job fairly and properly, police in Northern Ireland threw petrol on the flames at that time. The report has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was collusion at a high level between the RUC and loyalist paramilitaries. When we talk about the RUC, we can be sure that what happened went all of the way to the top, including whatever Ministers were in government at the time. They were and are responsible for what happened. When we talk about specific police or soldiers who carried out atrocities or were involved in them, politicians at the highest levels were certainly involved as well. When campaigning during the last election, Boris Johnson said that if he was elected he would grant an amnesty to former policemen. Our thoughts are with the families of those who lost family members or friends and relatives in this way. To deny justice in this way would cause further heartbreak to families, relatives and friends. After all, this happened only an hour up the road from us.	spk_419

It is not too long ago that a previous generation was involved in civil war and continuation of battle with the British until we got our own independence. As well as the trouble with Russia, there is a civil war threatening in Ukraine because there is a divide between the people. Some want to go with the east and others want to go West. We have to protect our neutrality. We have done that over the years, including de Valera during the Second World War. Everything worked out and he was right. We do not have a powerful Army to intervene. We have a wonderful Army that has provided a great peacekeeping service all over the world, including in Lebanon. We are very proud of them. We do not have an army to deal with this situation. I am sorry to see how dependent we are on Russia for fertiliser, fuel and gas. It is disappointing to think that the Government and Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has gone against a proposal to bring in gas by Shannon LNG.

I understand these assemblies will be appointed, as they have been before, by Government or parties in government. What credentials do they have to have? We know from the last assembly that at least nine of them did not meet the criteria to be on that so-called assembly. The local authorities and county councils do so much work on the ground listening to people's problems and complaints. Is this to sideline all those people who are elected? What will the people appointed to these assemblies cost? Who are they responsible to? They can go outside the Government remit or whatever criteria they were supposed to follow. Is this another ploy to satisfy former Government supporters and henchmen or women? Is it about giving them jobs and recognition and letting them come up with schemes and reports that may hurt farmers and working-class people?Our farmers are the custodians of the land. They have done right by their land all the time and always. I know them. They want to hand it down and on in a better state to the youngsters coming after them and whom we hope will be farming in future. Our farmers are the custodians of the land, in case anyone else tries to claim rights over it. We cannot hurt working-class people. These assemblies can and they are not responsible. Those people will never be looking for a vote. For Deputies here to say, like they did a short while ago, that we would not do the right thing because we were elected and we would be looking for votes is unfair and wrong.	spk_124

I am glad that Sinn Féin has at last seen the light, having voted for the carbon tax already. I am glad it has now seen the light and is against the carbon tax because it affects every man, woman and child in rural Ireland, including ordinary workers, people with cars going to work, commercial transport and lorries that are driven by grand honest people who cannot stay going. Farmers with tractors and other vehicles, school bus operators, taxis and hackneys are all being driven down through the ground with taxes. We can call it carbon tax, VAT or excise duty, but it is all tax on fuel. We cannot go to work or anywhere else without a car. We have no public transport, unlike in Dublin where there is one bus after another going around the corner with no one in half of them. We have no buses, no DART, no Luas and no trains. The last train went through Kilgarvan in 1959, I think. That is what I was told. That was last train the people of Kilgarvan saw. All the Government is intent on doing in sorting out people's problems today is to increase the carbon tax again in May. God almighty, do Ministers have any heart at all? Do they know what they are doing to people in rural Ireland? Do they know how they are suffering? They cannot fill their oil tanks or their car tanks. People do not know where to turn because they are being demonised and criticised. Farmers are being criticised daily for one thing and another. The cost of fertiliser has increased. There is no assistance from the Government.	spk_160

There is a scheme in place, the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, that provides relief from VRT and VAT for disabled people and disabled people's next of kin or drivers in order that they can take passengers in their vehicles. That scheme has been totally held up since before Christmas. The Minister of State knows there are 380 people on the list. Those people are prisoners in their own homes. I have heard from one elderly woman who needed a specially adapted vehicle, and in order for her to go to her appointment in a week's time we have to get an ambulance to take her there. That is how serious this has got. We have many people in the private sphere, such as taxi and hackney drivers, in Kenmare, Killarney and Tralee. I know one man, Teddy McCarthy of Sneem, who has two taxis suitable for people with disabilities. He purchased those vehicles in Sneem to help people in the locality. I ask the Minister of State to put the new appeals board in place. God damn it, if I cannot find someone to drive a vehicle, I must give up and park it. It is the same story with the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS. We cannot hire people. Surely if we cannot do so and if the HSE cannot put in place a system to deal with disabled people, the Government must give up, put its hands up and say it cannot do this and that it will have to find some other entity to take charge. If we as elected representatives cannot help disabled people, surely we must give up because the system is broken.

I thank Sinn Féin for facilitating this very important debate. I agree with the motion, but I have a different angle I wish to raise. We are talking about tackling the cost of living, which has gone up exorbitantly because of the cost of fuel - diesel, petrol and home heating oil. We know that this has gone up worldwide, but the tax take is bigger. The Minister has left the Chamber. The tax take has increased. I again ask the Government to forgo the increase and to give it back, so as to give working people a chance. People in rural Ireland have to travel to work and they must have a car in order to do that. Regardless of what the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, thinks about bicycles and other things, people need cars in order to get to work. Transport costs have gone through the roof. No heed has been given to the lorry men and the plight they are in. The diesel rebate should be increased, and the Government should forgo the extra tax. What is the Government trying to do but to raise the carbon tax again? Diesel costs for farmers have doubled. Fertiliser costs have trebled. Because the Greens hate the farmers, they will do nothing for them. God and his mother know that the cost of food will go up when the farmers' costs go up. I want to raise another thing. A poor old man rang me today. He rang the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, about the wonderful grants for heating homes. He asked what he was entitled to. The SEAI looked for his address and his date of birth. He was told that he got a grant for attic insulation about ten years ago and a grant to fill the cavity walls.

I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for his motion. Every man and woman, working or even not employed, is under savage pressure and the Government knows the reason for it. The cost of energy, the cost of travelling, the expense of diesel and petrol and home heating oil has gone up. Things are so extreme now. There was one way to deal with it, and that was not to add the carbon tax. The Government has a greater take of tax now from fuel than it had before the worldwide increase in oil prices came on. The Government's tax take is much greater. Other countries have reduced the amount of tax they are taking. They are not insisting on taking more carbon tax but the Government is held to ransom here. Its hands are tied behind its back by the Greens. They are not allowing it to touch or reduce the cost of energy. Farmers are paralysed and driven down into the ground with extra costs. It is as if this Government hates the farmer. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine could subsidise fertiliser and he could forego these anti-dumping levies but he will not do that because the Greens will not allow him. All the working class people are suffering then because if the farmers' production costs go up more they have to demand more for their produce. It is a merry-go-round. The Government could have it stopped and have helped a lot, but it has sat idly by. The Government has all these other plans now but there was one way of doing it - forget the carbon tax for now and drop the tax take.	spk_43

For far too long, the members of the Defence Forces have not received recognition for the work they do. We have only to look back on all the men and women from our Army who went to undertake peacekeeping duties in Lebanon and other places and where they put their lives in danger. For far too long, we heard that they were not being paid properly, had to sleep in cars and were getting income supplement payments. That kind of a situation which saw people working on behalf of the State not being paid properly and having to get an income supplement was disgraceful. In this case, the Women of Honour group issued a statement on Sunday, 6 February in which they said that the current review proposed by the Minister, Deputy Coveney ""will be ineffective and powerless to get to the real heart of the issues"". The group was commenting following reports of military police investigating an army officer. That is like putting the fox in charge of the chickens. I ask the Minister of State to have an independent public statutory inquiry and for the civil and criminal laws of the State to be applied to the Defence Forces, and especially in the cases of these women."	spk_278

I will be supporting it. I support everything that has been said so far. The family of Padraig and Elaine Clifford have paid a very high price, leaving four children behind them. This young couple died within four months of each other. I wish to highlight the plight of Karin O'Shea, a 27-year-old girl from Kilgarvan who is a personal friend of our family and best friends with my daughter, Theresa. I even brought her to school. This girl has gone around with Lyme disease undiagnosed for more than 12 years. The problem is that the Department does not recognise Lyme disease and will not accept results of blood tests from Germany or other countries. Testing in Ireland is inaccurate. We have only one Lyme disease consultant here. That individual can only offer antibiotics. Irish patients have no other option but to seek treatment abroad. Such treatment is not covered by the cross-border treatment abroad scheme because general practitioners here are not allowed to sign off on it. There is not enough education about ticks in Ireland. Many people are going around with undiagnosed Lyme disease. Not everyone comes out in a bull's eye rash. More must be done to educate people about other symptoms, like muscle pain, tiredness and headaches, because early diagnosis can make a big difference in curing this terrible disease. This lovely girl's whole life is in turmoil. She had to give up her job teaching at St. Brendan's College in Killarney. The cost of four weeks' treatment in Germany is €35,000 and she has embarked on a GoFundMe campaign to help her access this treatment.	spk_50

That was the saddest part of the whole thing. It should not have happened and I ask that it not be allowed to happen again, especially as visitors are being severely impeded from entering hospitals. Some people became seriously sick, such as Jim Tangney from the Black Valley, a naturally fit man, and Teddy O'Connor, who is still sick. The front-line workers did so much for everyone under a great deal of pressure. I am very disappointed with the plan for the leaving certificate and the way it was announced. The youngsters who missed so much should have been given a choice. They have been ringing me over and over again because they are very worried. I am concerned that this will create further problems. The Government made the wrong decision. I do not blame any individual, but the Government made the wrong decision. Students should be given a choice. Perhaps it is not too late. They are not happy in respect of this issue. Most unusual advice and guidelines were given by NPHET. For example, there was the restriction whereby people had to leave indoor public spaces by 8 p.m. I do not have time to comment further so I will leave it at that.	spk_300

We are educating children and pupils to the highest standard in our universities. I also welcome the Munster Technological University in Tralee, which is a big advantage. We needed it for so long and we are glad to have it since the beginning of last year. It is important for the vibrancy of Tralee and to facilitate youngsters from Kerry, Cork and the entire area. We are educating people to the highest standard but we do not seem to be able to hold on to them. There is a shortage of staff in every area. Whether it is doctors, nurses, teachers or whatever else, we seem to be losing people. They go abroad and we are lucky if some of them come back. Is it pay and conditions or what is the reason? We must get to the bottom of it. Recently, we learned that the HSE has been trying to appoint a senior consultant psychiatrist for south Kerry for over six years. That is not acceptable. What is wrong? Are we not educating people to qualified as consultant psychiatrists? As well as psychiatrists, we need psychologists. When youngsters are growing from boys and girls into men and women, there are physical changes but there are mental problems as well. It cannot be just a case of shoving a needle into them and giving them an injection or whatever they were being given. We have to talk to them and get to the root of the problem. We need more psychiatrists to deal with those cases. Our whole mental health system is a shambles. Surely the Government knows that. We need to get more people into apprenticeships and the trades and at the same time allow them to do night courses if they want to get an academic education or a master's degree. They should be able to do their apprenticeship first. There is nothing wrong with being a plumber, electrician, mechanic, plasterer or blocklayer. We need them. We should not look down on those people.There is an attitude now that people must go to university and perhaps not do those things. Maybe everybody is not suited to going to university. If they were working at home, it would be good for our rural areas. It would be good for them to mind their parents and families at home. They could be at home and work from home. As I said, not everyone is made for third level education. Some of the smartest people we know never went to university or college. The points system is the other aspect. There are people who really want to get into a certain course or whatever but the points system is all wrong. It is all about places and if there are more applications, the points go up. I have a few more things to say on the cost of getting a licence for a driver. We cannot get drivers, be they bus drivers or lorry drivers. The cost of getting licences is too high. Young people are being turned away because they do not have the funding and they are not getting help with it.	spk_310

I will vote for anything that will help the forestry sector, whether it is felling licences, planning licences or the building of roads. No farmer has any problem with planting small plantations of broadleaf. Farmers did not have to be told by the Green Party, or by anyone else for that matter, to do so. That has been happening over the years in corners of fields, haggards, around houses for shelter and different places. It has been done over the ages. Confidence in the forestry sector is totally and absolutely gone. People hear about the problems with the felling licences. Some people are getting felling licences, and I have no problem with that, but it should be fair across the board. The private foresters should be entitled to get their fair share of felling licences; that is not happening. In other countries, when someone plants a forest or plantation, the presumption is that it will be cut down when it is mature, when it is the right time and when it will make some financial sense to the owner. That is not being allowed to happen. I have heard of several cases where forestry was to be the source of funding to put a youngster through college. That has been lost. In another case, funding from forestry was to be used to make the house of a person who uses a wheelchair more accessible, with a new bathroom and improvements to the heating and other areas. That is not happening. It appears to me the green agenda is to plant no spruce and to fell no spruce. It is, rather, to plant broadleafs and forget about spruce altogether. That is the way it seems to me. The Minister has no idea of the frustration that even contractors are enduring at present. 	spk_345

He is suggesting that they do not have to apply for planning permission. I think they would do this anyway without the Minister telling them. Could they be helped with a grant? Could they get some funding towards this? Everything you do today costs money - plants and work. Is it the Green Party's intention as part of Government to subsidise or help these people to plant broadleaf trees?If there is not something like that coming down the line, what we are doing in here is wasting time. Farmers and landowners have been planting broadleaf trees since before we were here, going back to the foundation of the State. They were always doing it. They did not have to be told they could do it without planning.	spk_350

This is a new departure from fair play. Any criminal brought before any court enjoys the presumption of innocence until found guilty. What is suggested in the wording is wrong. It may seem small to argue about the wording but it is important to people whose heads are down at this time. This legislation does not solely affect fishers and all the grand people who came up the River Liffey to the convention centre last year. They gave a clear and precise presentation and no one repeated what anyone else said. It was a wonderful presentation and a joy to listen to. These are grand people who are trying to make a living. Look at what that exercise cost. These people would not do that only their backs are to the wall. They tell us they are only allowed to fish 16% of Irish waters. All the Government seems to do is offer them some compensation to get out of fishing. God almighty, there are traditions in those places where people were brought up to fish. If we went back to the 1600s, it was the English who taught us in the first place how to fish and now our own Government is telling fishers not to fish. We now have penalty points and the weighing of fish on the pier.It would be fair if foreign fishermen had to weigh on the pier too but why is it just the poor Irish fishermen? When we are hurting the fishermen we are also hurting their communities because it is all trí na chéile. If they make a pound, they spend it in the butcher's shop, the grocery shop, the clothes shop and so on. Rather than penalising them and victimising them, we should be joining together here to see how we can help them. That is what we should be doing rather than discussing the question of the balance of probability.  For God's sake, the Minister must look again at what he is doing and accept our amendment. He should at least agree to insert the words ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". I appeal to the Minister to see sense. We all saw what the former Leas-Cheann Comhairle did. He got out of his seat, went up to the back and annulled the statutory instrument but here we have it being introduced again, obliterating what the former Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher did. Fianna Fáil Deputies all voted for that, as did we. We all supported Pat the Cope Gallagher. He is from Donegal and knows the trouble that the fishermen are in. Likewise, we are close to the fishing people in Cahersiveen, Dingle, all along Kenmare Bay and in Castletownbere and we know they are hurting. They are looking at us in here tonight, asking the Minister and his Government to just change four words. I appeal to the Minister to do that."	spk_377

The purpose of us asking to use the words ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" is to provide fairness and equality for fishermen and women under the law and the Constitution, otherwise the Government will create a new and dangerous precedent of treating fishers as second-class citizens under the law.This would give power to a fisheries officer or office to make a judgment on the balance of probability, in other words, a 50 million to one probability that a potential infringement action had occurred.

These are hard-working people who pay their taxes. They are contributing to us in this Chamber and to services, whether those are carers, pensions or whatever. They are contributing like everyone else and they do not have surety of work. They are dependent on the weather as to whether they can go out to fish. We are asking the Minister to double the days to 60 because 30 days pass quickly. We are not long back after Christmas and the month of January is gone. The other problem the fishermen have is that when their quota is reached, at the end of the month or before it, they cannot go fishing for another few weeks.They are out again when the time comes because they have to make money to make payments to keep their vessels. They will not get paid if they are at home. They might have already spent a number of days at home because they had filled their quotas or the weather was bad. They go back out on the high seas to try to make a few pounds and the 30 days are stripping days. Thirty days pass quickly. It is only a small request to increase those 30 working days to 60 working days. Departmental officials certainly have a different idea of 30 working days. Sole traders who are operating on their own or as companies must pay their employees and they must work whatever days they can. That is often seven days a week and, many times, 24 hours a day. That has to be understood and I do not think it is being understood. I humbly ask the Minister for this. I ask him to tell me why he cannot make this adjustment if he will not do it. How would it hurt the process for it to carry on for another 30 days? I ask the Minister to explain that to me. All they are asking is for a period of 60 days to allow a submission in writing to be made to the determination panel from the date of the notification from the SFPA. We could not be more humble or ask for anything smaller than what we are asking for. We are asking the Minister to double the time limit. I do not think it would be the end of the world. I ask the Minister to explain how it would damage the SFPA's case if the time limit was increased to 60 days.	spk_405

I appeal to all those who know anything about people who have been lost, buried or disappeared to come forward. Both communities, South and North, need to work together to advance agriculture, industry, tourism and the provision of gas and electricity. Trade is important at this time. We in Kerry appreciate northern buyers coming to buy cattle. Michael Kissane does outstanding work at Cahersiveen mart. There are also marts in Castleisland and Kenmare. Since Brexit, there are delays and extra costs for parts for special machinery. They sometimes cost two or three times the previous amount.

I will start by apologising to the parents and those lovely boys and girls who were harmed and not treated properly by the HSE. Those youngsters and parents did nothing wrong. I have to reiterate that they did absolutely nothing wrong. They sought help and did not get it. Some 1,332 children were not dealt with properly. Were it not for locum doctor consultant psychologist, Dr. Ankur Sharma, who raised the alarm about multiple medications to young mental health patients, how much longer would this have gone on? One would think that when there was only a locum and not a senior consultant in place, management would have been more hands-on and managed what was going on. Paul Reid, who suggested there would be criminal investigations, should include himself. He gets approximately €420,000 and all he does is read out figures on the television every night. Any public relations person could do that. His job should be to monitor every last thing going on in the HSE on the ground. The Irish Medical Council will draw up a report. Will it be influenced by the HSE? I have heard too often from hardworking nurses and carers who are afraid to open their mouths about any inadequacies in the HSE in the hospitals or any of the care facilities. Why are they afraid? They would be ostracised or maybe lose their jobs and they still work hard. That is very wrong and that culture must be rooted out and stopped, because that is what is going on.

People in rural Ireland may not have the opportunity to provide ten children. They have one, two or three children, and their neighbours might have two or three, but if they do not have ten children they cannot start the run. That is very unfortunate in light of the promise that was given when the local school was closed that children would be taken free of charge to the central school.

I did this before on 3 November last. I want to know what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach and the Government have done to get the price of fertiliser down to an acceptable or reasonable price for small suckler farmers in south Kerry and for dairy producers and tillage farmers in mid and north Kerry. This time last year urea was €330 a tonne. It is now €930 a tonne. Nitrogen was €240 and is now €690. Pasture sward was €350 and is now €700; and 18:6:12 is now €790. One farmer had a bill of €7,000 last year, but it will be €17,000 this year. Farmers will go broke and fast, especially small farmers in Kerry. The main driver of the increased fertiliser costs in the EU and here is the massive increase in natural gas prices due to the green agenda to decarbonise electricity generation and also the EU policy to protect EU fertiliser producers by imposing levies on Russia and other countries supplying fertiliser into the EU. I am calling on the Taoiseach to intervene with the EU and get these levies abolished. Last Wednesday I attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and with others asked Fabien Santini of the EU Agriculture Commission what could be done to help our farmers in Kerry and around the country. From his reply we understand that each member state will be allowed to provide unique farmer support through relaxation of the state aid framework. This facility is only allowed until June this year. At that meeting, the Green Party Deputy Brian Leddin outlined his pleasure at the increased cost of fertiliser to force crippled farmers into organising farms. Is the Green Party preventing the Taoiseach from helping the farmers? If the Taoiseach cannot do something about fertiliser costs, in order to survive farmers will have to increase the cost of their products to the consumer. Otherwise, they will go bust. We all have been told recently that the cost of groceries to the housewife has gone up by €780 in the last year. This figure will go up by double or more in the coming year because of the farmers' increased cost of production. Are housewives and consumers prepared to pay the extra cost of food as a result of the badly thought out policies of the Green Party and this Government? This will also impact on the availability of fodder and increase its price. Farmers have been wrongly attacked and vilified by the Green Party and many others in this Chamber and outside of here, and are being blamed for everything even though they produce good healthy food of the highest quality while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, abiding by all the Department and European regulations.	spk_184

I am asking him to ensure that the anti-dumping levy is withdrawn. That would account for at least €40 or €50 per tonne. I am asking the Government to subsidise the cost of the fertiliser. If we look far enough ahead, we will see that the current situation will increase the cost of food as well. If the cost to the farmer of what he or she produces increases, who will pay for it only the consumer? The Dáil has heard all day from other parties and Members that the cost of living, including the cost of diesel and everything else, has increased. The cost of food will go mad if the Government does not do something about it. The current situation will also create a fodder crisis at the end of the year. Farmers cannot afford it. I will give an example of a man whose bill was €7,000 last year. It will be €17,000 this year. That is savage for a small farmer trying to survive.

I have also been contacted by many people, including friends from Donegal and Mayo, who asked me to ensure the Government gives 100% compensation to these people whose houses are falling down around them. Many of these people do not know where they will be next Christmas night or if they will be with their families. This is going on long enough. I support Deputies Dillon, Calleary, McHugh and Mac Lochlainn, and I am sure the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has made representations. I add my voice to the request of these people that they get 100% compensation so they can rebuild their houses. At the same time as the material in question was provided for these houses, material from the same company was taken across the Border to Derry. I am far away from those places but I am told there has been no problem across the Border in Derry. What has gone wrong in Donegal or Mayo, as well as Clare and other places where many people are suffering the same problem? With regard to this Bill, I ask that the Government does not put any more obstacles in front of a man or woman trying to build their own house and doing the work themselves. They might work on a house after coming home from their job in the evening. There should not be any more obstacles that would impede them from building their own house. There is another problem. Even when somebody gets planning permission, the banks give mortgage approval for just three months. They might stipulate that 80% of savings must be spent on the house. It is not very easy to get everything to happen within three months but what do they make people do after? They make people apply for the mortgage all over again, leading to another delay. It is absolutely ridiculous. Has the Government any power over the banks with the interest it has in them? It should say something to them about having common sense. If people are approved for a mortgage once, why should they have to get it two or three times? God damn it but it does not make any sense. Where are the planning guidelines that have been promised for five or six years? I have heard the Minister of State talking about planning even on our local Kerry radio sometimes and there are problems down there. Land is being dezoned in rural towns and villages. Councils want to zone more in bigger towns but developers will buy those sites; meanwhile, the man who wants to buy a site and build a house cannot get planning permission. There is the other issue of urban-generated pressure. A person might want to buy a site from a neighbour, having lived beside that neighbour all his life. If the territory is in what is known as urban-generated pressure, he would not be allowed to build. If the neighbour on the other side owns the land, or the father owned the land, he could build. These two people might have gone to school together, perhaps in the same car or walking to school together. One can get permission but the other cannot. It is absolutely ridiculous. Going back a few years, there was a planning case in Belgium. Ms Maura Healy-Rae asked last week in Kerry County Council, by way of a motion, whether the local authority was acting illegally by insisting that people must be from a certain area in order to get planning permission. This happened a good number of years ago. Will the Government do anything about this and are we acting illegally in this country? Belgium is in Europe the same as us. There is talk of building houses and that so many houses will be built but we have no sewerage system in many of our towns and villages in Kerry, including in Kenmare, Castleisland and Kilcummin. Something will have to be done about objectors because they have people tormented and tortured down through the ground.	spk_469

I ask the Minister to please give these students a choice this year because they have been through a tough time. We should remember that these students did not sit the junior certificate exam.

This baby pain relief Bill is crucial to ensure that any baby with a heartbeat does not have to endure or feel pain while being aborted or killed and denied the right to make their way into this world. There are several other pressing problems and issues we should be highlighting on behalf of communities that are let down and under constant attack from the three Government parties. They concern people who need medical interventions, farmers, hauliers, working-class people whose incomes are diminishing daily and people who cannot even go to work because of Covid. If we are to be worth our salt in the Dáil, we have to stand up for those who cannot defend or talk up for themselves. We have to stand up at Christmastime, the time of peace and goodwill, for these defenceless babies. They are God's creatures who cannot defend themselves. They have done nothing wrong to anyone. They were conceived naturally, like each of us, but they are not to be allowed to live. To top it all, they have to endure pain while they are being discarded from this life. They are being hurt in the process of ending their little lives. I call on the Minister and the Government to do everything possible to ensure pain relief is administered to each baby with a beating heart. I do not subscribe to the notion that it should be only those babies over 20 weeks gestation. Every baby with a beating heart should not have to feel pain. There is no difference between a baby over 20 weeks and a baby under 20 weeks. They are all human beings to me. God created them, they are alive and they should not be discounted like this. This has been asked for since abortion was legalised but there has been a refusal to extend a morsel of compassion to these babies as they breathe their last breath in this world. This is the most forceful and condemning evidence that we are losing our empathy and our way as a society. Recent scientific evidence concludes that unborn babies feel pain as early as 12 weeks and maybe sooner. To ignore this is reckless. Indeed, unborn babies that are to be born in the natural way and are going to be allowed to live in the normal way are looked on by baby surgeons as their patients and are administered pain relief medication as standard medical practice. There are medical interventions to stop the pain and to numb the pain. Pain relief for animals is provided for in primary legislation and properly so. The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 provides that veterinarians administer pain relief during any procedures or interventions that would cause pain to the animal. Surely we must ensure that unborn babies with a heartbeat are dealt with in a compassionate way and give them pain relief. If there is any humanity in the Government I ask why it is putting down an amendment to a Bill as harmless as this. Is it just because it wants to oppose ordinary people who want to stop children, little babies, having pain in this way? It is such a small thing to ask. We should be asking that they be let live but at this stage, because of the abortion laws that were passed, this is all we can ask for. We are asking for more heart, that the Government does what we ask and please help little babies that have done nothing wrong to anyone in this world. If the Government does not help these, I cannot see how it will help anyone at all that it is supposed to be helping while its members are in government. There were 6,666 children aborted in the first year after the legislation was changed. These little children are an awful loss to our country and to our community. I had the pleasure of having a young granddaughter, Bríd Healy-Rae, five weeks ago. To think that anyone would harm her or cause her pain would drive me down through the ground. I have five grandchildren and I adore each and every one of them. We need to do more to help mothers, and fathers, indeed, to ensure there is another way. We are not doing that. Many here were hell-bent on ensuring that the abortion legislation went through. That was their right and for those who voted for it that was their right. But that is not to say that I say it is right. I think that these children, if they grew up, and they do grow up and they are not long becoming men and women, would have been a massive asset to this country. The Government, by its amendment, is looking to delay this. I want to remind the Minister that 18 babies are being aborted daily so they are going to suffer pain. It is 126 weekly and over 6,000 in a year. Surely we should not be wasting time. Is there humanity in the Minister or any of the Government? If there is, now is the time to stand up and do what we ask which is just to administer pain relief in the course of these abortions where we are ending little babies lives. 	spk_25
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-12-15	dail	33	Animal Health and Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Instruction to Committee	dbsect_14	I hear the Ministers talking about planting native trees but they have the forestry industry finished. For a long time, it thought it was the case that Department officials were lagging. Others thought that objectors were causing the delay in the issuing of felling licences. However, I now honestly feel that it is the Government and these Ministers that have the whole thing completely finished. I always say what it is in my head and I honestly believe the Ministers do not want spruce to be cut, planted or re-planted anywhere and that this is totally contrary to their will. It goes against the grain for them. I have nothing against native trees but we need commercial timber as well. We are now so far behind in issuing felling licences that the price of timber has increased to an unacceptable level which is preventing people from building houses. A 6 inch by 3 inch stick of timber that was €20 for many years is now €38. It is the same with every other type of commercial timber. The prices have practically doubled. This is having a detrimental effect. I honestly believe the Ministers do not understand the value of spruce. We are told that an acre of spruce sequesters 13 tonnes of carbon. Native trees take much longer to grow. As I have said, I have nothing against native species but we have to be real about this. These species only sequester 4 tonnes per acre. The Ministers have not made one iota of a difference to the felling licence situation or helped it in any way. I have lost faith in them. We have spoken about this a great deal but we are still where we were. People have walked away from planting trees because they see what is happening to the people who want to cut down trees, in some cases because they want the money for real things like sending children to college. I know of a man who became immobilised and wanted to do up his house and put it in order so that he could manage a wheelchair in it. He does not have any money because he cannot get a felling licence. He also cannot get permission to build a road. I have always said that when you plant a crop, whether barley, oats, spuds or whatever, there must be an ideology that it will be cut down when it is ripe. That has to be the same for forestry. They would replant the trees but they cannot because they cannot get a felling licence to cut them. With regard to wild animals, I concur with Deputy Canney from Galway. It was sad to hear some of the comments made about us when we were trying to do something about pain relief for little babies. They are human beings and creatures of God. Not only did some people not want to hear about the little babies, but they do not want to hear about God either because many of them think they themselves are God and that they do not have to worry about anything. Their day will come, as will everybody else's. On the issue of wild animals, we are completely overrun with deer in Kerry. Our roads are not safe. At 7.15 the other morning, a deer ran out in front of a youngster who had gone to the trouble of getting his driving test, buying a car and getting expensive insurance, and it made flitters of his car, which he gave a lot of money for. He is finished now. He cannot go to work because his car has been put out of action before it really got going at all. Something has to be done about the deer because they have our side of the country totally overrun. The roads are not safe. They are eating farmers out of house and home. We are talking about there not being any fertiliser next year. For many farmers, there was no good in putting it out anyway because the deer got the benefit of it. Foxes need to be brought under control in some way as well. Many here may not realise what happens when a lamb or a couple of lambs are taken by a fox. It is absolutely horrible. That is devastating for sheep farmers who work hard and who have to traverse mountains, glens and valleys to look after their sheep. Every year, 30 or 40 sheep out of every flock finish up without a lamb because of foxes. That is the gospel truth. I do not know if the Minister understands that. We are completely overrun. There needs to be some policy or Government action taken to deal with the deer and the foxes, and more so the deer because people are being hurt and killed. A mother of three children was killed coming into Killarney within a half a mile of the centre of the town. That is the gospel truth. We need to do something about real issues. This is the Minister's time. They are the Ministers at this time, although I do not know for how long. If they want to prove their worth, they must do something about these issues.	spk_131
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-12-15	dail	33	Appropriation Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_16	Part of the Bill relates to ensuring money can be rolled over from projects that are not completed or carried out in the current year and transferred to the following year. I am putting in my stake in respect of any moneys left over. There are 676 local improvement schemes on a list below in Kerry. Last year, 11 of them were done and 19 were done this year. It is totally unfair on those people. Of the 676 schemes, there are 90 or so old applications going back as far as 2006 or 2007 that were lumped in with the applications submitted in 2018. That is very wrong. Many of them are still waiting.I ask that any money hanging around should be directed to the local improvement schemes in Kerry. There is another aspect of the local improvement scheme that was called an emergency hardship scheme. It related to roads used by nurses, doctors or home help personnel to visit a patient. That scheme would help those people but for the past four or five years we have not got a bob for those kinds of roads. We are in dire straits. I know money cannot be left behind so I am in favour of the Bill if the Government ensures it directs any money left over towards two schemes, which are the local improvement and emergency hardship schemes. I would appreciate such action on behalf of the people of Kerry.	spk_149

I thank the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach for this opportunity to speak. The first thing I wish to raise with the Minister is the issue of masks which have been ordered in for children in schools. Many parents are very hurt and concerned because even yesterday morning and this morning, many mothers have spoken to me to say that they cannot get the exemption letter from their doctors. As the Members may know, doctors in Kerry are very busy and sick elderly people are even waiting for appointments. It can take anything up to a week to be seen by a doctor if one has an ailment in Kerry. Many of our GPs are very busy. They will not give a letter exempting a child from wearing a mask because of asthma and all of the other ailments. One child has breathing difficulties and had Covid-19 a number of weeks ago. I do not know if the Minister is listening and if he is not I have no business talking then.	spk_20
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-12-02	dail	33	Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_2	That is all right but this is very serious. The Government has not spoken to the GPs and I am being told that no one has given them direction. They are only hearing about these requests on the radio, the media, the television, or whatever and that is not fair to that profession. These are professional people doing a professional job and they are at the pin of their collar to look after their communities and sick people. The Minister for Education said clearly yesterday on Radio Kerry that children over nine years of age cannot go into school unless they are wearing a mask or they have a letter of exemption. That is where the trouble is because the parents are not able to get the letter of exemption.If they can get one it takes time to get it. An understanding has to be arrived at with the GPs to ensure that children and parents are not disenfranchised because children's health has to be prioritised. Their need for education has to be recognised as well. I am in a difficult spot because I wanted to raise more things, although they might have been raised already. The following matter was not raised by Members. I want to ensure that families can go into hospitals and nursing homes to visit their sick relatives. Many elderly people have died after spending a number of weeks in hospitals and nursing homes without visitors. There must be some way that visitors can dress up in the same manner as the nurses and go in. Exceptions must be made to provide for visitors to go in and see the people who are in nursing homes or hospitals. That has to be done. It is unfair that people who gave their lives to this country and brought us to where we are die alone, are sick alone or stay in nursing homes alone without visitors. I do not want us to arrive at that situation because that is unfair on these people. I will leave it at that and I will be listening to the replies of the Minister and the Minister of State.	spk_22
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-12-02	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_3	I am glad to get the opportunity today to raise this and ask the Tánaiste for increased funding to deal with local improvement scheme applications in Kerry next year. It is only just around the corner. Some 678 schemes are on the list and were applied for in 2018. More than 90 of them are on a list since 2007 and were included in the 2018 scheme. These are public roads which were never taken in charge by the local authority. They are not private roads. Some 20 or more homes are on many of these roads and nine or more farmers are using them on a daily basis to access their homes. We got an increased allocation of approximately €480,000 last year which brought us up to €1,187,099. We got 19 roads done last year, to a high standard, by Kerry County Council, which does a very good job. However, there has been no element of funding for emergency hardship schemes which was always made available through the local improvement scheme, LIS. The people who live on these roads pay all their taxes; road, property, PAYE and income tax.They pay their way and they have no public transport. Farmers pay water charges and have to pay more to get their cars through the NCT because of damage and more wear and tear on bad roads. All I ask on behalf of the people of Kerry is fair play. Smaller counties with fewer applications are getting more funding to do their roads. I will not name them as I do not want to put any other county down to put Kerry up. I ask for fairness for the people of Kerry. I ask the Government to be fair to people in these rural areas. People living on these roads are entitled to good roads to their door, the same as people in Dublin 4. These roads are not private; they are public. There are carers, nurses and doctors using them to get to people who are sick on a daily basis or several times a day to keep people living at home. This is a serious matter. They have no option other than to use these roads. They want to stay living in these places as long as they can but we must do our bit to help them. Over the years, the Department made 80% of the funding available. They will pay their contribution. They have never refused to do so. I thank the Tánaiste.	spk_40

Kerry County Council has the capacity to deal with any funding that is left over and all the Deputies from Kerry will work together. I have raised this matter several times. If we only get 19 roads done every year, it will take us 35 or 36 years to get through the 678 roads left on the list. There are places like Kilcummin, Gneeveguilla, Scartaglin, Currow, Currans, Farranfore and Firies and all around south Kerry with multiple roads to be dealt with. These people need fair play. They pay everything they are asked to pay. I named out all the taxes they pay. They need assistance and fair play. Urban areas have all different modes of transport and fine roads but these people are left behind. Since 2007, there are 90 of these. If we have to wait 38 years, I will not be around. Deputy Griffin might, but many of us here will not be there if it takes that long. I ask for fair play. Other counties are doing better and we have to come up the line.	spk_42

It is fine to talk about schools in the context of the Bill but that aspect is being used to bring the same regulations into businesses. That is my worry. Private businesses, the small employers, are struggling to cope with every kind of an increase in the cost of insurance and fuel to keep workplaces warm. If such a measure were to be introduced, we need to know the cost of it and how much per square foot or square yard it would cost employers to put these measures in place. I note the Bill includes the words ""to provide for health and safety inspectors to take CO2 measures"". That is all fine but who will foot the bill? Many businesses are in trouble and barely managing to carry on after the long lockdowns they have endured and are now trying to get going again. I support the aspect of the Bill dealing with ventilation systems for schools. As has been said, children are cold in school at present. The Government said schools were safe and now to top it off it is insisting children aged nine and over will have to wear masks in school. That will be hard for many children who may have health issues. We all remember the way it was in schools in the past. The generation before us had to bring a sod of turf with them to keep the schools warm. That is not needed with the heating systems in place now but the doors and the windows are open and that is not acceptable. The Government will have to address the ventilation systems in schools. It must take that on board and ensure children are not impacted in terms of being vulnerable to getting more bouts of flu, colds or pneumonia. I support that part of the Bill but I need more assistance regarding what will happen or who will pay for these ventilation systems in the workplace."	spk_55

In our area you must have an appointment with a doctor. The doctor will not give this letter of exemption otherwise, and that will cost parents money they do not have at present.

I appreciate the urgency and the number of people who are looking for housing. I know there is a very real problem and that his number one consideration is to deal with that and to get the numbers down. I raised an issue here in the Dáil with the Taoiseach a week or two ago. I was grateful for the Minister's response at the time but it is not the response I want. Heretofore, there were always extensions of five years to planning permissions for one-off housing. That is now being ruled out. I ask him to reconsider that because many people who got planning permission now find that their time is now running out because they were not able to build during the coronavirus pandemic or because they were not able to get loans for one reason or another. Work has not been great and some were not able to get going. Such people now face another conundrum because materials have become so expensive that many will not be able to start building their houses for the foreseeable future. There is also a scarcity of contractors. There are many different problems. Perhaps the Minister does not know but there is an awful problem with getting planning permission for one-off houses in rural Ireland. People can get over all the hurdles, provide further information when sought and have their permission duly granted only for the application to be appealed to An Bord Pleanála. It is now the case that 90% of decisions appealed to An Bord Pleanála are overturned. Even if the inspector who comes down is of the view that the permission should be upheld, what do the members of the board do, people who have never been down in Kerry, but refuse the permission? Most of these objections and appeals are vexatious. We are now going to put people who have planning permission through that rigmarole again.  I appreciate that the Minister wants to get big sites here in Dublin going but this is affecting the ordinary person in rural Ireland who wants to put a roof over his or her head and who will only be doing this once in his or her lifetime. I understand what is happening here in Dublin. It is a different scenario. People get planning permission for a site and then hold that site until they see the time is right and sell it off. The next owner may do something else with the planning permission. They may increase the density and make the site more valuable. That is holding things up and I appreciate that but the scenario I am outlining to the Minister is totally and absolutely different. I ask him to change that.  Surely this issue is affecting Deputies in other rural counties, such as Clare. This five-year extension must have been available there as well. I ask the Minister to look at that again because it will hurt people. I know he wants people to build homes but this will stop people doing so. They cannot get going right now because they cannot get loans or meet the current exorbitant building costs. Some are trying to get on their feet because they have not been working for a couple of years. There are many other little reasons, although they are big reasons for the people who are being held up. They would not have sought planning permission in the first place if they had known these things would arise. These sites are for themselves. They are not sites for sale or anything like that but sites to build a house on. People want to put a roof over their own heads and young couples want a place to rear their families. Such families may be needed to keep local schools going because numbers are going down in rural areas. I represent and adore people in places like Shrone. These areas need people to build houses around their schools. There are several other such places.  There are also other issues. From time to time, local authorities have zoned lands around towns and villages that belong to farmers and other landowners who have no notion of ever selling these lands or building houses on them. Zoning these lands makes them more valuable and the owners have to pay more stamp duty on them. That has to be looked at as well. These people cannot be forced to build houses on land they never wanted to sell in the first place.What I honestly believe, even regarding land here in Dublin, is that there should not be any such thing as zoning. Let every applicant apply for planning permission and let that be decided on the merits of the place involved. I refer to all this wasting time with zoning land, and all the time it takes. Let applicants, whether the land is zoned or not, apply for planning permission and let every case be decided on its own merits. That is the real way of building houses.	spk_279

Their situation is bad enough as it is. It cannot make their situation any worse. When one sees how expansive Ireland's shores are, we realise how far-reaching the Bill will be. The sea is all around us. One can barely think of what is involved because there is so much involved, especially with our piers and harbours. People hope the Bill will not impinge on people's rights in using the sea, which they have been doing in different ways to make a living. We must also consider people in the tourism business such as those who run the small boats that take people out for tours of the bay. We hope this will not mean anything will change for them, only to improve things. Included in the Bill is provision for dredging piers and harbours. The nearest pier to me is Kenmare. It is a beautiful place all around it, but I feel that it could be developed way more. The pier has not been cleaned out for nearly 70 years. The slag boats came into Kenmare up until 1960 or 1962, but they could not get in there now because the pier is badly in need of dredging. That needs to be looked at. I am sure there are other places apart from Kenmare with similar issues, but Kenmare pier is the nearest one to me. I gave a lot of my time on the edge of the pier working for Kerry County Council, even with cleaning of the seaweed along the pier. I hope that this will be included if the Bill is to be effective to help our local situation. This place is only 50 m away from the top of Kenmare town. If the pier was dredged it would have a massively positive impact for the town and for places local to the town. The pier itself should be developed and modernised to allow more boats to come in during the summer. The River Roughty cannot get out at the pier when the mouth of the bay is blocked, and then we are talking about flooding, and it is said that climate change is causing it. There are a lot of things that used to be done before that are not done at all now, including dredging of our rivers and dredging the mouths where the rivers run into a bay. Those things also need to be looked at.	spk_314

I thank the Minister for giving this €88 million. The only regret I have is it is a reduction of €8 million from last year. We all know the cost of everything is going up. Why do we have to come in here every year to approve this spending? Should there not instead be a standing order that the horse racing and greyhound industries would get their money every year? I ask that because these industries return these funds back to the coffers in abundance. It has been said horse racing accounts for some 29,000 jobs, while the doggy people provide 12,000 and are working very hard with their dogs. They treat them very well. It was sad the industry got a bit of a bad name for a while because of a few rogues, but 99% of these people are genuine. They live for their dogs and their communities and they make a serious contribution to rural Ireland.

I will be supporting this motion. I honestly feel the services we have are good enough. While perhaps at times they could have been better, I am very worried that what we will get will be worse. When something is for profit, I am afraid the people who will suffer are those who are on the margins and seeking employment in trying to get going. We know how people are fixed after the virus and the lockdowns. Many people who had not recovered from the breakdown of the economy in 2008 and 2009 still need assistance. I put it to the Minister that if something is working well enough, why do we not leave it alone? I give as an example Turas Nua, a company that was employed to deal with people in trying to get them back to work. In reality it was about getting people off the dole, regardless. It made it impossible for them. I know of one young man who was about 30 miles from Tralee out on the side of a hill at Knocknagashel. He had to thumb every Monday morning from his house, along the side of the main and dangerous road where many people have been killed, and go into Tralee to present himself, prove what he had been doing and who he had asked for employment. This went on for more than 12 months. Many people would not understand the torture this poor young fellow went through, only if they stood where he left to go into Tralee every Monday morning. I believe the Government should now abandon the plans to privatise local employment services. Staff currently employed in these centres are understandably extremely very about the possibility of losing their jobs. It will also see an end to people walking in without a referral. Many people do not have a referral and that is how some of the services worked.The Minister has said it is open to local employment services and job clubs to tender for the new model. The majority, however, will be priced out of this tendering service. We have seen in the past where privatisation of job activity services like the disastrous JobBridge The local employment service is and was a vital service in communities throughout the country and is a far more holistic service than the standard profit-driven employment service.	spk_331

Obviously, I do not agree with many parts of what the Deputy has said. He said that modern Ireland needs to stop using religion as a method to deliver relationship and sex education. The country, the parents and the children have been managing for decades and for generations without any direction that says religion should not be involved. I am proud to be a Catholic and will openly admit to it but I also respect every other religion, be it Muslim, Protestant or whatever, as well as those who have no religion. I respect each and every one of them. The delivery of sex education, however, in the first instance must be given by parents. Parents have been doing this for generations and they are doing it today as well as ever. I realise that children are developing at a younger age. I am aware that parents know this also. Young people have their phones and access to computers and maybe they get a lot of bad direction from some of those sources. A parent knows when a child is developing and at what stage the child needs the education. I believe the parents are the first source. In the formative years, it is very important that parents recognise the need. They do that and they have been doing that. I do not believe that we need one line inside the schools telling children that they should not be of any religion, and maybe directing them in a certain way. That would be wrong. I cannot support this Bill. Parents are the best people to know when children are developing at a certain age and be with them in their formative years. They are the best ones to know. We must recognise our religion, or whatever religion it is, and we must respect other people who have other views.	spk_55

I am sure he will be back in action very shortly. Up to 9 September 2021, planning permissions were for five years. Prior to that date, it was possible for young people and other people wishing to build a one-off house to apply for an extension of a further five years. Under Housing for All, brought forward by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, this aspect of planning has been changed and people are no longer able to get an extension for a further five years. Many young people have run into trouble in that because they were not able to work last year and earlier this year, they cannot get mortgages. Other people have been hit by the increase in the cost of living and the cost of building materials. I am asking the Taoiseach to ensure that this change which, I am sure, happened inadvertently, is reversed. We need the availability of an extension for a further five years to be reinstated as currently many in rural Ireland are being denied it.	spk_92

Yet our farmers, who produce the highest quality food from fresh grass, are being blamed by the environmentalists. Deputies in this House and the media, including RTÉ, are blaming the transport sector. Yet there is no blame for coal producers in Romania, China and Colombia. The Government has stopped us burning turf and timber and one Fine Gael Deputy said people should be penalised for selling turf and timber. The Minister should remember that we are all under the one sky. He does not realise that and he is trying to paralyse the people who are working.

I was too late to sign the motion, but my heart is in it. This has been a terrible time in the history of our State. It is 11 months since the commission of investigation delivered its final report. The payment scheme was finally published on Tuesday, 16 November. The payment involves an €800 million redress payment for 34,000 survivors of mother and baby homes and county homes. However, we know from the response of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in the Dáil last week that an estimated 58,000 survivors of mother and baby homes are alive today. This means that the compensation scheme will not be available to 24,000 other survivors, including babies and women who were in these homes. These women were treated shabbily from the start by parents, religious orders, different Governments and health boards.Many babies died from neglect and not getting the medical care or interventions that would have kept them alive. Clearly, for the religious orders in the mother and baby homes, the money that they made was more important to them than keeping babies alive. Many babies were taken from their mothers and sold into adoption. Can you imagine that? Last year, the Government tried to keep the records from those trying to contact sons or daughters and, likewise, sons and daughters trying to find their mothers, and stated that they had been destroyed. It must be a divine right that a child is not impeded from finding out the identity of his or her mother or father. No arm of the State should in any way impede a person trying getting that information, if available. What happened to the babies in Tuam by way of mass burial in a septic tank was absolutely terrible. I watched the RTÉ programme a week or so ago. It was horrific. The Government now wants survivors to put their signatures to what it is offering them by way of redress and is trying to ensure that there can be no further claims. This tells me that the Government knows that what it is offering is in no way adequate. Why else would it be trying to get survivors to sign on the dotted line? The scheme provides that unless a person was resident in a mother and baby home for more than six months prior to his or her being adopted out, no redress will be payable. Who decided that a child would have to have been in a mother and baby home for six months or more? A group of women contacted me in the past few days. They were outraged because one of them was in Bessborough for four months and another was there for five. They are being denied any redress. I would like to meet the person who set that time limit. Those who were boarded out to other homes are also not entitled to redress. The Government is not even halfway there. It must do right and be seen to do right. It must rectify the wrong that has been done. A savage wrong has been done to these survivors. It is wrong that people would be left out regardless of whether they were there for a short period or for much less than six months. I cannot understand how the Government thinks it is going to get away with this. What is on offer is not adequate. I appeal to the Minister to look at this again and ensure that all survivors, male or female, are looked after properly. The manner in which the Government is going about this in terms of requiring these people to sign on the dotted line that they are happy with what they are getting leaves me in grave doubt as to what it is doing. I am very worried about it and I cannot stand over it. I ask the Minister to look at the matter again. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on behalf of these misfortunates who have been treated so badly in our State, and by many people in our State, and not that long ago. Many of them are still alive. I am asking the Minister to look at this again. I am not shouting or roaring; I am appealing to him to look at this in a fair way because what is happening in regard to the nine people who were in the homes for less than six months is wrong. I appeal to the Minister to look at this again and to do what is right for those survivors. Now is the time; do not let it pass. Do not delay because many of these people are on their last legs. Medical cards should be awarded to each and every one of them to ensure that while they did not get proper medical treatment at the time they were born into these homes, they will at least get it for the remaining days of their lives. I appeal to the Minister to do that.	spk_216

As I look around me, I see a few people who I know are sane but this House is the most lunatic place in the world at the present time. This is a good piece of blackguarding, to try to get people to pay more for their produce and to try to get producers to get involved in intricate actions to try to account for their carbon footprint. At the same time, this Government cannot put a process in place to measure the carbon that farmers are sequestering. The Government has said that this will not happen until 2027 but now we are being told that we need a carbon footprint label for the products on the shelves, including information on how they got there. It is totally and absolutely unfair. At the same time, the Government is importing peat from Latvia and briquettes from Germany. What is their carbon footprint? The Government put a working group in charge of the provision of peat for horticulture, which has recommended the resumption of peat harvesting next year up until 2030 or 2035, until a suitable viable alternative is found. It is critically important that this happens to save the 17,000 jobs in the horticultural industry. Dr. Munoo Prasad sent his report to the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, on 20 October last. Where is that report and when is the Government going to act on it? Is the Government going to keep people in the horticultural business in suspense? That is what is going on and now we have this Labour Party Bill, which is supported by Sinn Féin. Some Sinn Féin Deputies say they will vote in favour of the Bill but then they are critical of its contents. As Tom Mike from Kilgarvan would say, if you try to sit on two stools, you will fall down between them. That is what will happen to the Sinn Féin Deputies if they carry on with this. They cannot fool the people by trying to carry the two sides of the road. That is what they are doing here and the Labour Party is trying to suggest that we put more expense on the consumer and more work on the producer-----	spk_38

I am glad the deadline of 30 November has been set aside. I called for this when I was first elected to the House in early 2016. I also called for it numerous times this year here in the Chamber. I told the Taoiseach that things were not working as they should as a result of Covid and the coronavirus and asked him at least to extend the deadline to account for that period. This is better. The Government is going to do something more and I appreciate that. I realise it will not be very easy. The deadline was wrong in many ways. First, not everyone knew about it. Those who did were very worried about it and did not know what to do. Whatever rules are made next June, they need to be publicised so that everyone will know about them. There needs to be a lot of interaction in here, out there and everywhere to ensure that we get it right. Whether determined by long usage, which we are now reverting to for the interim period, or by another method, there will be people today, tomorrow and every other day seeking to rectify their situations. I know of an incident where a Dublin couple bought a house in rural Kerry and, after six or seven years, wanted to sell it. They had to get the signatures of 14 people along the road before the sale could go through. There have been disputes and rows over rights of way. They have been a recipe for rows that lasted years and years. I know of one case not too far from where I live where one of the people involved in the dispute over a right of way lost some of his faculties and was never the same man again after that serious row. Having to institute legal proceeding against neighbours or having to get them to sign documents is all wrong. I advise neighbours to go as far as they can towards agreement. People should ask their neighbours if they mind them registering rights of way over their land. They should go that far because letters from one neighbour to another were coming out from solicitors' offices and that was very hurtful and caused rancour and dispute in respect of rights of way. The deadline was also wrong in another way. People had to have been using these rights of way for 12 years. Some people may have been using them for ten or 11 years by this 30 November.As a result, they would not have been able to register them, which would have meant they would have had to have gone back to the start to regain their long use status. That aspect of the 2009 Act was wrong. There is an awful lot of work to be done to ensure we get this right. Disputes over rights of way and boundary ditches have been keeping the courts busy for a long time. We need to get it right. It needs to be advertised and some allowance needs to be given for submissions to be made, whether independently, by parties or whatever, to see how the new system will operate. Many people must be allowed to have an input to ensure we get it right this time. Issues such as the width of the right of way and so on need to be sorted out because otherwise there will be a need for more court cases, which are very costly for whoever loses. We should avoid that and have some simpler system in order that people will not have to resort to that. I thank the Government for acceding to my request to extend the deadline until next year when it will bring forward a new proposal.	spk_317

It is one of the most hurtful things that is happening in our county at present. We do not have an adequate service. I compliment the drivers, paramedics and all the staff who do an excellent job. It is the management of the ambulance service that is wrong without a shadow of a doubt. Ambulance workers are burnt out from long exhausting shifts. Ambulance staff work very hard to perform an invaluable service in caring for our communities. Far too often, patients are left waiting for far too long when they need urgent medical help. This not only causes considerable distress to patients but can worsen the medical outcomes. We must stand up for our ambulance service workers and ensure they get the support they need to do their jobs properly. We need to expand our ambulance fleet to ensure rural communities are properly served and not left behind as they are at the present time. We need to increase hospital capacity to avoid patients being left waiting in ambulances.  Up until 2012, we had a very good ambulance service before the reconfiguration of the National Ambulance Service. What it actually meant was a reduction of the ambulance service. Ambulances are being deployed from south Kerry deep into the heart of west Cork. Recently an ambulance crew started off at 8 o'clock in the morning and took a patient to Cork University Hospital. When they pressed the button coming out of there, they were sent to Dungarvan to take a patient to University Hospital Waterford. When they came out of Waterford, they were told to go back to Dungarvan for a second patient and took that patient back to Waterford again. Then they thought they were coming back to Kerry but they were told to go to Clonmel. That is the God's honest gospel truth. That happened. Our county of Kerry was left for a whole 12-hour shift without that ambulance, which is not good enough. We are on the back burner because more ambulances go to Cork and not so many Cork ambulances go to Kerry. Therefore, we are left without a service. A farmer had four fingers cut off. After a long wait, his wife had to wrap up his hand, bundle him into a car and take him herself. The last drive that Ambrose O'Sullivan got to the hospital, instead of being in an ambulance was in his wheelchair in the back of a Transit van. That is not good enough. We had a better service years ago than we have now. The Government needs to wake up and do something about it.	spk_271

It is affecting every man, woman and child. Everyone is suffering because of the high cost of energy and fuel prices. While costs have increased worldwide, more than half the cost of fuel and energy is going in taxes to the Government. Indeed, €60 in every €100 spent on fuel, diesel, petrol or home heating oil is paid in carbon taxes. The sheiks in Iran, Iraq or wherever are getting somewhere in the region of €15 of that, while transport and retail makes up the rest of it. The retail outlets, that is, the petrol stations, get around €3.50. We should remember that that is charged on top of all these carbon and other taxes. The Government is taking the people for a ride all right. Perhaps we will also run out of petrol. The Government gave away €225 million last week in the name of climate change. This money was collected from carbon taxes that hard-pressed Irish people were forced to pay and will be forced to pay. The Government appears to be hanging its coat on offshore energy, which may not happen for more than ten years. The Government closed down Bord na Móna and one third of Moneypoint, only to have to open it again. It put in nothing to replace the generating stations that it closed. It is opposing the Shannon LNG project. It is telling us to buy electric cars when there is nowhere to plug them in. It is very likely that there will be no electricity to charge such vehicles when people go to charge them.In the recent past we have had eight amber alerts. We have the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, saying we will bring in electricity and we will have a connection to France and the UK. We are all under the one sky. They have to generate electricity there also somehow. It costs more to bring it from far away. There is a carbon footprint in that. We have had 35 electricity price increases in recent months. The cost has increased by almost 20%. Imagine it has increased by almost one fifth. The price of gas has increased by 14%. Home heating oil has increased by 50% from 38 cent this time last year to 84 cent now. The Government is closing Bord na Móna, Shannonbridge and Lanesborough and 10,000 acres of bog are left in Littleton. We are importing peat from Latvia and briquettes from Germany. At the same time, a special case is being made for Romania because it relies so much on coal. It will be allowed to produce coal and sell it and do what it likes with it. We cannot cut a sod of turf. The Government does not want us to cut a sod of turf. Householders and people trying to heat their homes cannot cope with the savage energy costs. Farmers are being put through the mill. The increased cost of diesel means tractors, jeeps, cars and other work vehicles cost way more to run. These extra costs are eating into the profit margins of farmers. We rely on commercial transport for all of our goods, as has been said. When the cost of transport increases the cost of everything else increases and it has done so. We are calling on the Government to increase the diesel rebate in commercial industry from 7.5 cent to 15 cent. It should be doubled to give people a chance to keep going. It is one thing if we have to pay more for services, food and hardware but if we cannot get them it will be way more serious. People trying to heat their homes are in a desperate way. The Government left one serious crowd behind in the budget. These are people on social welfare benefit payments. They cannot get a fuel allowance. At the same time, they must pay exorbitant prices for their fuel and perhaps must leave their homes without heating. They end up cold and getting pneumonia and other problems people get when their homes are not heated.	spk_30

While I do not blame the Minister of State, I certainly understand why we cannot put any money into the so-called rainy day fund when the Taoiseach went to COP26 in Scotland and gave away €225 million this year, with a promise of more over the next ten years. How could we have any money to put into the rainy day fund? While I acknowledge the Covid pandemic has been a savage strain on the coffers of the Department of Finance, this is not the thing to do. We are not a country rolling in money such that we can give away €225 million when it is raining for many already. People cannot get proper healthcare or a proper service. It is pouring down on top of working people, including those in the transport business. The farming community did not get a bob in the budget and, on top of that, the cost of diesel is savage now. It is raining down on top of farmers every day because they cannot move without diesel and it is an extra cost. People are struggling on waiting lists, many of whom are homeless, suffering and wondering where they will finish up. Many people with families are being told to get out of the house they are renting. It is raining for people because of high rents, especially in towns like Killarney, Kenmare and Dingle. There are 676 applications on our local improvement schemes list, only 31 of which were completed over the past two years. At the rate we are going, it will be 80 years before that list is exhausted. I ask the Minister of State to look at that matter. Surely, we will not give away money next year when things like that have to be dealt with. Can the Minister of State imagine that people on benefit payments will not get any fuel allowance? People on illness benefit and even all those who paid stamps would not get those benefit payments otherwise. Someone on a benefit payment such as illness benefit who is living with a pensioner with cancer will not get the fuel allowance. Can the Minister of State imagine that? The Taoiseach then went and gave away €225 million last week. It is absolutely ridiculous giving it away like that when it is raining on a lot of other people in our country.	spk_234
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-11-09	dail	33	Regional Transport Infrastructure: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_17	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about this very important subject because we do not have public transport in many places in rural Kerry. A few years ago the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said that one car in a village would service six or eight different families. Is that the ideal that he is still going by or that the Government is still going by? I welcome the eight new routes that should be allocated to Kerry, including from places like Fenit to Farranfore Airport three times per day. However, much of the carbon tax that is being collected, after the €225 million that was given away the other day, is for new bus after new bus for Dublin city. Double decker buses and other long buses in Dublin have big signs on their left-hand corners warning people to look out for the tail swing. Buses are so big and plentiful that there is hardly room for anything else on the roads. If you watch outside the Dáil gate the buses are going by one after another and there are only two or three people at most inside any of them. Places like Gneeveguilla, Scartaglin and Cordal are far away. The Government is saying that 500,000 people will be walking by 2030 but can you imagine walking from places like that to work or cycling from Gneeveguilla or Scartaglin, Lauragh, The Black Valley or Bonane? That is not on. I know it might not be by choice and that the Government is tied on to the Green Party but that is the decision that was made and that is the worry I have. On school transport, no child should be left behind if he or she is more than 1 km from a school. I mention our road network and the local improvement scheme, LIS. We still have 676 schemes on the list. The people in Kerry are entitled to a good road to their doors the same as the people in Dublin 4. These are public roads; not private ones. They are public roads that were never taken in charge. We need a bypass for Killarney because it has over 18,000 vehicle movements every day. That is too much, the people of Killarney are being choked up and it could affect our tourism product.	spk_257

Their Bill is important and has to be given recognition and attention. The current set-up is outdated. The Bill would allow credit unions to provide a greater range of financial services to their members. Credit unions are vital for people who live on the margins and on a shoestring, where every penny counts. When something happens along the lines of people having to go to the North to get cataracts, hips or knees dealt with, we are glad of the help credit unions give them. Otherwise, they could lose their sight or continue being in pain for years while waiting to have a hip or knee done. Under the regulations, credit unions have to set aside €100 out of every €1,000 to maintain their capital reserves. On average, their reserves are actually at 17%. That is unfair. Credit unions cannot accept new accounts of more than €10,000. Given that the value of money has depreciated, this needs to be rectified. Banks are pulling out of local communities, for example, Ulster Bank. We need there to be competition. The Government has to do something to bring credit unions up to date. The Central Bank is wielding too much power and is too close to the mainstream banks. We need the credit unions to survive and grow.	spk_40

It is not acceptable that the fishermen of Ireland can only fish 15% of Irish waters. The Government must do something about that. Ministers must take off their coats and should not take ""no"" for an answer. This does not only affect trawlermen and fishermen as it affects all coastal communities from Malin Head to Mizen Head. The Government must do something about it. The Taoiseach indicated there were discussions on increasing energy and gas prices. What will we do about that? As Deputy O'Donoghue said, hauliers can only go so far. Anybody with a wheel is seeing costs increasing every day, so they cannot continue. The country will grind to a halt because hauliers cannot continue in the vein they are in if they do not get assistance through a proper rebate. What is happening with energy provision and electricity? On the one hand we hear Deputy O'Dowd saying we should take on conglomerates, but at the same time his party is going after people selling coal, perhaps to the people who cannot pay for anything else. He was like the Director of Public Prosecutions saying these people should be prosecuted. Does he want people to be perished in their homes as if they lived in igloos in Iceland? God almighty, the Government must do something about this. The fertiliser situation is very serious. I asked the Taoiseach what he will do about it to ensure the agricultural community and farmers can continue. If we do not have fertilisers at a reasonable cost, the farmers will grind to a halt as well."	spk_300

I appeal to the Minister of State to fight for the continuation of the export of dairy-bred bull calves because we are an island nation and it takes a good deal of time to get out of the country by boat or whatever.

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-11-03	dail	33	Finance Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_19	There is no doubt about it; this is a deeply anti-rural budget that will do nothing to support the rural economy of the family farm. Costs for those operating family farms or living in the countryside will be substantially increased. With blatantly voiced discrimination, the budget of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens, whacks consumers, motorists and homeowners through regressive carbon tax hikes, while rewarding banks with massive tax cuts. I appreciate very much the extension of the help-to-buy scheme. The continuation of the scheme is most welcome. However, there are several other issues that I am very concerned about, for example, the cutting of the roads budget by €88 million. I will talk about County Kerry and local improvement schemes. There are 676 schemes still on the list. We got through 20 this year and 11 last year. That is a total of 31 delivered over two years. There will be no account of any one of us if we keep going that way with 20 schemes being delivered a year. I remember, in times gone by, when 111 schemes were delivered in one year after the other for two years. We are being let down. I have said it several times before that the people of Kerry and those living on those roads are entitled to a good road to their doors, just the same as the people in Dublin 4.  The carbon tax is wrong. Going back, the Government promised us that there would be a scheme for solar panels and for farm solar panels to boost energy and create electricity. I know of a farmer, who was on television this evening, who has created enough power using the solar panels on his shed alone to cover his own electricity. He could supply much more of it to the grid, but there is no facility for him to do so. That facility for solar panels was supposed to be put in place by 2020. Now we are being told that it will not be introduced until 2030. What the Government is doing is penalising the farmer. The farmer is driven mad at the same time. The Government is hurting everyone else as well, including hauliers. Members of the Government should remember that there is a carbon footprint for bringing electricity along long distances. That is what happening now. However, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications would rather try to reduce the national herd, paralyse the haulage industry, and target farmers, people going to work and the transport and taxi industries.  The way we are going, older people and many others may be perishing in their homes before the winter is over because they will not be able to pay for the electricity, fuel, oil or paraffin that they use. There have been amber lights flashing all year long telling us that we may run out of electricity. We know about the cost of it, which is bad enough. What is the Government doing about it? The Taoiseach and his gang were all over in Glasgow at COP26 this week. The Taoiseach promised that he would give €200 million this year, and every year for ten years, to address the causes of climate change. Did he tell the Minister he was doing that? Are the Taoiseach and the Minister working together or what is happening? It is very serious. The Government is collecting carbon tax with one hand, and giving away with the other to these fellas to keep these so-called scientists and whomever, flying from country to country. We do not know what they are dropping on us from the aeroplanes when they are doing that. The Government is still doing all of this in the name of climate change. The members of Government would very much want to cop on. Are we dealing with the biggest crowd of lunatics ever to run the country? When we see, on the one hand, the collection of the carbon tax and the torture they are putting people through, it is the best country in the world if it will keep going. We see the state of our hospitals, our farmers and our workers trying to go to work. No felling licences have been granted to applicants for more than three years. I know of one fella and it was seven years before he got his licence the other day. Hauliers and the transport industry are being affected. The Government tells us that it has closed down Bord na Móna. We know that. It closed one third of Moneypoint and put nothing in to replace it. It is no wonder the amber lights are flashing. The Government is opposing Shannon LNG and is telling fellas to buy electric cars. Where are they going to plug them in? Where are they going to get the electricity? Will the electricity be there when they plug them in? It is very likely that there will not be electricity to charge them. I ask the Minister to cop on and to deal with the basics. To give and flit away €200 million of the people's money this week, which was collected in the name of carbon tax and other taxes, is very wrong. The Government is putting pressure on the people of Ireland, and especially farmers, hauliers and the transport industry. It is very wrong to do that to those people. I cannot say that I condone it, and I never will. I will never condone something like that, namely putting ordinary, good, hard-working people through what the Government is putting them through in the name of climate change.

We had Sport Ireland come out late last week saying children and youngsters attending all basketball playing would have to produce vaccine passports. This is very wrong in places like Rathmore, Gneevgullia, Killarney, Firies and all the various places where all the youngsters and all the clubs had paid their membership, and it was only after that that Sport Ireland came out and said what it said. In reality, volunteers are being asked to demand that youngsters attending events produce vaccine passports. We have to remember that under-12s have not been vaccinated at all yet. It is very unfair. The whole basketball season has been thrown into mayhem, and I ask the Minister and the Government to deal with this in an honourable way. It is not fair to ask volunteers to demand vaccine passports of youngsters before they are allowed in to play basketball.Why did they not do that in the first place before the clubs registered? Why did they not ask for that and spell out what was going to be demanded rather than doing it when the money had been collected by Sport Ireland?

Three weeks ago, eight senior consultants at University Hospital Kerry wrote to general practitioners and elected members stating: ""Our hospital is in crisis since the second week of September."" The letter went on to state that elective surgery has been cancelled, there are high numbers of patients on trolleys in the emergency department, there are staff shortages and staff burn-out, that no surgical day ward is operating and that the acute medical assessment unit is closed more often than it is open. There are 2,300 people on waiting lists for elective surgery, many of them in pain. Elective surgery has been cancelled. Elderly people up to 90 years of age are on trolleys in corridors for two or three days as they wait for a bed. That is not right. A respectable senior citizen who operated a highly respectable business in Killarney for many years died on a trolley in Tralee hospital. UHK needs 100 additional nurses. We need an independent assessment and external review to identify what has gone wrong in order that we can rectify the situation. I am told that senior decision-makers and on-call management rotas are practically non-existent at weekends, that elderly people are being sent home in ambulances without a homecare plan in place, with many of those who can walk being sent home in taxis, that ambulances are queuing for three to four hours waiting to unload at the accident and emergency department and that ambulances assigned to Kerry, which operate on a 12-hour shift basis, are being redeployed at the start of a shift to areas in Cork and as far away as Dungarvan and that they often complete that shift in Clonmel, leaving Kerry unserviced during that entire shift. Reconfiguration of the ambulance service in 2012 has resulted in a reduction of service in Kerry. Staff are exhausted, mentally and physically. Last month, there were 422 patients on trolleys while four years ago, there were only 114 people on trolleys. The week before last there were 84 people on trolleys.

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-10-19	dail	33	Rental Sector: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	I thank Sinn Féin for giving us the opportunity again this evening to talk about rents. I declare that people may say I have a conflict of interest because Deputy Michael Healy-Rae is in that business and I am his brother. I concur with what Members have said. The cost of rents has become very steep and people cannot meet the amounts being charged. They are in a desperate way, especially in Killarney, Dingle, Kenmare and other places around the county. We need to build more social housing. We have had enough schemes and reports. Give us the money in Kerry to build more social housing. That is the answer to it. We have the land and the builders to build them. Give us more money and forget about HAP and such schemes. I look forward to the Government getting rid of those schemes and building social houses for people. We must help people trying to build their own houses and who are having severe difficulty getting planning. A lovely young girl got planning permission and some lousy being objected and appealed to An Bord Pleanála. Even though everything was perfect, An Bord Pleanála dismissed her planning application and she finished up not getting it. An Bord Pleanála refuse 90% of all rural planning applications that come before it. That is some record. It must be tackled because it is not fair.  I saw a case the other day where someone else objected and the poor young couple have to wait until December and January before they can reopen the holes, so making sure they will not get planning after a year and a half. To think that has happened in our county and a young couple trying to put a roof over their heads are being denied planning in this way. We must seek to do something about the levies being charged and the regulations being put on them because the cost of materials has gone out of control. The Government must try to do something about that and recognise it. Do not try to blot it out or whatever because it is happening. A 6 ft by 3 ft stick of timber that was €20 for years is now €38. Will the Minister think of that?	spk_271
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-10-13	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 2: General (Resumed)	dbsect_19	I am glad to have the opportunity to talk on the budget again this evening. It is an anti-rural budget. It is hurting a great many people, especially people in rural Ireland. Anyone with a wheel of any kind is affected. People travelling long distances to work, parents taking children to schools, lorry men transporting items to shops and so on will all face increased costs. Taxi men are hurt. Farmers with jeeps and tractors are going to be hurt. There is no recognition at all of the carbon they sequester. Agricultural contractors are being hurt. Elderly sick people who are trying to heat their homes are being hurt. Many people on benefit payments have been let down. I raised this with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, the other day. I spoke about people on illness benefit, jobseeker's benefit, enhanced illness benefit, occupational injury benefit and disablement benefit. A pensioner living with a cancer patient who is in receipt of illness benefit does not qualify for the fuel allowance. How can that be fair or right? These people paid their contributions through the PAYE system. They would not be getting the benefit payments if they had not. These people are being left behind and that is totally wrong. In County Kerry, there were 697 applications to the local improvement scheme. Last year, we got money for 11. This year, we got money for 22. That is not enough. That is not fair. The people in Kerry are entitled to a good road to their door, the very same as the people in Dublin 4. They are paying their taxes, these massive fuel costs and carbon tax. They are paying taxes of every kind. They deserve fair play and they are not getting it.  With regard to the hospitality sector, the VAT rate is to rise from 9% to 13.5%. That will affect all of Kerry. While I welcome the €32 million for school transport, it is only an effort to keep up with the increasing costs. Fishermen and coastal communities have been left behind. Look at what has happened to them. No one fought for their quotas and they are being left behind. That has an effect on coastal communities in their entirety. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, for the allowances he made but I ask him not to forget Kenmare. He was good enough to come down to Kenmare and Killorglin when we asked him to. There are a few other schemes as well which he did not mention tonight. I ask him not to forget them because the people of Kenmare have suffered for long enough.	spk_180
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-10-12	dail	33	Budget Statement 2022	dbsect_4	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the budget this evening. It will be remembered as a frightening budget because of the increase in the carbon tax. Many people would have thought that the carbon tax, which was put in place last year and is to last for another seven or eight years, would be paused this year in light of the increased cost of fuel coming into this country caused by worldwide prices. However, the Government is adding to the cost by ensuring that people pay this carbon tax. They will be paying it from midnight tonight or shortly afterwards. This is going to affect every man, woman and child in the country, especially people who are working. It will affect people who get up early in the morning to drive long distances to work, mothers taking children to school and farmers. A chairman of one farming organisation said to me tonight:All we can do, Danny, is keep putting the diesel in and keep paying the cost until we find we have no more money to pay. The way it is, we will go as far as we can but it is hard to see that we will be able to continue in any fair way for months longer into the future.Then there are the transport costs for commercial vehicles. Can one imagine adding to their woes by imposing a carbon tax on them again today? Let us consider the passenger buses and the cost that is being added for them. It is a diminution of their income. The same applies to taxis. Any man or woman who has a wheel turning at all will be affected in a desperate way. It is clear that the Government is staying in power with the support of the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth's, party. It is pandering to the party every day and everywhere. It is terrible that this is being meted out to people. The people in rural Ireland are affected most. What are the alternatives? The Government talks about wind energy from turbines out at sea. We are ten years away from that. In the meantime, people must live and try to stay warm in their homes. We are importing briquettes and peat moss for the horticulture industry. We have no alternatives. However, the Taoiseach said the other day that two gas burning electricity generators are broken down at present and it is hoped to get them working. Imagine we have reduced ourselves to that - close Shannonbridge and Lanesborough, forget about the 10,000 acres of bog in Littleton and let the people perish in their homes for the winter or, perhaps, have no light. With regard to retrofitting and insulation, there is a wait of two and a half years. All we will see is new big shiny buses in Dublin and the people in rural areas suffering. The price of diesel and petrol has gone to €1.65 per litre and it is almost €1 for green diesel. Then there is health. I do not accept that what has been suggested for health here today will resolve the problems we have been highlighting in UHK in Tralee.People aged 90 years and more are waiting for three days in corridors on trolleys. The ambulance service we are getting at present is not acceptable. The ambulance service was reconfigured in 2012 or 2013, but now there is often no ambulance to be found in Tralee, Killarney, Kenmare or Cahersiveen because they may have been sent to Cork, Kinsale or somewhere else around the country. People may be left on the side of the road following an accident. I am aware of a farmer whose fingers were cut off and another farmer who had been attacked by a bull and no ambulance was to be found. Nurses are worn out from working so hard with fewer numbers. Nurses are leaving in their droves for Australia. We need more doctors and consultants in our hospitals along with the teams that go with them. It is no good appointing a consultant without the team to accompany him. I welcome the extra assistance to be given to childcare workers and the college students being allowed to travel on buses and trains for half fares. However, the big problem for students in Killarney and the Kerry area is that they need to drive to Cork and other colleges because they cannot get accommodation. There is another thing and it is a simple thing. Students should be allowed to work and earn more than €4,500. I welcome the reduction of the qualifying distance from 45 km to 30 km. On housing, I ask the Minister to go back to the old model of buying sites and giving the funding to the local authorities to build social houses, as was done in the past and which was successful. We should go back to rural cottages on an applicant's own land. We should give funding to local authorities for demountable homes and raise the cap for families to qualify for council houses. For a couple with two children, the cap is €33,600. How could they afford to buy a house of their own? Planning for one-off houses is restricted. An Bord Pleanála refuses 95% of the applications that are granted in rural parts of Kerry. When some nosy good-for-nothing objector appeals the decision of Kerry County Council, An Bord Pleanála does not recognise our county development plan. When Kerry County Council grants application, An Bord Pleanála refuses it. Then we have another boyo, the planning regulator. He is dictating that less land should be zoned. How can we build houses if we do not zone land? The Government let the fishermen down in the Brexit talks and let down the farmers. Macra na Feirme, the IFA and all the farming organisations feel they have been let down in this budget, through the reduction in the herd, the felling licences and in many other ways. A man driving his own machine is now paying €250 more since the middle of the summer because of the extra cost. The Government is adding to that man's woes by increasing the carbon tax.	spk_66
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-10-12	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 1: Tobacco Products Tax	dbsect_7	I too am opposed to this tax increase. I feel it will place undue hardship on people, especially those with mental health problems. They will tell you smoking is the only consolation they have. If you weigh it up, the extra money they will get in their social welfare payments would not even cover the cost of the extra 50 cent if they were to smoke a packet of cigarettes a day and maybe a couple more in the run of the week. The extra fiver will not go far in that regard. It will never stop those people from having or wanting to smoke. Many of them developed an addiction for cigarettes long before it became clear that it was harmful. We should try to do something in our schools by way of increased education about the harmfulness of smoking. As for the many people living alone who have this craving for cigarettes, it is unfair to suggest that this increase in the cost of a box of cigarettes would help them or make them think they should stop smoking. That is a fairly ridiculous suggestion. It is much the same as the carbon tax. People have to use fuel to get to work and for all the other things, and elderly people have to use fuel to keep themselves warm. Again, this is nonsensical and more thought should have been put into it. It will hurt people who have mental illness or maybe depression when that is all they can reach for or want to reach for when they are in a certain situation. Cigarettes are certainly expensive as it is, and adding 50 cent to the price of them will not stop people who love smoking. It is fairly ridiculous and I will not vote for this measure.	spk_95

It is important to note that a person who shares a home with, or lives with, a person claiming illness benefit does not qualify for fuel benefit either, no matter how low his or her own income is. People do not qualify for fuel allowance if they live with someone who is getting one of the payments that qualify for fuel allowance. For example, a pensioner living with a cancer patient who is on illness benefit does not qualify for fuel allowance even though the State pension and illness benefit combined are considerably lower than the threshold of the fuel allowance means test.	spk_21

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-10-06	dail	33	Energy Prices: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this very serious problem. Indeed, it is a problem for the people of Kerry because, as we all know, their journeys to work are longer. Much of Kerry is comprised of farming communities. The cost of diesel for tractors has more than doubled and the cost of heating oil has more than doubled. I am concerned that elderly people could be cold in their homes this winter. We will have to return to turf cutting. Before this winter is out, people will be glad of a load of turf. Electricity costs have risen by 19%. Everyone is being advised to move to electric, including electric vehicles, yet there is no place to charge them. It appears now we will not have sufficient electricity to bring to the plugs. Transport costs affect every sector in the country, be that in regard to the transport of timber, slates and so on. We are told new-build houses will not have chimneys and that they should all have electric heat pumps. When there is no electricity, how will people heat their homes? Insulation costs have risen by 40%. The Government has a plan to retrofit houses but there is a wait of between a year and a half and two years in that regard. Why is that?  I want to also raise the serious issue of eligibility for the fuel allowance for many other categories of people in receipt of social welfare benefits. It is stipulated that to be eligible for the fuel allowance a person must be unemployed for 15 months. God almighty, that rule is not fit for purpose. Those people will get cold just like everyone else. The construction of houses without chimneys is a recipe for disaster. This is already happening in Kerry. What will keep people warm when the electricity runs out? The Government regularly speaks about offshore energy. It knows well that there will be no wind turbines out in the ocean for at least ten years. It needs to stop talking about that and to stop being ridiculous about things.	spk_38

In 1956, my late father started operating a school bus service to Kilgarvan National School. Since he gave it up, I have been doing it. It has given me great pride to see them starting out so small getting onto the bus or, as it was then, the school car and the way many of them have finished up - accountants, solicitors, teachers, you name it. You would be proud to have assisted them in any way back along the line. What we are talking about is to do more for children. I suppose the main thing is to keep them occupied. You find that may be easier on a farm or whatever, where they all have jobs to do. It is very important that youngsters are allowed work. There is an obstacle that bars restaurants and hotels from employing 14-year-olds, 15-year-olds and 16-year-olds. We do not want to kill them with work or anything, but they would be all the better for it. They would be learning something - how to do the different jobs or whatever. Sport is very important. I see young fellows who I brought to school a few years ago playing hurling at the weekends. They are fine men and doing a great job. You would be proud of them. There are issues in respect of affordable accommodation for students going to college. A group of girls and boys from Killarney came up here outside the Dáil on Thursday of last week. They have to drive from Kerry up to Cork because they cannot get accommodation. That is a desperate strain on them to drive up in the morning before college and drive back down after it, and try to study, get ready and get out on the road the next day. That is very hard on them. The other issue is that they are deprived of the opportunity to work during their holidays because they are not allowed to earn more than €4,500. It is very wrong to stop youngsters from working. If they earn a bit more than that, there should be no regulation stopping them from doing so. Whatever they earn at that age should not be counted when they are applying for the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant. It is important to get fellows to work when they are young because if they go on after college and they have not worked a little bit, they certainly will not start then. It is very important that obstacle be removed and taken out of the SUSI grant equation. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, to look at the matter.	spk_224

However, it looked like that was going to be the one and only extension but here is the Minister again, barefaced and looking for another extension. I can tell him that I am not voting for it because there is no exceptional need now and no emergency at the present time. I will tell the Minister where there is an emergency, however. There is an emergency in Kerry, with more than 2,200 people waiting for elective surgery. Many more will not be accepted onto the waiting lists because consultants have written to GPs to tell them not to refer any more patients. I am appealing to the Deputy from Kerry who has a very powerful position in this Government. He is the Chief Whip and I ask him to talk to the Minister for Health about the problems in Kerry rather than going on local radio in Kerry to tell the people what they already know. People are suffering, they are in pain and agony. They need to be seen by consultants and to be operated on. Deputy Griffin should not be telling the people what they already know.

Many childcare workers have contacted me in recent weeks pleading that we ask the Government to do something about their pay and conditions because they are not being properly looked after. That is the truth of it. Providers are under pressure as well, as are parents. Parents are being asked to pay more than they can afford for childcare to allow them go out to do a bit of work and make a bit of money to keep the roof over their heads. There can be no functioning economy without a functioning care economy. We must invest in the care economy, both in those caring for the ill and elderly and those caring for our nation's children. We must raise the pay and improve the working conditions of care workers, including the many women on which the sector depends. As we count down to the budget next week, much depends on what the Government does for these workers. As we all know, many parents have to work to pay the bills, keep a roof over their heads and pay their mortgages. Ireland has one of the most poorly funded childcare systems in Europe. The system locks women out of the labour market and wider participation in society and traps the childcare workforce in low-paid employment. I mention briefly elderly parents who are trying to look after children who have physical and intellectual disabilities. Those people need to get recognition in the budget.	spk_224

People will not be able to pay for electricity or energy to keep themselves warm this winter. The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will be aware that two weeks ago his party colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, said there was no problem with energy supply. He came out yesterday to say that we will be in trouble for the next four or five years and that we may have outages. This does not inspire confidence in him, the leader of the Green Party, or in the Government. Everything is supposed to be electric, such as electric cars, but we have no charging points and we do not even have enough electricity. The Government reinstated Moneypoint workers to whom they had given redundancy. The Government has been caught with its trousers down because it did not realise we would run out of electricity when it closed Bord na Móna and closed Moneypoint.I am asking the Government to bring back the workers to Bord na Móna to ensure the people of this country do not have to suffer power outages.

I appreciate anyone who is doing their best. However, too much emphasis is on what the private sector will provide in this plan. Local authorities should be given funding to build more social houses. We should build more rural cottages where applicants provide the sites. We should give local authorities like Kerry money for homes to be sited in farms or other places so people do not leave the places they were born and reared in. A proper tenant purchase scheme, as touched on by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, needs to be put in place. There is a stipulation that a house built since 2015 cannot be purchased. This is out the window when we hear the Taoiseach saying he supports the ideal that everyone should own their own home. That is not happening, even with local authorities. The cap for a couple with three children is €33,600. People a small bit over the threshold are thrown off of that. On planning permission for one-off houses, we are having trouble in Kerry at present and I ask that it be looked into. We need treatment plants for towns and villages that have been crying out for them for so long. In Kenmare, you cannot get permission for a development but you can for a one-off house. All development is stymied by the state of our treatment plants in our towns and villages. Scartaglin and Curra have no treatment plan at all. Scartaglin was number one at one stage when Tom Fleming and I were councillors. Where is it now? It is on no list at all. There has been much talk of the cost of rents. The Government must consider doing something to reduce the percentage it takes from landlords paying 51% or 52% tax. That has to be addressed.	spk_392
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-09-22	dail	33	Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I thank the Labour Party. While I do not agree with parts of what it is proposing, I appreciate anyone trying to do anything about housing. I thank the Minister for all the work he has done but I must tell him that there is more to be done to get this off the ground. Regarding what is being proposed, it would not be fair to stop landlords from selling their houses. Surely if they own a house, they have the right to sell it or give it to a family member if that person comes of a certain age and wants a house to live in once tenants are given proper notice. However, I also see the side that is very hurtful. It is hard when tenants are told to quit, possibly after a number of years in the property, and they are not even on the housing list. They did not think of doing that. It takes ten or 12 years to get a council house if someone is on the housing list in Killarney and rents are very high. The Government must do something in this area as well because most landlords are paying tax at 51%. When rents are going up and the Government's take is more, why does it not see fit to reduce the tax rate and spread it between the tenant and the landlord? This would be better business. The Government is saying nothing. It is taking 51% in tax while the cost of rent is outrageous.  I have spoken about the tenant purchase scheme for a long time. Between 2011 and 2017, a complete stop was put to people buying council houses. A number of people who have reached pension age are not allowed to purchase their house after possibly renting for 37 or 40 years. I know a family that is very hurt by this. There are many others. Regarding council houses built since 2015, I hear the Government.Yesterday, the Tánaiste said the Government supported the idea of everyone, or as many people as possible, owning their own homes. However, local authorities are not allowed to sell a house built after 2015 to tenants. Any house built by a local authority after 2015 cannot be purchased by a tenant. When we size up and examine closely the new Bill introduced by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, it looks like a lot will depend on the private sector building houses, whether developers or small builders. It is impossible for many of them to build like they used to because of the VAT rates, taxes and levies that have to be paid and the rules and regulations. Small builders are being affected whereby they can no longer get stage payments. They must carry the whole cost of building a house until it is completely finished and the key is being turned in the door. This is very hard on some builders. It is putting small builders out of business. Why not give money to the local authorities to build rural cottages where applicants have their own sites? Kerry County Council tells me that where a house has fallen into disrepair, there is a system of taking out a demountable home. This was cited by the late Gerry Collins and his team. A demountable home can be put in place within a few days and means people no longer have to be in a house with no roof, which is leaking, where things have got very bad or where there is vermin. The local authority now says it has no money for this system. Will the Minister speak to Kerry County Council about this? It is a very serious issue. Demountable homes cannot be provided to people in such a situation and who will not leave the land or place they were born. At present, the local authority may allocate them a house in the local village but they will not leave the place they were born and reared. Will the Minister look at this?	spk_74
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-09-22	dail	33	Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_13	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about this very important matter. It affects issues from west Cork to Kerry, Dingle to Cahersiveen, and all the way up the west of Ireland to Donegal. Deputies Collins, Ferris and I met with the former Minister, Deputy Creed, when he was introducing the statutory instrument. He did not listen to us. Gladly, Pat the Cope Gallagher, the Minister's former fellow Deputy from County Donegal, annulled the statutory instrument but when the Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, got into power he introduced the statutory instrument again. The way that these penalty points are being meted out is not fair. If a person contests them in the courts and proves the case he or she will not get those points removed from their licence. This legislation makes no sense because the UK vessels will not get points in Irish waters. There is no fairness in the courts system. The Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation argues that the penalty points system could remove an individual's income without that person having recourse to the courts. This is a farcical situation. The courts may say that a person is innocent but the points still remain. The Minister is from County Donegal. Is he going to stand over what is happening here and hurting fishermen from Killybegs, all along the west coast down to Dingle and Cahersiveen and along the west coast of Cork? After all, the Minister is from a county that is very much like ours. The weighing of fisheries products is not covered by this Bill, even though the Government knows that this has been a serious issue since new rules were introduced on 13 April last with immediate effect. In short, the difficulties arise around whether weighing can take place before or after transport, that is, at piers rather than in factories, and in the context of removing ice packaging and having to put it all back in place again. This is totally unfair. Individual weighing and repacking as part of the weighing control system and the problem resulting from this process will not result in better fish quality. Why apply penalty points to Irish fishermen while UK fishermen fishing in Irish territorial waters are not to be tackled at all? What are the Minister and the Government doing? Can they not stand up for fair play? Rather than penalising our fishermen, why do the Minister and Government not fight for more quotas for them and give them a chance to live? It is affecting the rural communities as well as the fishermen.	spk_174

We all know what the banks did, including Anglo Irish Bank. I know fellows who cried, grown men, and the fellows in charge of it got away. We all know what Bank of Ireland and AIB did going back to when they advised their customers to put their money into overseas accounts. I know one man who never did a day's good after that. It should have been easy enough for someone to follow the pattern. It was not that men from the wilds of Blackwater, Sneem or, indeed, Kilgarvan, all had the idea to do the same thing; they got the advice to do that and they all suffered. They paid high penalties and their names were in the newspaper and the bank got away with it because they gave the names. Anglo Irish Bank got away with it. Bank of Ireland was no angel either. It is closing its outlets in different towns in Kerry and we do not applaud that. The Government has a percentage stake in both banks. It should use it to ensure that a service is given to the people and especially the people in rural Ireland. Farms are being sold by vulture funds without farmers knowing. I contend that the vulture funds are all wrong. The customer had a deal with the bank, not the vulture funds, or they were never made aware that these vulture funds would come along with henchmen and sticks, who wore masks to hide who they were, threatening them to get out of their houses and off their land. These vulture funds have no right, even though they purchased something from a bank or finance company at a cheap price. There should be a follow-up there to see what is going on. These funds do not operate according to the deal done between the person who might have bought their house and ran into health problems or maybe the person who was trying to improve his lot as a farmer, buying a piece of land to try to increase his income to try to stay on the land. They did a deal with a financial company in Ireland, usually, Bank of Ireland, AIB or whoever, and the accounts were sold to the vulture funds. They should be followed up. 	spk_143

They did not help the people on the ground who lost their money, maybe sums of €20,000, €60,000, €70,000, €80,000 or €90,000. Instead, it went on the side of the developer or businessman who went broke and helped them more than the ordinary people who lost all the money they were owed.

I am very concerned about the housing situation and have become even more so as the days have gone on since the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, put his Bill, which I voted for, through the Dáil. I have serious concerns about this new programme because I think there is only one way to build houses or to get houses built. That is to give the money to the local authorities, buy the sites and build the houses, full stop. I do not think this thing of 20% or 10% will ever materialise. If a developer sells one side of his site for housing at €600,000, how will he get people to buy those houses if the local authorities can buy them for €250,000 or whatever? I cannot see that working. Rents have been and still are going up. I am not taking the side of the landlords but it is affecting the renters. However, everyone including the Minister must recognise, I have said it in here several times previously, the State is getting 51% out of the rent. If the rent is €800 or €1,000, the landlord gets only half of that. With all this talk, with all the money the Government has for housing and all it wants to do about housing, surely the Government could reduce tax on the rent and that would help. It could then ensure that the landlords reduced the rent similarly to the people who are renting. Carbon tax and all the other taxes are putting people and parents under all kinds of punishment and under pressure. They are feeling every penny that they have to pay out. There is now a serious problem with planning permission in our county. Things have happened in recent days and planning permission has been refused. It looks to be the intention of the site suitability assessments to refuse every planning permission that will come in to the local authority. People have been on the waiting lists for ten to 12 years in Killarney. Rents are expensive there, as they are in Kenmare and Dingle.  As for the Bill brought in by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I am grateful to him because I appreciate any man who tries anything. That is why I voted for the Bill. However, so much of what is in the Bill depends on private house builders and on bigger developers to build these houses. If the Government is serious about it, it must put money into it themselves. Before any block is put into the ground, VAT and levies are denying small builders, and even big builders, the opportunity to build houses.	spk_171
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-09-16	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_32	I wish to raise with the Tánaiste a very urgent, serious problem that has erupted for the people of Bunane, Kenmare and on the west Cork side, Glengarriff and Bantry. A serious problem has arisen whereby Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, proposes to close the N71 Caha Pass tunnel between Cork and Kerry for ten weeks from 4 November. Everyone appreciates the work it proposes to carry out to stabilise part of the roof of the tunnel. That work needs to be done but the timing is wrong. We all know that the country was closed down for a very long time and we are disappointed that the work was not carried out then. I attended a meeting organised by the Bunane Community Council at Stephen O'Sullivan's premises, Molly Gallivan's, as did many other public representatives. The meeting was also attended by a massive crowd of business people, farmers and concerned individuals from the Kenmare, Bunane, Glengarriff and Bantry areas of west Cork as well. It was pointed out clearly that business, tourism, agriculture and every other aspect of life have been closed down for almost a year and a half and that they hope to be busy for all the month of October and the early part of November. Molly Gallivan's already has 22 buses booked for October. It was also pointed out that 30 or more cruise liners came into Bantry Harbour last October and it is expected that they will return next month. The spin-off from them would help Bunane, Glengarriff and the Kenmare area if they could go back and forth through the tunnel. This is the only option for buses, as the only other way to connect Bantry and Kenmare is eastwards to Macroom in mid-Cork, which is more than 35 miles one way. The manager of Kenmare mart told the meeting, as did many farmers from the Bantry, Skibbereen and Goleen areas, that the main trading time for selling sheep and weanlings is October and early November. My ask on behalf of the local community is that the time for beginning the works should be pushed out towards the end of November and that the timeframe for the works to be completed would be reduced from ten weeks, as this is way too long. There are a few pinch points in the roof of the tunnel already, preventing coaches of the maximum height from getting through the tunnel.	spk_178

Deputy Griffin is interrupting me and hurting the people of south Kerry and west Cork while I am speaking to the Tánaiste for the few minutes that I have. That is fine, but if he had told the Tánaiste the story, he would not need to be talking to him now. What I am asking now of the Tánaiste and Minister for Transport is to not start the works until the end of November and most certainly to raise the roof of the tunnel to make it passable for every type of vehicle going from one county to the other.

I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath and his office girls for helping us with this motion. More than anyone else, I look forward to every door being opened in the hospitality sector. Whether the businesses are pubs or small restaurants, they have been closed for far too long. The longer they remain closed, the greater the risk that many of them will never open again. That is a fact. Attitudes are changing and, possibly, people are resigned to buying alcohol and having a few drinks at home because there is no problem with meeting the Garda on the road or whatever if they do so. People are doing things differently now. I worry that things will never again be the same for many businesses. I have made calls in the House, day after day, that pubs and small restaurants be allowed to open in the very same way as hotels and businesses in other sectors. Nearly every other sector is open. When we look across the Border, businesses are all open up there. I know of stags, hens and all kinds of parties, travelling up to the North. There is no problem about it and people are drinking inside. This is happening to such an extent that when we looked for beds for people we were taking up on the next bus, there was not a bed to be had. In the whole of the North of Ireland, all the beds are full because they are booked up by people from the South. That is the truth of it. Over the past five years, we had no problem getting beds for people going to the North to get their eyes, hips or whatever done, but now we have a serious problem. The Government is bringing in its legislation in a final attempt to put restrictions in place, because it knows pubs will have to open. What is being done is very unfair and it is dividing the people. Where is data protection? If we ring up about someone's medical card or something, there is such a rigmarole about data protection. Now, however, there is not a bother in the world. One person is supposed to ask a customer coming in, ""Have you been vaccinated? Show me your vaccination pass"". This is totally and absolutely ridiculous. So many people have rung me, emailed me and written to me asking me not to support this legislation the Government is bringing in because it is creating a divide. I know of women with blood clotting problems. Last night, another lady said, ""Surely Danny, you won't vote for something to keep me outside the door."" She has a problem because she takes blood thinners and her doctor has advised her not to get vaccinated. Is she to be kept outside while her husband, son and daughter go into the local pub? Is that what the Government will do to her? I cannot do that. Several other people who got the first vaccine had a reaction to it. They finished up in Cork University Hospital where they had to stay for several nights. They are not taking the second vaccine and will not be able to get this pass. I know of one man, who is more entitled than anyone else to have a couple of pints because he works very hard, for whom it will mean being left outside. Who will police this? It is not policeable. There are many other things the Garda need to do. Gardaí are up to their necks already, so what more resources are being given to the Garda Síochána to do this? The Government had no plan. It opened nearly everywhere else on 1 June but it did not come up with a plan until the week before 5 July when it stated that the reopening was going to be delayed again.When so much displeasure was expressed about it, the Government said it wanted a plan from the vintners. It met the vintners, in other words, after the fair. Some of the vintners' organisations say they will go with the proposal but they have not contacted their rank and file. Young people are being forced to look for the vaccine. Chemists and pharmacists are inundated with young people, aged between 18 and 30, looking for the vaccine so they are legally allowed inside a public house or restaurant. This plan is totally unfair. It is creating a divide and I cannot vote for it in its present form. What the Government is trying to do to the people, especially in rural Ireland, is totally unfair."	spk_14

I am disappointed with the legislation, which is being rushed through. No less than anyone else, I wanted the hospitality sector to reopen fully and for people to be spread out. Clearly, this Bill is discrimination of the highest order. There was no consultation. Maybe some few words were had with the heads of the vintners' organisation and so on, but there was no discussion with the rank and file. Who will monitor this? Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, stated that GPs would give certificates to people who had had the virus, but doctors have denied that. This is an infringement on civil liberties. We should treat everyone equally, yet we will now discriminate. This is shocking treatment of our young people. Ireland's 18-year-olds are now trying their best to get vaccinated so that they will not be left on the outside. This is compelling them and it is wrong. Backbenchers have been complaining about this legislation in the Chamber all evening, yet they will vote for it later tonight like they do with everything else. Who are they codding? Why is antigen testing not being considered? As I have asked previously, is a member of NPHET gainfully involved in other test kits? It is surprising that the Government did not get the Department to detail this. What is going on? Why do the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the rest of the Government not trust the hospitality sector, including publicans and restaurateurs? All around Kerry, they are the grandest of people who have provided the best of service down the years and abided by every law. How does the Government believe that this can be monitored? Why is it so rushed? Why did the Government not give people a chance to suss it out? People who are 18 years of age will be denied and kept outside after all that has been done to them for the past year and a half. They have been isolated and their lives have been impinged upon. I have people ringing me who cannot get the vaccine. They cannot take it on their GPs' advice. One woman told me yesterday that she, her husband and her son and daughter always used to go to their local pub and asked me whether she would now be kept out because, on her doctor's advice, she could not get the vaccine. She has a blood clotting problem. Others told me that, because they were on blood thinners or the like, they could not get the vaccine either. I know a man who finished up in Cork after his first vaccine dose. He was rushed there because he had a clot in his leg. He is not going to get the second dose, but I will tell the House that that man deserves to get a couple of pints more than anyone else because he works terribly hard to keep his business going. To deny him the right to have a pint is very wrong. The Government does not know what it is at at all. For many reasons, I look forward to the day when we will not have the coronavirus. We will not have the Government dictating to us as it has been. It does not trust good, honest, hard-working publicans and restaurant operators. It is asking them to put people outside to eat. It does not understand. People get much better weather up here in Dublin than we do down in Kerry. It is raining down there every day when I leave it, and when I go back down, it is raining again. The sun is shining outside here. It is fine for the people of Dublin.	spk_346

I want to especially thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill forward and at least we will have a cap. When I hear what Deputy Denis Naughten has come out with, that it will be six years if a couple are named on the deeds, that is not what we signed up to at all. That is bad. Take a farm with the value of €500,000, for example. It would be €7,500 per year per €100,000 so that is €37,500 per year for the young fella or the wife or whoever is trying to fund the person in the nursing home. That is a savage sum of money to come up with and for many it would mean they will lose their farms. They will not be able to hold them. This Bill was supposed to be about fairness in the context of family farms. It would be way easier altogether if the family farm was not assessed and if, like everywhere else, only the family home was assessed. What is being done is not fair to those with family farms. It should not and need not be so complex. There are provisions that the person taking over the farm or running it cannot lease it. If there are young children and the man gets hurt in an accident or whatever, what is the wife supposed to do with the farm? She is not able to farm it and she might have to mind the young children. Take another scenario. The children could be that bit older and might be in college, which means that third level fees have to be paid. Are we going to insist that one of these youngsters drop out of college to start running the farm? Then, at the same time, he or she would have to try to earn €37,500 per year from a €500,000 farm. You will only get an average farm for €500,000. With the revelations that are coming out about joining the couples, I am not at all satisfied that this is happening. We are not treating farm families fairly. It should be the same for every applicant or everyone going into a nursing home in that the family home should be assessed, not the farm. The farm is the source of a family's income. Other people have pensions and different things and maybe they have other jobs but it takes a couple and a family to run a farm. One of them might have to go into a nursing home and the other, like I said, would not be able to farm because he or she would have children to mind or the children might need to go college. I am appealing to the Government to look at this again. It took so long to do this. Questions need to be asked. Since the Government said it was going to bring forward this Bill, people in nursing homes and farmers have been under threat that money would have to be paid back. They have been paying money to nursing homes because I guarantee they would not be in the nursing home if it was not being paid. As a result, there is money owed. These people need to be considered retrospectively. Even going back six years, there are people in nursing homes who we know will lose their farms. I appreciate the Minister of State going at it but the Government has made it more complex by insisting that the land is assessed. I appreciate that other Members want to get in but I am still concerned about what is happening. It is not a fair deal at all; in fact, it is lousy for some farmers.	spk_394

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-07-14	dail	33	Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2021: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_19	On foot of what Dr. Tony Holohan said this evening, the Minister has lost all credibility. He has given different reasons for introducing this Bill but Dr. Holohan said that he did not advise and was not advising that people under 18 years of age should be let into indoor hospitality. That tells me the Government is only making it up as it goes along. What is sad about this, and I support this amendment on the sunset clause, is that the people who will be affected by this are, first, the young people who could not avail of the vaccine yet. As we have been and are debating here, they are doing everything possible to try to get vaccinated so they will not be left outside. We know what they have suffered. Everybody says that it was the young and very old who suffered the most during the pandemic. I agree with that. Our youngsters behaved very well during the time they were not supposed to do this and that. The Minister should know that if he blackguards youngsters, they will never forget. They will never forget this, which is creating a two-tier society. It is undemocratic and unfair. I cannot stand or vote for that. The Minister has to realise that there are people who, for medical reasons, could not avail of the vaccine. In the medical advice from their general practitioners, they were advised against taking the vaccine. They would have liked to get it like everybody else but they were advised not to and had to abide by their medical advice. Therefore, they cannot go into indoor hospitality, be it into a pub with their husband or into a restaurant with other family members who are vaccinated. They will have to be left outside. A woman on the telephone to me today was very critical. She asked me if I was going to vote to keep her apart from her family. There have been others as well. At this late stage, I ask the Minister to cop on, do the right thing and open it up for everyone. It is clear that the Government is just making it up as it goes along. It is like a lifetime ago but the sector was supposed to be open for 5 July. However, a few days before that, the Minister did not realise this and that and said he was keeping it closed a lot longer. Then he formulated this very poor attempt for opening up. Why does he not trust the publicans and the people who run the small restaurants and indoor cafes? They can keep people apart. They can do what they have always done, which is run their businesses well in Killarney and in rural places in Kerry such as Gneeveguilla, Scartaglin, Rathmore, Cromane, Fieries and Currow. I think of all those grand people who have provided this service for years and over the generations, with businesses handed down from one to the other, sometimes going back five generations. The Minister will not trust them to reopen like all the other sectors of society. Consider the North of Ireland. It is only an hour and a half up the road from here. People in all of Kerry are booking rooms and travelling up to the North for weekends, to such an extent that we could not get rooms for people who are going there to get their cataracts removed in two weeks' time or less. It is absolutely ridiculous. What is the Minister at? Why is he trying to hold a grip on the people? Why does he not just be fair about it, rather than have this two-tier society by letting in some and keeping others out? Other Members wish to speak. This is totally and absolutely ridiculous. It is creating a division in our society by leaving people at home and not letting them have a small bit of a social life for the rest of what is left of the summer. The heart is gone out of the summer already.	spk_461
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-07-14	dail	33	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: From the Seanad	dbsect_25	"Of course the sequestering of carbon will have to be counted. My worry from the outset was that farmers would not be allowed the carbon they sequestered. I contend that many farmers are sequestering more carbon than they are producing. I worry that the calculations are supposed to take seven years to account for what farmers are sequestering and how efficient they are. Many farmers are very efficient and have gone to extremes and much expense so that they would not be damaging the environment. That has to be recognised. The scientist who claimed more than 15 years ago that cattle were producing so much methane and were damaging the environment has now admitted that his calculations were two thirds wrong. Imagine that after all the racket about methane gas. He admitted it late last year. That is very serious. I cannot think of his name. We contend that even farmers who are in dairy, given the amount of grass they grow, should get credit for the carbon they are sequestering. We hear about climate justice and see what is happening. We know the cost of diesel and petrol has gone up by so much recently but so is percentage the Government is getting from the carbon tax. People in rural Ireland have to use petrol and diesel because they have to get from A to B; they have to get to work and do their harvesting with tractors or whatever. Diesel has gone up 50% from last year. The Minister was absolutely delighted today. He purchased three new buses at the cost of €800,000 a piece. They will be more costly to run than any bus. Good friends have told me that hydrogen will cost €20 per kg and it will take 27 kg to do 430 km. That is more than €500. I look around this city day after day at big, tall and long double-decker buses and there is no more than one or two people in them at any time and yet the people in rural Ireland are penalised and must pay for these brand-new shiny buses that are not even economical. It is wrong. There is no justice in that for the people who are out early in the morning in the dark, the cold and the wet, travelling long distances to work, because that is what they have to do, whereas in this city there are so many buses pulling up on Kildare Street and so many have one or two people on them. This is not climate justice. We have to ensure that biodigesters and the methane they produce can be used to produce energy. One farmer was recently refused planning permission for a biodigester. This is the country we are in. Farmers are trying to do their best and people are complaining that farmers are not being penalised enough but they are. The Minister must realise that and do something to make sure farmers are properly compensated for the carbon emissions they are sequestering. A farmers' group raised the issue that farmers should be compensated for forestry that they have grown. Lo and behold, the Department officials said ""Sure we gave you premiums for that"". That premium was only a help. The premiums are all cut now and people cannot get licences to fell the tress that they were told to grow, and now the Department will not allow them to claim for sequestering carbon in these forests. The Minister is very unfair if this is the route he wants to take with people who planted these forests, not allowing them to cut them down. There was a grand group of people outside today, honest, hard-working people. Then there are the two Ministers telling them they are doing their best for them. They have done nothing at all for them since the Government got into power 12 months ago."	spk_489

I refer to fishermen operating right around our coasts from Castletownbere, Dingle and Berehaven and all areas along the west coast, whether in counties Mayo, Donegal or wherever. These fishermen have been badly let down. Being let down is now being compounded by other issues as well, including the sacking of the former European Commissioner, Phil Hogan, and two Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This all happened while the important CAP talks were going on and it meant that we had no organised attempt to defend our fishermen. Their quotas have been further reduced and they are not getting the protection of our marine protection vessels that are supposed to defend them. They have been badly let down. Indeed, this group of people came, at savage expense, up the Liffey and moored their boats on the river here across from the convention centre. To say that they had organised and thought out their entire protest and presentation would be an understatement. They were very organised. Perhaps 20 of those fishermen spoke one after the other and no one repeated what the first fella had said. Their stories were very interesting and they made a real impression on me and all the elected Members to whom I spoke about the protest. It was the most organised demonstration that I have seen in front of us during the six years I have been representing the county of Kerry.  No proper attempt was made at the talks on fishing in Brussels, and I think we were not even represented at some of those talks. That is how bad the story is. Yet, the French Government made sure that it got what it wanted for its fishermen. It did not let its crowd down. I can honestly say, however, that our fishermen have been let down. They are not looking for handouts. All they want is more fishing quota. This weighing regime that the fishermen are being asked to undertake is not being required of foreign fishermen landing catches in harbours on our shores. This measure must be got rid of right away. Our fishermen need protection when foreign boats are threatening or ramming them. They are not getting that protection. I really appreciate the fishermen. I know a lot of them who are based along the coast. They work part time at fishing and do a small bit of farming and maybe a small bit of building. By massive ingenuity, they eke out a living. They need fishing to be protected. We cannot let them die away. I can see what it costs to put fishing vessels to sea, because those boats do not land out of the sky.There is massive expense there. Can the Minister imagine how they are suffering with the cost of diesel and fuel since the increase, and being charged carbon tax on top of it?	spk_551

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-07-14	dail	33	Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_44	I am glad to get the opportunity to support this amendment. As I understand it, the property tax was meant to be a residential tax. It now looks like if the farmer has a henhouse or a dog house, those hens or dogs will be charged the property tax as well. The amount of land around the property is to be increased to a hectare, which is 2.5 acres, which is totally unfair. This is like the fair deal scheme, where the farm is assessed but for everybody else, a residential property is assessed. We are taxing the farmer under the name of the property tax for 2.5 acres, which is totally wrong. The local improvement scheme in Kerry had 697 roads on the list starting this year and we got funding for seven of them. That is the truth. I have said before that the people of rural Ireland are entitled to a good road to their door just like the people in Dublin 4. We see today how €2.4 million was paid for three buses here in Dublin, as if there are not enough buses in Dublin. They go in sets of four or five up and down every street with only one or two people in them. There is no bus service, meanwhile, for most of rural Ireland. The Government is away with the fairies. There is no funding for group water schemes or people cannot afford them. As I stated yesterday, water is an essential service. There was much hullabaloo in Dublin about getting free water but people in Kerry cannot get water even if they pay for it. They are being asked to pay €8,000 or €10,000 per house in order to get on a group scheme from Kerry County Council but, lo and behold, Irish Water wants €2,000 added to the fee as well. It is the last straw that breaks the camel's back. There are five group water schemes in Kerry not going ahead because of that. I ask the Minister to tackle Irish Water about the process, which is totally unfair. Water is essential. There has been much hullabaloo about charges and the people of rural Ireland were not considered at all because they provide their own water. When applying for planning permission to build a house, most people have to drill their own wells or get a supply from a water course etc. That is without any help from the State to provide the service. All it would rather do is stop people building in the first place. These people are providing their own site. In many cases, rural cottages are hardly being built at all in Kerry. We had people like Mr. John O'Donoghue of Farranfore and the late Mr. Paddy Gallagher of Valentia Island, who built many rural cottages around County Kerry. We seem to be going away from that because from 2016 to 2021, there was funding for only 13 rural cottages from approximately 60 applications. The rest have been left to go whistle. People cannot get a demountable home. It is happening on practically a daily or weekly basis that a farmer - a man or woman - might have a house that is run down and people cannot live in it. We used to have a service where a demountable home could be brought out from the local authority but that is not happening at all in Kerry now. It is saying they do not have the funding for it. It is very wrong. These people may be in their 60s and want to live out their lives where they were born, bred and reared. It is where they have a few cattle, sheep and other animals. They are being denied that right. Any good thing we had, this Government and the most recent previous Governments have got rid of it. The Government now wants to put a charge on the 2.5 acres around a house, which is totally wrong.It shows for certain we have a Dublin Government looking after Dublin. We heard what the Tánaiste said about how something will have to be done about the property values in Dublin for houses that are worth millions, and that the property tax will have to be reduced for them, whereas it will be increased in the rural areas and counties like Kerry. This is despite us not having the services people in the urban areas have. I am supporting this amendment because the people of rural Ireland are being let down again and this is another attack.	spk_576

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-07-13	dail	33	Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_38	I am glad to get an opportunity to talk about the property tax and the new formulas that are being brought in. It is ironic this change is being introduced just as we are emerging from a gigantic public health pandemic. People are still worried, confused and out of sorts after being isolated. They are very worried about themselves and their families and now this is another concern. People do not mind paying if they get something in return. The property tax is very unfair in that regard. In rural areas, farmers and many others get very little in return for this tax. An example of this is the local improvement scheme list in Kerry, which numbered 697 at the start of the year. We have only got enough funding for seven roads. Deputy Griffin said we got a 5% increase, but in fact we will not be doing as many roads this year as we did last year. We got enough for just ten roads last year and only seven this year. People in rural Ireland deserve a good road to their door just as much as do the people in Dublin 4. I have consistently said that but it is not happening. The scheme was suspended for six or seven years, then a new list was looked for and the people who were waiting since 2008 are still waiting. It is not fair. These are not private roads. The criterion for applying for the local improvement scheme is that you must have two or more landholdings. It is not applicable to one private house. On many of these roads, there are 20 or 30 houses, with farmers and others living up and down the way. The roads are in a terrible state and are not in the charge of the county council. That is just one issue I need to get across. The officials in the Department of Finance need to realise these are public roads, not private roads. They are public rights of way. Water is an essential service. In Kerry, we have a serious problem with group water schemes not going ahead because, as well as residents having to pay €8,000 or €10,000 per house along the line, Irish Water is now looking for €2,000 on top of that. This is double charging and it is not acceptable. When I think of Dublin and other cities, I do not begrudge anyone anything but the people there have all the services, including all the new buses. You might see three or four of them passing one after the other and only two or three people in each of them. We cannot get that kind of service in rural Kerry. Then we have a scenario where a small bridge or a large culvert, as we call it in many places, will not be replaced for 12 months or a year and a half because there are so many environmental and other assessments to be done. In the case of one particular bridge in Kilgarvan, Gort Bridge, the material that built it in 1880 or whatever was brought in a horse and cart. It has been closed for almost a year and a half and work on it will not be allowed to go ahead. It was the same in Gortdarrig and Headford. There was a slip on the road from the Top of Coom to Ballingeary and it was almost two years before it was repaired. People had to go around it. If those things happened in Dublin, Cork or any of the other cities, the repairs would be done right away. The property tax will hit pensioners very hard, especially where there is only one pensioner in a large house. People want to stay in the house in which they gave all their lives. They are suffering hard and the increase in the property tax is going to affect them. Where there are two pensioners together, they can help each other to pay the bills, but it is very hard for people on their own. The funeral grant has been abolished and people worry about being able to pay for their funeral. Every extra cent they must pay will hurt them. The Tánaiste said that something has to be done for people with Dublin properties that are of a very high value. I suppose the reason the value of houses has gone up is because of their scarcity. If the Government went back to the traditional house building, where local authorities were given funding to buy a site and build the houses, that would be cheaper than all the schemes that are in place at present, such as the rental accommodation scheme, the housing assistance payment scheme and all these things. They are costing money and the State is finishing up with nothing to show for them. On top of the property tax, people in rural Ireland have to contend with the price of fuel, which has gone up massively. It has not gone unnoticed by people in rural areas. The addition of the carbon tax on top of it is making fuel very expensive. Every day, you would nearly be afraid to look at the sign beside the pump because the price has gone up a couple of cent more. Where is it going to stop? I am very worried about the inclusion of sheds and garages and land up to an acre in these provisions. That is going to hurt people in rural Ireland with farms. What is the necessity of it? It is like the fair deal scheme, which I have been very opposed to, under which the farm is assessed as well as the house. That is very wrong and it is wrong as well to include up to an acre of land under these provisions. Again, it is not fair because people in urban areas do not have an acre and do not have to pay it, but farmers and others in rural areas will. In fact, it is up to a hectare, which is 2.5 acres. That is a lot of land. What value is going to be put on it? I am very worried about this and it needs to be clarified. Then we have the proposal that if the valuation given by the householder is not accepted, the figure the Revenue Commissioners assume the house should be valued at will come into play. It seems to me there could a lot of room for increasing the value of a house and perhaps creating an unfair valuation because the person in Revenue, or whoever it is, may be from Dublin or another urban area. If a house is situated in the middle of a farm, it is just the place where the farmer lives. It does not have the same value as a house in Dublin 4 or wherever because the farm is around and it cannot be treated the very same. People cannot pay another cent and that is it. They have so many things to contend with, whether it is the USC, which was brought in as a temporary measure, motor tax or any of the other charges people in rural Ireland face. If you are building a new house, you have to pay lots of levies, including a road levy. A levy to assist with roads must be paid but a cent might never be spent on the road up to the new house a young fellow is building. The cost of an ESB connection is unreal, depending on the number of poles or whatever. Turning to broadband, we do not have that service in many places in Kerry. People are trying to improvise and pay others to try to bring broadband to them. It is a different story in rural Ireland. People in rural Ireland are not getting the services that people in urban areas are getting. That should be recognised when all this is being decided. This Bill is vague, but I am concerned for the people of rural Kerry that I represent.	spk_328

My thoughts go out to the parents, sisters, brothers and families that have been left behind. Their lives will never again be the same. May God give them the strength to carry on and continue with their lives in the best way that they can. It reminds us of what true loss is. While we are here today to talk about post offices, tragedies like this are a terrible infliction on families. I hope that the little boy who is very hurt recovers. We are now being told that there will to be a 20% cut in State payments to post offices. That will signal the end of many. Post offices only ever wanted more work. Direct Government intervention through a PSO of €17 million is needed to ensure that our post office network stays intact. Some 281 have been closed in the past decade in 25 of the 26 counties. I need not name the county that was not affected. It is ironic to hear the Labour Party Member regretting the closure of the post offices. When they were in power from 2011 to 2016, they closed 218 of them. All that postmasters want is more work. They could deal with motor tax, licence renewals, registrations, identity verification and community information. When the country was broke and we had nothing, we had post offices, Garda stations and GPs in every parish. Deputy Griffin talked about the local improvement scheme for rural roads.

I think of poor Emma Mhic Mhathúna, who lived in Dingle in our county for a while. My sympathy goes out to her family and to the families of all the other women who lost their lives because of incorrect diagnoses. Emma was a witty and charming woman who fought as hard as she could up to the very end. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and with the families of all the other women. The worst part of this whole saga, in addition to the incorrect diagnoses, is the length of time it took for women and their families to be informed that incorrect diagnoses had been made. We all know that time is crucial with regard to cancer diagnoses. Outcomes are very different where there is delay. People should be brought to task. Whether it was Dr. Tony Holohan or someone else who was responsible for the delay, there are certainly questions to be answered because time is so important. More than 200 people got the wrong results and there was a great delay in informing many of them. We applaud Vicky Phelan for the fight she has put up on her own behalf and on behalf of all of the women who were affected. Another thing is happening and has happened. More people are dying as a result of another delay, one which has continued since the Covid pandemic began. Many people with other serious issues are affected, including a man I know whose wife told me he has just four months to live. He was supposed to have been seen after his first round of treatment in January of this year. This was delayed and put back from month to month. It was only last month, in June, that he was seen. It had spread all over him. He has a young family and a young wife. I know there are miracles but it is unlikely that he will survive. I am very sorry for him. There are many others suffering such delays. We know that Covid is very serious and had to be dealt with but people with other medical problems should not have had their treatment held up as it has been, and is being, held up. I have asked the Government before to ensure that does not happen anymore. It needs to get its house in order because it is not in order. People from Kerry are facing delays in being seen.  I cannot understand why the Government is cutting the time so tight in extending the deadline to, possibly, 26 July 2022. Why can it not be extended to sometime in 2024 or 2025? Some women may live longer and come forward later. I ask the Government to give them more time. Why is it trying to cut the time? It is not a grant for which farmers are applying. It is a serious matter and these women are entitled to get retribution, to be shown respect and to be treated properly in light of the wrongs that have been done to them. I cannot see why it should be limited to July 2022. While I welcome its extension to 26 July 2022, I ask the Government to extend it for a couple of years beyond that to give women a chance to come forward. This is a desperate scenario. People were given the wrong information. We all trust medical advice and are taught to respect it but the wrong advice was given and someone should have to explain why and why it took so long - three or four years - to inform the women involved. That is where the desperate wrong was done. I ask the Government to ensure all of these women are treated fairly because they have not been treated fairly up to this point.	spk_276
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-07-07	dail	33	Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_22	There is a need for support for businesses that may not be closed but do not have as much business as they had heretofore. County Kerry predominantly relies on tourism. Suppliers of fish and meat that were supplying hotels, restaurants and small hostelry businesses have not been able to command as much business as they could previously. They are very worried that they will have to shed employees or close down altogether because their business has been seriously impacted, even though they have not been ordered to close. As a result of other businesses being closed, they have been hurt very badly. I refer to people such as taxi drivers or bus operators. Taxi drivers have been told they will go back for a few weeks but they can see trouble looming. When the local people who are on vacation dry up or children go back to school at the end of August or in early September, they may not be able to survive. In fact, they believe they will not be able to survive without payments. Even drivers working for other operators who have gone back to work are very concerned and will need the pandemic payment to be continued, at least until the season begins next March, by which stage we hope everything will be back to normal. The Minister needs to consider their needs. I am asking him to consider the needs of those in the two sectors I have mentioned. There are other businesses that are semi-operational but, as tourists are no longer coming in their droves and business is not at the level it was previously, they will not be able to continue. They are very keen to stay working and would be delighted to be able to continue working but that is not going to happen.	spk_372
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-07-07	dail	33	Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_22	There was a lot of merit in the Minister's first amendment. There are many good points in the Bill but lumping the proposal under discussion into the Bill is like putting the fox in with the hens. It is not compatible at all and it is not fair. A few weeks ago, we had a Bill here decrying the bulk-buying of homes in estates by entities and the outbidding of young people, including young couples, who want to put a roof over their heads. The same entities are being given an advantage again by reducing their stamp duty. If the Government wants to reduce the stamp duty, that is fine but it should do so for everyone and have a level playing pitch. The proposal is not fair at all. Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett and I may not agree on cutting turf and things like that but we do agree on this. If the Minister wants to provide housing for people — there is a housing issue — he should go back to basics such as buying sites around towns and villages and giving funding to the local authorities to build houses. I have nothing against developers or anyone. I disagree with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett in that there is nothing wrong with making money but it should be made fairly. An advantage should not be given to certain investors — perhaps foreign investors in this case — so they can outbid local young fellows who want to put a roof over their heads. The prospects are slipping away from young people in spite of everything because the cost of materials is going up and they cannot provide houses for themselves. An unfair advantage is being given to the entities by reducing the stamp duty. After a few years, the stamp duty will not matter because the funds will have availed of the relief and will have blown young people out of the property market, denying them the right to put a roof over their heads. It is very unfair.	spk_380
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-07-07	dail	33	Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2021: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_31	I too want clarification or to be assured by the Minister that what we are doing tonight will allow planning permission to be extended for people who are building their own homes, who fully intended doing so in the past 12 months or so, and then were refused funds by the banks or lending institutions because one or other person in a couple, or both, were on the pandemic unemployment payment. Many banks and lending institutions refused to give them money, so planning and building have been stalled. In other instances where people wanted to apply for retention and where their planning was running out for commercial developments, they could not process their applications and get them together because architects and engineers were slow to come out as they were working from home. Many projects needed interaction with planners and various bodies to get going and they were held up. Is the scenario I outlined first where people want to build homes for themselves included? In County Kerry, planning permission is for five years and then there is an extension for another five years to ten years but there are cases where people were at the end of the period and they were refused funds. Are those the types of scenario to which the Minister will give an extension of two years? If he does, I would support the measure because there is a need for it.	spk_410

As matters stand, pensioners have no rights to be included in negotiations. That is wrong. We need to ensure that people have an adequate and a fair pension when they reach 65 years of age. This has not been happening and pensioners have not had a voice. We thank the former ESB workers who gave valuable service and came out in the dark of night and turned on the power. We also thank telecom and local authority workers. Going back in time, they came out when roads were blocked by trees across in the middle of the night. Now they are at a vulnerable stage and time is not on their side. I ask the Minister of State not to kick this any further down the road or delay because time is not on the side of these people.  The women of Ireland who raised the current generation have not been treated fairly or adequately with their pensions. Many people who gave their lives and showed such dedication have not been properly looked after. In the case of forestry workers, I know well how hard they worked for Coillte and the State. Whether it was early or late, they worked from start to finish, from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. They did not stop, even with midges and every other misfortune on top of them. They are appealing now for fair play and I am asking on their behalf that they be included and get their proper increases as they fall due.	spk_36

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-06-30	dail	33	Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_20	I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on behalf of the people of Kerry. The Government and the Minister are behind the curve again with this Bill to legalise outdoors drinking. I welcome that but the Government was wrong and not at the races when it advised people to drink outside when there was no law to ensure it was legal. I submitted a parliamentary question last October asking whether the law had changed or was going to be changed in relation to outside drinking. On our licence it states we are licensed to sell beer and tobacco to be consumed on the premises. Nothing could be clearer than that. Members of the Government were not aware of that until the Garda in Galway woke them up and they decided to do this. Now we are voting to appoint judges as well. Why could there not be a separate Bill for that? I welcome what many pubs have done. They have spent a great deal of money to provide outdoor seating and umbrellas to keep people comfortable. I am glad what they are doing now will not be treated as illegal and they will be operating legally. However, I see this will mean off-licences will also be allowed to sell drink for consumption in public places. That is what is happening. At the same time, owners of indoor hospitality businesses will have to keep looking out the window and not letting anyone in. These are small pubs, restaurants and cafés that have given great service over the years, some going back three, four or five generations of families. I do not understand where the Government was at. Where has the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, been for the past number of weeks? He was clearly absent and not at the wheel. It now seems that Dr. Tony Holohan and his outfit run the country and dictate what must happen. Groups of people, even from Kerry, are travelling up the North of Ireland for stag parties and other occasions. What is different about the Six Counties? We are not going to Europe at all. The rest of Europe and the world is open but the Twenty-six Counties will not be open. According to George Lee, we will not be let open until after October. The Government is asking the vintners today to provide a plan. What good is asking them now when the decision has been made? The Government made the decision yesterday to keep small hospitality services closed indefinitely. That is wrong. There is a suggestion that young people have to be vaccinated but there are no vaccines to be got. It is very unfair. People who owned pubs, restaurants and cafés for generations have their heads down today and are disappointed. Many people around the country are thinking the same way. They feel the Government is inept, not at the wheel and not in charge. I agree with them. It is a disaster to do this to hard-working people who were the pillars of society and gave to charities and provided sponsorships over the years. They have been totally let down. The longer they are kept closed - and it looks like the Government will keep them closed for a long time - the more of them will never reopen. It is a sad day for people in Scartaglen, Gneevegullia, Currow, all those fine places, back around Sneem and the Inny Tavern.	spk_260
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-06-30	dail	33	Land Development Agency Bill 2021: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_27	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important topic. Many Deputies have done a great deal of talking and it is time for action. I appreciate that the Minister is doing his best in the position he now holds and I have confidence that he will continue trying to do that. We disagree about certain matters. I am worried that, down the line, this legislation will erode the powers of elected members and local authorities. I am also worried that the LDA might be accountable to no one. Publicly owned land should be used 100% for social housing. Making some parts of a development private and others affordable and social will not work.Each development on public lands should be publicly owned. Houses should be built to be rented. Affordable houses should be built to be sold. If possible, sites should be sold to couples or individuals who want to build a house. If they qualify for social housing, they should be allowed to buy a site. I am very worried about the publicly owned lands we have in Killarney, like the very valuable St. Finan's site. I have been striving for many years to ensure this land is transferred from the HSE back to Kerry County Council, from where it came from in the first place, and that local authority houses would be built on that site. We need them in Killarney. Builders and developers are doing a great job where they can, but they are up against it at present with the cost of materials, especially timber. If a person is looking for timber for a house in Kerry, there is a six-week waiting time and suppliers will not say how much it will cost until it arrives. At the same time, we cannot fell trees in our forestry. In Ireland, no one can get a felling licence, yet in Germany and other countries, there is no such thing as a felling licence. It is well known that when one plants a forestry, it has to be cut down when it is mature and available. Now we are importing timber. The regulator we have is against one-off houses, people who are trying to build houses themselves. Those people should be supported in every way. There are several designations preventing them from building at this time. It is difficult to get planning in many parts of County Kerry. That is not right because all people want to do is to put a roof over their heads and make a home. They should get every assistance in doing that from us, as elected Members of the Oireachtas, and from the Department, the Minister, the Government and the local authorities. They are finding it very difficult at present. We have been told that money is no object, that houses will be built and that there is no problem, yet we have major problems with sewerage infrastructure as there are places with no facilities. There are 32 settlements in Kerry that have no sewerage treatment facility. There are 17 towns and villages waiting for extensions to their plants. People cannot build in the town of Kenmare. They can get planning permission but they cannot build there until the treatment plant is extended. Zoning and dezoning designation is what is happening in Kerry. The local authority members have been told they can increase the amount of land zoned around Killarney, but they must dezone land in places like Rathmore and outside of that area. That is not fair, nor is it right because people want to live in their areas. They are being denied that right by two things - zoning designations and the non-existent sewerage facilities. It is a problem in places like Beaufort which is a large village that could expand but has no treatment plant. There are two housing estates there that are in a terrible state. The local authority has to draw the sewage out of the estates every week and bring it into the Killarney treatment plant. Things like that are happening in Currow. There is no treatment plant in Scartaglen or Asdee. There are honest good hardworking people from those places and they deserve to be able to put a roof over their heads. It is not right, and I appeal to the Minister to deal with that issue. The Government says money is not a problem. It may not be nice to speak about sewage in this House, but if people do not have proper facilities, they cannot build homes. It is very important that we raise this matter. Small-scale builders and developers are finding it very difficult to continue because of the levies, regulations and VAT. They have all those things to deal with while they have to carry the costs. It is very difficult to get money from the banks. The Minister must consider this issue. They have to carry the cost to the very end because stage payments are not allowed anymore. There are many small-scale builders and developers who are going out of business because they cannot continue. If you have no money, you have no fun. That is the situation with small-scale builders and developers now. They cannot afford to carry the full costs.	spk_336

Certainly, we must ensure that there is an extension of at least two years. We have many problems in County Kerry with regard to planning and building houses. While Dublin has its problems, we have our own different problems in Kerry. We have designations such as urban-generated pressure, which is to prevent people from a town or village building outside the town or village. On top of that, it hurts the people who have lived in those areas all their lives. Only family members can get permission in these urban-generated pressure zones. Someone could have lived next door all their life and been brought up there. That person will not be considered for permission at all, even if he or she gets a site from his or her neighbour, friend or whoever at a reasonable price. That person is condemned to building or buying in a town or village where the prices are exorbitant. That is the truth in Killarney, Tralee, Dingle and other places. People cannot go outside the town or village where they could get a site. This is hurting ordinary couples who just want to put a roof over their heads. Another core group of people are also being denied. Villages such as Brosna, Asdee, Scartaglin, Castleisland and Currow have no sewerage scheme. It is a pity for Deputies to break up or change guard in the middle of one's presentation. Many villages and towns do not have a sewerage scheme. Yet, the regulator is saying people cannot build one-off houses in the country but must build them in the town. Places such as Beaufort have no sewerage plant. As I said, we also have places like Currow. None of those villages can expand or develop because they do not even have a sewerage scheme. The regulator is telling people and the local authority that it cannot allow one-off houses here or there, and puts in special designations. That is very unfair and hard on people because they have no options. The Minister must realise that. Perhaps the Minister does not realise that because he is a Dublin Deputy, and that is fine. He does not, however, understand what is happening in County Kerry when the regulator comes down. Why even have councillors in the Killorglin municipal area? They zoned two or three acres for Mick O'Connell - the most famous footballer of all time. They granted him zoning to build three houses. The regulator came down and did not even send a message. It does not even know where Valentia Island is and it stopped him building and zoning the land, for which the councillors voted. That is very wrong. I say, either zone plenty of land or do not zone any land. Let every planning application stand on its own two feet.	spk_179
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-06-29	dail	33	Affordable Homes in the Poolbeg Strategic Development Zone: Motion	dbsect_17	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about affordable housing because it is a very serious problem. There are many young couples watching us this evening who are wondering if they will ever be able to put a roof over their heads. It is a natural desire for any couple or young person to put a roof over their heads and to own their home but it is becoming increasingly difficult because of the cost of materials and the difficulties with securing planning permission in rural areas, especially in rural parts of Kerry. I spoke earlier about difficulties with designations that are applied on the insistence of the regulator and the planning authorities which must be adhered to by the local authorities. One problem is the urban generated pressure clause which was designed, wrongly, to stop people coming out from towns and villages and building in rural areas. It is also wrong because it stops a local person in the area from getting planning permission because such permission will only be granted to the landowner's son or daughter. That clause is wrong because people should be entitled to get planning permission to build where they want to build their permanent residence. I would not mind a clause being put on them if they got the permission and they would not mind it either. That is one of the issues. The regulator is blocking people from getting planning permission in other rural areas and insisting that permission not be granted in different places. Then, when planning is granted by Kerry County Council some nasty individual appeals the decision to An Bord Pleanála, as An Taisce has done many times, making life miserable for many families. Kerry County Council grants the permission, someone appeals it to An Bord Pleanála and even though the inspector who comes down agrees with the local authority, lo and behold, when the decision goes back to An Bord Pleanála it is refused for some reason and the couple or young person are denied the planning permission they should have got. I agree with previous speakers on sewerage and water facilities. In Kerry, we have 32 villages without a sewerage facility. Places like Scartaglin, Curragh, Asdee, Caherdaniel and Ballinskellligs cannot expand or grow because they do not have a sewerage facility. As has been said, the Government and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will have to step in and assist Irish Water because it does not have the funds to put all these schemes in place. All that Irish Water is compelled and liable to do is maintain the facilities that are there already and it is put to the pin of its collar doing that. In places like Kenmare or Castleisland, people can get planning permission for a development but they cannot build the houses until the sewerage schemes are put in place, extended and expanded. Some 17 towns and villages are waiting on plans to rejuvenate and bring their sewerage schemes up to standard. The regulator is continuously interfering with zoning and it is dezoning lands. We have Ministers saying they want to build affordable houses. How can housing and affordable housing be built if most of the land in any one settlement is being dezoned? In most cases, the regulator will only allow one plot of land in each settlement to be zoned. That is wrong because it gives the individual who owns such a plot on that side of the village or town a monopoly and the owner can charge what he or she likes. We are talking about affordability but that is out the window when there is no competition for prices. As I have said previously, we should zone plenty of land and let the market decide where the houses will be built. Alternatively, we should not zone any land and let every planning application be decided either by the local authority or An Bord Pleanála, depending on its size. If we forgot about zoning, it would be way fairer as it would allow single applicants to buy a site close to the village or town and build on it because the land would not have to be zoned, as it must be at present. I had a case recently involving a young couple in a small village who applied for planning permission outside of the village and they were refused because the land was not zoned. They could not buy a site in the little village or town because it was not available. The Ministers have to wake up to these facts. I heard Deputy Naughten talking about building social housing or two-bedroom bungalows for older people. I would like to take him down to Rathmore in Kerry where Jerh O'Donoghue and the Rathmore Social Action Group have been successfully housing elderly couples and even single people for years. The group should be complimented, especially Mr. O'Donoghue on the foresight and vision he had in what he has done and what he is continuing to do with his team around him. I also compliment Michael Cronin of Thermohouse Ireland on the great work it is doing in building voluntary social housing in Killarney, Milltown and different towns and villages. I also compliment KPH Construction, which is doing much the same in Barraduff. It deserves credit for the high standard of houses it is building. On felling licences, we hear about the increased cost of materials and timber, which is going up and up. Anyone who wants timber to build a house in Kerry must wait for six weeks for delivery and suppliers will not know or cannot tell people what the price will be until they land with the timber because it is going up and up in price and is being imported. At the same time, in Germany and other countries, no felling licence is required because when someone plants forestry it is recognised that it will have to be cut down at some stage. If people were granted permission to plant forestry, they should not need a felling licence, either to thin or clearfell it at any time. The quicker we realise that, the better because our forestry industry has gone down the swanny. Job after job is being lost and contractors that had specialised gear and equipment for cutting and drawing out timber, including forwarders and all those kind of things, have either gone to Scotland or they have gone bust. The Government will have to wake up to the fact that this is happening. I hope it is listening because it is a serious matter. More things are being lost during the reign of this Government than during any previous Government, and this is one of the most serious of them. On the tenant purchase scheme, a number of years ago, people could rent out a council house and after a year or two or a number of years, they were entitled to purchase it under a scheme. Some 80% of the applicants to the scheme are being refused. The Government needs to look at that scheme because it was an important and valuable one. People got on their feet after renting for a certain number of years and they were able to purchase their house. They are being denied that option that was in place all the years past. That money was used to do up voids. We have 162 voids in Kerry because the county council has no funds to bring them up to the standard that is required. That is a very serious matter and if the Government is talking about affordable houses and all of that, it has to look at all of those things.	spk_217

It is a massive inconvenience to go on a five- or seven-mile detour for farmers, contractors and school buses. Even the ambulance came up on the wrong side for one very sick man and was delayed by over an hour finding the way back to where it should have been. It is all because of statutory processes that the Department is requesting, including environmental and planning assessments for structures that have been in place for more than 140 years. If this was in Dublin or Cork city, people would not be inconvenienced to this extent. Why are we allowing this to happen?	spk_150

I appreciate the attempts that have been made to reduce the cost of renting for students and, indeed, for all renters. There are many of them out there. Something needed to be done because some landlords were looking for two months' rent as a deposit and a month's rent upfront. For many people, that is not attainable. They cannot pay that amount and have not been able to do so. One of the biggest hurdles that a family has to overcome is to provide the necessary funds for accommodation when their son or daughter comes of age and needs to go to university. Many people are lucky enough to get the SUSI grant, but many other members of hardworking families do not qualify for the grant. Whatever happens with Covid-19 pandemic, I appeal to the Minister of State not to let happen what happened last August, when the Government advised that colleges were opening. Families from all over, including Kerry and west Cork, drove to places such as Cork, Limerick and Galway cities, and indeed to Dublin, to look for accommodation for their sons and daughters. They paid deposits and rent for accommodation that was not used and had great difficulty in getting their money back. Surely, the Government knew in the days leading up to the start of September and the start of term that the colleges were not going to open. I do not believe the Government is going to allow the pubs to open for indoor dining and drinking given the way it is talking. I would say it is after changing its tune. I hope it does not change its tune on the students like it did last year. Many of them did not get their money back. That was very unfair and wrong. Of course, the way to sort it out is to build more accommodation. The Minister has stood up on various days and said money is not an obstacle. If money is not an obstacle, put the bloody money on the table and build apartments in places such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway for the students. It is an awful problem and issue. There is a big event in every family's life when one, two, three or four children go to university. They are entitled to do so. They are entitled to be educated to the highest degree. I am glad that, back over the years, Irish students have graduated and become professors, engineers, teachers, doctors and surgeons. We are proud of them but we need that to continue. We need to ensure accommodation is available. Costs are spiralling in the building industry. We see ridiculous things happening. Despite what the Green Party is saying, the cost of insulation is going up. It is applying the highest rate of VAT to it. What do the Greens stand for if they do not back up what they have been talking about? What have they been doing? They should not think they can cod the people because that will not happen. They might cod some of the people some of the time and all of the people some of the time but they will not cod all of the people all of the time. The time is drawing in on them now-----	spk_234

It may be construed that I have a conflict of interest because my company sometimes works on repairing and replacing water mains. However, in many parts of Kerry, especially mid-Kerry and the Killarney area, residents, businesses and hotels are faced with a constant barrage of outages day after day. Residents in places like Barleymount, Aghadoe, Laharan, Pallas and Beaufort, from the Gap of Dunloe and all along the board of works road from Beaufort to Gearagh Cross, people are tormented. People in the areas of Faha, Listry, Foynes, Milltown, Castlemaine and Farranfore are suffering outages day after day. Even New Street in Killarney town had one the day before yesterday. The long and the short of it is the shambolic condition of the pipe network is the cause, much of which is obsolete and contains asbestos that needs to be replaced. Many of these asbestos pipes have exceeded their 35-year lifespan, which means they should be replaced. The large asbestos pipe on the central regional water supply from Lough Guitane through Killarney to Tralee, supplying our hospitals and more than 60,000 customers, is in a precarious condition and needs to be urgently replaced. More often than not, it breaks in Farranfore on the N22. If it were not for our excellent Kerry County Council water repair crews, under Freddie Bartlett and others, who use their vast experience, intelligence and expertise to repair the pipes as quickly as possible, save as much as water possible, build up the pressure and restore the supply to customers, the situation would be very much worse.  I also thank the fire brigade, which has had to be brought in recently to replenish water supplies in the Killarney and Aghadoe areas. It cannot be right that the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and local authorities want these crews to move across to Irish Water. These crews include engineers, technicians and general operatives who have given valuable service. It is not fair or right to put them under such pressure to move across to Irish Water. Many of them have worked for 20, 30 and even up to 40 years repairing water supplies for Kerry County Council. I value the experience they bring to the water service because I worked with many of them going back in time. I understand the value they add to the water network system.	spk_166
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-06-17	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_29	I thank the Tánaiste for his reply. It is very clear that Irish Water is underfunded and the pipes need to be replaced and updated. It is costing a bomb to keep repairing the breaks that are going on. The break in Farranfore costs, I believe, €35,000 each time it happens. That is a massive sum of money. I will also highlight that people in other rural areas of Kerry, such as east Kerry, Scartaglin, Castleisland, Lyracrumpane and Fieries, cannot afford to pay for group water schemes. The user cost is approximately €8,000 or €10,000 per house but, lo and behold, because Irish Water is stranded for money, it is looking for €2,000 more from each house on top of the group water scheme cost that Kerry County Council charges. This is not fair; it is double charging. People cannot afford it. They have to drop their request or application for a group water scheme because of this additional cost Irish Water has recently demanded of them. It has stopped five, six or seven group water schemes going ahead.	spk_168

That is wrong. The Planning Regulator is dezoning land. I believe we should zone more land around towns and villages or, otherwise, not zone any land but let every planning application go through on its merits, whether that is through the local authority or An Bord Pleanála. Dezoning land is giving a monopoly to the developer.When the developer has that, the price will be more expensive for the couple trying to buy a house. I am not in favour of CPOs. Kerry County Council has not been able to buy land for over 20 years and all its plots of land are gone or built on. Instead, it is getting money from the Department to buy built houses and that is actually competing with young couples who are trying to buy houses. The local authority has 165 voids and it does not have enough money to bring them back to the standard which is being demanded. As to the cost of materials, we know what is happening with timber as we cannot cut a stick. Small builders have to carry the full cost of building houses because there are no stage payments. Between them, levies and regulations are detrimental to progression.	spk_35

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-06-16	dail	33	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_22	The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, does not have a monopoly on the environment. Farmers have adapted a lot of new and valuable methods, be it for spreading slurry, storing slurry, spreading under the nitrates directive or spreading less fertiliser. They have been doing their best at a great cost. They were told to increase their herds by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, seven or eight years ago. Now they are being told they must reduce their herd by 51%. That is not fair or right. It must be remembered that climate change can occur for many reasons. One reason is that the sun comes closer to the earth at different times when they rotate.This has happened several times and it creates an increase in climate change. We are now told data centres will use 30% of our electricity by 2027 or 2028. There was no just transition when Bord na Móna was closed down. I cannot see how anyone could be proud of this. It was supported by the other Government parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. To think they allowed Bord na Móna to be closed down. At the present time, in case the Minister does not know, timber is being drawn from south Kerry to Roscommon to keep some power plant there going because it cannot get turf. If we did not keep that power plant going, some parts of the country or many parts of it would be without electricity. I support alternative energy and many people do. However, the wind is not reliable and we cannot ensure continuity of power from the wind when it does not blow, nor can we store the wind when we have too much of it. We have to be fair and the Bill is not fair. Farmers are being given no chance to measure the carbon they are sequestering. It is said it will take seven years but, at the same time, the Minister is putting this pressure on them and it is very unfair. Rural Ireland is doing all the harm and there is no word about urban Dublin. The Minister was proud that he was getting a carbon tax to put new buses on the road. Where are they? They are in Dublin. If we look out the gate of the Dáil any day, and I was there for a few minutes the other day, several big double-deck buses pass with one or two people in them. They are passing each other up and they are passing each other down. There are three or four of them behind each other. Why does the Minister not suggest pedestrianising Dublin to take some of the pressure out of the city? If we are speaking about carbon, this is where the carbon is. It is not on the top of Moll's Gap. It is not in Ballinskelligs or in The Pocket in Glenmore or below in the Black Valley. I can tell the Minister there are no fumes there. Dublin has public transport and we do not have it. People cannot move around without cars or vehicles. We need lorries to bring produce into our county from places such as Dublin. We need transport but the Minister will charge us carbon tax. At the same time, most of the carbon is being created in Dublin. The Minister does not mind this because it is his constituency and he does not give one damn about rural Ireland, rural Kerry or anywhere else. People come from all over the world to see the greenery in Kerry. We have more greenery in Kerry than any part of Dublin city. People come to see it but we are not getting credit for it.	spk_372

This Bill will hurt the people who get up early in the morning who must go to work. It will hurt hardest the people who create jobs and employ people. It will hurt farmers and there is no recognition of what farmers can do with carbon sequestration. In France, farmers are allowed to sell gas that is created from animals, which provides income for the farmers. The Government does not want to mention that. The Government seems to want to ensure older people will perish with the cold if they are not allowed to cut turf and must get briquettes from Germany. Many of these people do not have the wherewithal to insulate their homes or install underfloor heating. They do not have the funding for it. The Minister does not want us to build roads and prefers public transport. All the public transport is in Dublin, with buses running around empty or with one or two people inside. At the same time we cannot get any public transport down the country. The Minister has said we can get along with one or two cars for each village. Perhaps we could park it in the churchyard or somewhere. That is totally unrealistic. The Minister is condescending and looking down on the rural people. He has suggested that reintroducing wolves would be good for us. Cop on, man. The Taoiseach and Tánaiste should cop on, along with the rest of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties.

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-06-16	dail	33	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_22	My first point will be on economics. I honestly believe that if the Bill is implemented in full, it will break the country. The Government's suggestion is that everything will have to run on electricity, but it has closed down power stations. We have had three or four close calls since Christmas, including as recently as a couple of weeks ago. We do not have the facilities or ability to generate enough electricity. Take the data centres as an example. We have been told that they are using 8% of all electricity and that in seven years' time, they will be using more than 30%. The cost of electricity will increase and people will not be able to afford it. It has already increased, yet there has been little mention of it. The cost of everything has increased. The cost of electricity will certainly increase because it will cost more to generate and transmit it. The Government will have to consider using gas. It has ruled out the Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, project, but we need gas in the interim because the wind does not blow all the time and energy derived from wind turbines cannot be stored. No less than anyone else, I appreciate alternative energy. We should be pursuing it, but we are not and there is no mention of doing so in terms of solar farms or energy derived from our rivers. We cannot even smell near a river. We cannot clean out a river to help to prevent people from being flooded. Doing so would be a crime. The trouble is that there is no proper recognition of the detrimental effect that the Bill will have on the economy. There must be room for gas to keep the lights lit.Methane gas from cows can be used to our benefit by providing gas which can be added to the grid. The Minister will have to surrender his ideals that everything must be electric. Let us talk about electric cars. We do not have enough points to charge cars. In time, when things improve, electric cars may be fine, but at present they are not. It is not a sustainable idea for people to buy an electric car if they drive to Dublin or drive long journeys to work. If they have the windscreen wipers and lights turned on - people driving to work must have their lights on while driving in the morning and the evening - that brings more pressure. Electric cars are not an option at present. That is the honest humble truth and the Minister will have to wake up to that. People are being told to get rid of petrol and diesel cars. People do not know what to do at present, so they are not buying any car. Those in the motor industry will tell the Government that. People are getting one story from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil that they should be using electric cars, but at the same time they know they are not reliable enough, until they are. It is like the cutting of the turf. The Minister and the Government, it seems to me, are hell-bent on stopping rural people from cutting turf, like they did with Bord na Móna. That will happen in time when the present generation is no longer able to cut it and the younger generation may not be interested in doing so. That will happen in time, but the Government, in this Bill, is putting deadlines on the people, which I believe is wrong. The Government signed up to the Paris Agreement. I believe I was the only Deputy who, in late 2016 or 2017, voted against the deadline because it will be very unfair and unviable. It is going to hurt the working man, the farmer and rural Ireland more so than the urban population. I appeal to the backbenchers in the Government parties to consider that what is happening here is too quick and will affect ordinary working people, the working class, like nothing else has before. I am so concerned about it. There were many people up in Dublin today - farmers from Kerry, poor people - and they said to me it is hard enough to carry on without having to come up to Dublin to drive home their point to the Government. The Government must realise that those people have many other things they should have been working on today, because fine days are scarce in Kerry. You talk about the climate, but it is a different climate, a different world, once you pass Macroom or Mallow. It is a different world altogether. You would know about the climate if you were trying to survive where we are from. We can only get a couple of days.	spk_507

This is an important matter. The protestors today were an orderly and large crowd, but the anguish on their faces said it all. This afternoon, the Taoiseach asked why people did not go after quarries or other entities, but the Government should give them 100% because they do not have the wherewithal to take anyone to court to get redress. If the Government believes that someone is escaping the net but should be playing a role, let it go after him or her. In the first instance, though, it must give the affected people 100%. Giving 90% was only codding them. They would end up paying 40% or 50% because of a loophole. It was suggested that they should get an engineer's report. We deal with engineers every day of the week and we know what they charge. They would have to charge a hefty bill. The people affected by this issue do not have that kind of money. The Minister of State must realise that. When anything happens in Dublin, the Government sees to it right away. There was one shower of rain here a few years back and the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, put on his wellingtons, went out and sorted out the situation, but a flood could be flowing in through our front door and out through the back door and no one would look at us. We would have to fight flat on our backs to get flood relief for Glenflesk or anywhere else or to be allowed to cut a few bushes, which the Government would not let us do. I appeal to the Minister of State now. We all heard the songs of Bridie Gallagher in Jackie Healy-Rae's Bar in Kilgarvan 30 or 40 years ago. She sang eloquently about the homes of Donegal. It is a fright to God if we are going to let the homes of Donegal fall down on the ground around people now. We have to play our part, as must the Government.	spk_191

Like other Deputies, I have been constantly queried about this and asked when the restrictions will be lifted. Other Deputies have criticised the senior Minister for leaving the Chamber but I have the utmost faith in the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. I have every confidence that she will deal with this and respect our wishes. She, as much as anyone and more than some, values the birth of a child. I know that her views on this are the same as my own. The birth of a child is a joy and a pleasure for the mother and father and the wider family. It is very important for the future of our country that babies are born and are looked after properly. I am calling on the Government to ensure that these restrictions are lifted sooner rather than later. It is very important that the partner is there and that they start off together, being together for everything that concerns the baby coming into the world. Why are some hospitals complying with the Minister's direction and allowing partners to attend? It is good that husbands and partners want to be with mothers. It makes for a good start when they start out together. I am calling on the Government to do everything possible to reopen hospitals and allow partners to attend. Finally, it is very sad to see so many babies being lost through abortion. I call on the Department, the Minister for Health and the Government to ensure that advice is given to expectant mothers who are considering abortion that will help them to keep their babies and bring them into the world. The babies in the country are our future.	spk_61

We must ask why Ireland has been given a much lower level of funding than other EU countries. Many small businesses have been closed for a very long time. They will reopen but the trouble is whether they will be able to stay open. That is why the wage subsidy scheme is so important. I ask the Minister of State to ensure this is kept in place for as long as businesses need it to get back on their feet. Where there is stable employment, workers should be encouraged to return to work. The airports at Shannon and Cork are vital to the economy of Kerry. I ask the Minister of State to forget about the third terminal in Dublin. It is vital that the VAT rate is left at 9%. I am amazed and amused by Deputy Griffin, who is calling for the rate to be maintained at 9%. I remind him that it was he and Shane Ross who increased it from 9% to 13.5% in the first place. This was some of the damage they did to rural Ireland and the tourism industry. They also caused hurt to young drivers with the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018, under which they cannot drive on their own to their work or apprenticeship on a provisional licence. They also denied a lot of people a couple of pints in pubs across rural Ireland. That is what they did. I will be watching him in the back. He is now making a big play of calling to keep the rate down but it was he and Shane Ross who increased it during the term of the last Government.	spk_269

Regardless of whatever else you had in life, if you did not have your word you had nothing. The Minister and the Government told us when they extended these powers the previous time that they would not look to extend them further. When they got these draconian, extreme, exceptional powers, it was for an exceptional reason at the time, but there is not an exceptional reason now because we have the vaccine and the vaccine is dealing with the matter. To give credit where it is due, the Government is rolling out the vaccine, but it does not have the science or, at least, has given no concrete reason the powers should be extended or that it should be given control to continue to oppress the people and lock them down. This lockdown has caused severe stress to people with cancer because their treatment has been delayed. This is causing mental illness and isolation. People are gone mad and it has hurt young people and tied them down. It has also affected elderly people, who do not have time on their side. They missed visits from their daughters and sons throughout the lockdowns. They did not see their grandchildren in all that time. One month or one year to a man or woman of 80 years of age is an awful long time when they consider that the clock is against them and they do not have much time left. Where was the science for keeping people out of churches, as was mentioned, and preventing them from going in when the funeral of their grandmother, father or mother was being held in the church because only ten people were allowed in? In the cathedral in Killarney or the church in Castleisland, the ceilings are four storeys high, there is plenty of space and the doors can be opened. It is as if the Government is against religion. I believe that many members of the Government are against religion of all creeds and description. They think they are gods themselves and they do not believe in any other god. I cannot see the reason for this extension or for giving the Government control and power to lock down the people any further. Some people could not travel to their local town because it is outside their county. Take the people of Duagh or Moyvane, who could not go to Abbeyfeale. They had to go farther away, to Caslteisland or Tralee, because they could not go beyond their county boundary. Those rules did not make sense. What is the Government doing asking Deputies to vote for this again? It is absolutely unfair on people in rural Ireland. The Government has stated that people can go into an hotel and have a meal and a drink but they cannot go into the restaurant or pub next door. We were told we would have an outdoor summer, and then when the young congregate after their year in college or whatever, having been told to go out, now they are criticised and castigated. Dr. Tony Holohan said he was shocked and the Taoiseach said he was amazed, and now we are hearing that open spaces are going to be cordoned off and the people are going to be blocked out of them. Dr. Holohan will draw me and the people, even though they are quiet people, to outside the doors of the convention centre. I appeal to the Government to listen to Deputies who deal with the people. Like other Deputies, I have received hundreds of emails and phone calls asking me not to vote to extend the Government's powers to lock down the country for another three months. After that, they might be extended again to February. It could be a further six or seven months, therefore, of the Government wanting to keep control. The Minister should direct his efforts to the people on the waiting lists for cancer treatment, and the Government at large should do something about the young people who want to get on the road, get their provisional licences or be allowed to drive a tractor to help their fathers and mothers in rural Kerry. It should do something about that and look after the young people because it is not doing that. It just wants to keep control and keep a rein on the young and the elderly. It has frightened the country and many people are in trouble with their mental health because they have been isolated for so long. It could take an awful long time to get the country back to where it was, but if the Government extends the powers further and keeps the people under lockdown for another six or seven months, the country may never recover. I ask the Government to be sensible and to have some common sense because nobody can tell me how it makes sense, because of science or anything else, to tell people they can have a pint and a meal in an hotel but they cannot do so in a pub or a restaurant. What is wrong with the Government? Whom does it think it is codding or trying to cod? All of us will have to face people at their doors at the next election, but I would not face them if I was going on with the carry-on the Government is going on with. I apologise for going on but I am very cross. I will not support any further lockdown, but if the need arises, the Government can come back to the House any day and we will support it, even though I did not support the Bill's passage on Second Stage. Even if it is during our summer holidays, I will not mind coming back to the House. I am here to represent the people who elected me and those who did not vote for me. The doors will not be locked. We can come back here any time and debate the matter further if there is a need for a lockdown, but right now there is not and we have vaccines to deal with the virus. The Government is wrong, wrong, wrong, and it is worse it is getting.	spk_313

I thank the Minister, Deputy Coveney; the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne; and the Government for being proactive in this regard. This was a terrible thing that happened to a Ryanair plane. It was forced to land. It reminds us of James Bond but there is a more serious aspect to this when we see what they did in the open skies to a plane that was not theirs and there were civilians on board. What are they doing to their own people in their own land? That is what we are hearing. I am worried about sanctions. That Government or dictatorship has to be sanctioned and it has to be rooted out. The global community must get together and root these fellows out of office, make it difficult for them and get them out of power. We are all calling on the EU, the UN, the United States and everyone. We must join together to ensure that this dictatorship is got out of office. We should get him out of power and restore an elected government in that country for the people who live there.

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-06-01	dail	33	Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_19	I am grateful to Sinn Féin for bringing forward this very important Bill. All of us have spoken so many times before about the insurance industry and the unfairness that is going on. Those who drive taxis, buses, and commercial lorries are all penalised, as are businesses such as publicans and young people who have done nothing wrong. They deserve to get a chance, but they honestly do not. They have not been getting a chance and I am afraid they will not get a chance. When elderly people and young people have cars that exceed ten years of age the insurance companies invariably tell them they cannot be insured. They will not insure them even though they have a valid NCT or MOT. What is missing out of the frame is that the insurance companies have a monopoly. Whatever they say about Mr. Quinn, we were able to pay for insurance when he was there, but now whatever they get is not enough. The big worry for many people and businesses is that they will not even get a quote for next year. That is very wrong. They are people who are employing others and who have done very little wrong. I see what insurance companies are doing. They are paying out and not contesting claims at all. One insurance company told me it would have to give money to a man because he was a customer of the company's as well. He did not deserve money. That is the truth of it. He did not deserve what he got, but someone had to pay a dear claim and it put up his insurance because of the actions of the insurance companies. It is very evident to me that the insurance companies and the banks are destroying young people. They are not giving them a chance to either put a roof over their heads or to put a car on the road. Young people are entitled to get a chance to go on the road and if they blot their copybook, then peg the book at them but give them a chance to go on the road, which they are not getting.	spk_225
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-05-26	dail	33	Independent Beef Regulator: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	I am sharing time with Deputy Michael Healy-Rae. I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on behalf of the people I represent, namely, the small rural farmers throughout County Kerry, from Poulgorm Bridge through Kilgarvan, Kenmare and Sneem to Valencia Island. They are basically suckler farmers supplying top quality calves to beef finishers and fatteners around the country. The best of calves leave Kenmare, Cahirciveen and the marts in Castleisland, Listowel and Tralee for beef finishers in the rest of the country. These suckler farmers play a key role. They work very hard and produce top quality calves. They stay up all night when cows are calving and theirs is an onerous job. They have the breeding of animals down to a fine art.  Our 70,000 beef farmers are continuously being put under pressure by the factories when they decide to reduce the prices. These farmers are the backbone not only of rural areas but the whole of Ireland. More than 10,000 are involved in the processing industry, which is worth more than €2.5 billion to the economy. The factories are blackguarding the beef producers and finishers. With regard to the four-movement rule and the 30-month rule, as I asked the previous Taoiseach, when an animal is hanging up in a factory who will say it is 31 months old or moved through farms five or seven times? These are ridiculous rules but I know what they are about. Their purpose is to give the factories the data so they know when the animals will be coming to them. They then have animals to match out of their own feedlots and they can bring down the price the farmer should get. This is what they are doing and it is controlling the prices. I appreciate that the Minister of State said he is a farmer’s son. I am also a farmer’s son and a farmer, having been farming all my life. I understand what people have to go through day and night. When we overcome everything else we still have to contend with the weather, as we are doing currently. Fertiliser, feedstuff and diesel costs have gone though the roof, but we will not see prices in factories matching that. I remind the Minister of State that prices have gone down in recent days.  We are calling for a beef regulator to be established to ensure farmers are properly paid. A beef regulator could also find out what is happening with the retailers. The retailers are saying they never sought a four-movement rule. It is of no benefit to them and nor is the 30-month rule. I appeal to the Minister to get rid of those two rules. The factories have no divine right or authority from anybody to do this. I ask the Government to remove those two rules. Farmers have gone through too much.  We need to give greater care and protection to producers and consumers to ensure our emerging international trading environment continues into the horizon. Farmers are under threat from Mercosur and from New Zealand and Australian exports. We hear the English are doing a deal with the Australians. We are supplying the greater part of our beef production to the UK. If we lose that market, farmers will be put under more pressure by the factories. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure we open up new markets for live cattle exports, notwithstanding what the Green Party has been saying. Farmers are being victimised and treated like eco-criminals. The Tánaiste is supporting a vegan diet. Everything is down on the farmer. I appeal to the Government to take a stand and show whether it is standing with beef farmers and small farmers in rural Ireland.	spk_29
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-05-26	dail	33	Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2021 [Seanad]: Second Stage	dbsect_13	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. When these powers were first brought in there was a need for exceptional emergency powers, but we do not need them now. We have vaccines and the vaccine roll-out is going well. It was going so well in Killarney that it has been paused for three days until Friday. It is going well on our side of the country, except that we are bringing people from Cork and Waterford to Killarney and people from Rathmore, Gneeveguilla and east Kerry are going up to Limerick, which does not make sense. I am asking for that matter to be rectified because people from Waterford came to Killarney again on Monday, even though I raised the issue with the Taoiseach last week. Instead of extending these powers, I ask the Minister to focus his attention on the mental and physical health of people all over the country. With regard to mental health, the curtailing of civil liberties, for which our people gave their lives and their blood more than 100 years ago, has gone on for long enough now. The vaccine is dealing with the virus and hopefully will get the better of it. On physical health, patients have had cancer treatment impeded, held up and held off. People are very worried because if cancer treatment is not carried out when it should be carried out, hours can perhaps be the difference between a person staying alive and not staying alive. I ask the Minister for Health to focus his attention on that. The Minister said that pubs and restaurants can resume outdoor dining and hotels can resume indoor dining. I am not upset at the hotels being able to have their customers inside, but I am upset for the ordinary punters who are told they must eat and drink outside in this inclement weather. Maybe the Minister will tell us that he will sort out the weather also. In the Six Counties people can eat and drink inside bars and restaurants. Ordinary people just want to have a pint or a meal in their local bar or restaurant. If the Minister insists that it is only hotels that can accommodate this, people from all around rural County Kerry will go into the towns of Kenmare and Killarney just to get in from the rain and into hotels to have a pint. Spreading the crowd around like this is not on at all. The Minister must trust the people and advise them. Holding on to the restrictions until next November, or maybe even February, is not good enough. I have a question on NPHET. Dr. Tony Holohan is advising against antigen testing. Is another member of NPHET involved in testing? Does that member have a testing enterprise or is he involved in a company that produces test kits, which are in competition with antigen testing? I have asked this question of the Taoiseach a couple of times before and he told me there was no such member of NPHET. I have been told there is. It is very unfair that pubs and restaurants will not know the details of the restrictions until the very last minute. The Minister said he will tell us on Friday, but I am afraid he will not even do it then, although he knows the details. It is wrong to assume that publicans can bring in beer and restaurants can bring in food at very short notice. It is not like that. They must get staff, prepare and buy stock. The Minister must give them a proper chance. I cannot vote for the extension of these exceptional powers. The exceptional need that was there when these measures were first brought in is not there now. 	spk_179

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-05-19	dail	33	Water and Wastewater Treatment Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_9	I thank the Regional Group and Deputy Naughten for giving us the opportunity to speak about this very important matter. At the outset I will contradict a comment made by Deputy Bríd Smith to the effect that smelly water is running down the streets of Cahersiveen. She can look after her constituency and I will look after the people of Cahersiveen. Irish Water is only obliged to keep current schemes up to standard and nothing compels it to build new schemes. Irish Water has said it does not have the money to do it. We were promised a scheme for Kilcummin and after 22 years we will get part of it. There is no scheme in Currow, Scartaglen, Caherdaniel, Beaufort or Cromane. Several schemes must be extended and improved, including Castleisland, Brosna, Kenmare and Fenit. Commercial and housing developments are all held up because of a lack of proper infrastructure. Water is a basic human right in a civilised world. People who want to get water through a group scheme can end up paying anything up to €13,000 and that is after getting the grant. There is a scheme in east Kerry and each house in it must pay €10,692 to Kerry County Council. Lo and behold, Irish Water is now looking for €2,262 on top of that. We are talking about water but this is what the people must pay in a group water scheme. There are five schemes in mid Kerry, east Kerry, north Kerry and even south Kerry. They are all over the county. We must look at how these people are being charged on the double because it is not fair. There are antiquated water systems in other places, with pipes breaking day after day. If not for Mr. Freddie Bartlett and his team working day and night to restore water in these places, there would be no water in mid Kerry in places like the board of works road, Pallas and Faha. We welcome that 1.2 km of pipework will be replaced on the board of works road but another kilometre must be done and we must get funding for that. These are very serious matters and I ask the Minister to take this to the Cabinet to ensure infrastructure in Kerry is brought up to standard. The people in Kerry are entitled to good clean water from an uninterrupted source the very same way as the people in Dublin 4 are.	spk_54

At least we will have a cap of three years on the family farm, as there is on all residential properties. I am still not happy with this because I believe the land should not be assessed. It should be the family home, the same as everybody else. Why treat farmers, publicans and shopkeepers differently from everyone else? Why should their business places be assessed? I will give an example. A poor farm could be valued at €500,000. To pay 7.5% of that would amount to €37,500 a year, for three years. That would be €112,500 the young fellow or whoever takes on the farm will be responsible for paying back. If that young fellow had to provide a house for himself, with a mortgage, and to pay back this loan, he would not get much out of the work of 60 or 70 cows and he would be fairly run down to the ground before he would be paid back. It is not right. The family farm should not be assessed in the first place. Even though farms may be worth big money, they do not always generate big money. That is what we have to know here. The Minister of State said that family members must have been involved in the enterprise for five years previously and that they must farm the farm for six years in future. That is a fair commitment. What we are not recognising properly is that farmers have a constant battle on their hands, long hours of manual work, red tape and regulations. When they have dealt with everything else, they have to contend with the weather. Many finish up in bad shape physically and maybe mentally too. That needs to be recognised. To say that some young fellow or his wife must continue to farm does not consider that they have children who may be going to school or that there may be apprentices. It is wrong to stop the farmer who is left behind from leasing the land, because that would generate money for him or her. Every one of us here has a duty to ensure that every law that is brought in is democratic. This assessment of the family farm is not democratic. The family farm is handed down and the farmer wants to hand it down again to the next generation. That has been done traditionally in Ireland.I respect the Minister of State very much because she keeps people in mind at all times. However, she needs to consider this again. The family farm should not form part of the assessment. It is not fair, it is not right and it is not democratic. In the normal case, income and savings are assessed and the first €35,000 of savings are not reckonable. In many cases, farmers do not have €35,000 in savings because, as has been said here, many of them do not even make €20,000 a year. It is very wrong to say that the person left behind when, all of a sudden, the worker on the farm finishes up in a hospital and then in a nursing home cannot rent out the farm. It is very wrong to include it in the assessment in the first place.	spk_250

It was very wrong to give these funds that name. It is such a lovely bird that comes to our shores every year. It is grand to be listening to the ding-dong about housing that has been going on here over the last four or five years. It is clear that the Government needs to tackle the investment funds and try to level the playing pitch. It was very wrong to see young couples competing against these massive investment funds to try to put a roof over their own heads, only to be blown out of it by these funds which are being incentivised by the Government. That incentivisation must stop.  There are other things we need to do to help young couples in Kerry and in every other county up and down the country. We have a regulator going around rezoning land now in all our counties. The regulator is even dezoning serviced land. We have another scenario where it finishes up with only one square of land zoned and that developer then has a monopoly and can charge whatever he or she wants to charge. We need to zone enough land and let there be competition or else forget about zoning and let every planning application stand on its own when it is submitted to the local authority, Kerry County Council, Cork County Council or wherever. However, it is wrong to give any developer or investment company a monopoly. I have nothing against developers because if it were not for developers and builders, we would have no houses.  There are also designations, like urban-generated housing, to stop people building outside towns. That is actually hurting the people outside the towns in the first place. People who do not own land and want to buy a site are stopped from buying a site, the same as the people coming out and denying them the chance of building in their own area. It is very wrong. Places are not serviced. People need to start on the ground with sewerage schemes and water schemes. Our infrastructure is falling asunder. Different things are happening at present.

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-05-18	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I raise with the Taoiseach the issue of the building of a sewerage scheme in Kilcummin, east Kerry, north of and bounding Killarney. The people in Kilcummin have been trying to progress this scheme since 2000. Work was to begin around 2006 or 2007 but the contractor was found not to be able to deliver. Thus, Kerry County Council decided to tender it out again and a new form of tender was demanded by the Department. Kerry County Council was unsure, the contractors were unsure and, anyway, the Department of Finance stopped it and withdrew the scheme in 2008 because the country was gone bust, as the Taoiseach knows well. Promises were being made continuously, year after year, to deliver this scheme. There was money available to upgrade the road, but the road up to Kilcummin could not be resurfaced because it was anticipated the sewerage scheme would be coming down any week or any month. As it was supposed to happen very soon, the road resurfacing kept being deferred until last year, when, for the first time, the truth was told that the scheme would not go ahead in 2020, even though it was promised. To go back to 2013, the Government of the time, including Labour, promised €1.2 million for that scheme. Promises were again made in early 2019 but I have told the Taoiseach what happened in 2020. Lo and behold, Irish Water announced last Thursday that the scheme would go ahead in late 2022, with tenders going out at that time but the sting was in the detail because three roads, involving almost 40 houses, are to be cut out of the scheme. The reason Irish Water gave was that these people did not apply for the scheme. Nothing could be further from the truth as they were never asked to apply. It gave another reason, that costs have increased, which is the truth. There is no point in it trying to blame the people. The Taoiseach is here in his bubble every day, talking about building houses with one policy or another, and he is saying that funding is not a problem, and telling people to build in villages or towns, and not to build one-off houses out the country. The planning regulators are putting every obstacle in their way. Kilcummin is the largest parish in the country, with all streams and rivers from this area going into the lakes of Killarney. There are two nursing homes and 210 houses being accommodated, leaving out 40 houses. There are several villages in Kerry without sewerage schemes - Kilcummin, Currow, Scartaglin, Castleisland and Beaufort. Several schemes need to be extended or brought up to standard at Castleisland, Brosna, Kenmare and Fenit.Commercial or housing developments are being halted because of these inferior schemes. 	spk_48

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-05-18	dail	33	Affordable Housing: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_14	I thank Sinn Féin for allowing us this time to debate this very important motion. I have nothing personal to say to anyone, but there is a hames being made of the building of houses. The Government is paying a regulator to dezone land in Kerry. It is paying a regulator to block one-off houses for people who would build the houses themselves if they could get the planning permission. The Government is giving one developer in each settlement, town or village the monopoly to build houses. If there were a developer on a site on each side of a town, at least you would have competition, but what happens if you give that monopoly to one developer? Those developers have a monopoly and can charge what they like. There is no competition. Small traditional builders who always built a few houses and sold them on cannot build now because they cannot finance a scheme of ten or 12 houses. Banks will not put forward the finance. Since the abolition of stage payments, they cannot carry the full cost of the houses until they get paid. What happened - and I have seen this happening - when they finished the houses and sold them on? Money was held back by the purchasers and the developers found it very hard to get the last €15,000 or €20,000 from them. That is why the builders are not building. Following the debacle we have gone through here day after day when we have raised the felling licences, the price of timber has gone up to an exorbitant amount and is not available. It takes six weeks to deliver the timber ordered for a house. They will not tell you the price, or they cannot do so until they bring it to you. Irish Water is charging €6,500 per house in a scheme. The price of insulation has gone up by 40%. The price of steel has doubled. There are other levies and regulations. If the Government is wondering why it is costing massive sums of money to build houses or why it is so hard to build them, those are some of the reasons. The Government would want to cop on and go down the country and look at what is going on there. The Government is talking about €450,000 for a house. That is not an affordable house.	spk_295

He has done his utmost, his very best, during the past 12 months to highlight their case. Those Debenhams workers have been through the mill and, as was said, they were peaceful and honourable in their protest and all they sought was their rights, to be paid their own money. It is galling to think that this company, which has all those assets and has been selling them and moving them from one place to another, has not been brought to book for it. It just shows there is a law in the country for some but not for others. I understand the company will now operate online and it has got to keep all the goods it had. That is very unfair and unjust on those workers. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement had and has a role to play in situations like this. We had other liquidations in County Kerry where small private employers of small and medium enterprises were caught out by bigger companies and those companies are back in action again, having left many people, including myself, without the money we earned and for which we work hard. They are in competition again and working away as good as ever. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has a lot to answer. That office should be seen to be doing its job, which I do not believe it has in many instances.	spk_45

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-05-12	dail	33	Private Security Services (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_19	I am very concerned about certain sections of this Bill. Evicting people and families from their homes is wrong and should be avoided in every way possible. As Deputy Michael Collins said, sometimes it is done early in the morning or late at night. That is very unfair and can have an unsettling effect on families for the rest of their lives if it happens to them when they are young children. I am concerned about the suggestion that private security firms would be allowed carry out these operations and I will not be voting for that in any way or fashion. It is totally wrong. We know what happened in cases where these people came down with their faces covered, frightened the living daylights out of people and put them out of their homes. Any suggestion of allowing that to happen would be wrong. I have faith in the sheriff in our county because people can talk to the man and he will see reason. He understands how people get into difficulties and he does everything he can to facilitate them and ensure an eviction is avoided. We should have people like that dealing with these cases. On the other hand are the security firms that only want to get people out of their homes as quickly as possible. They demand their fee and have no feelings or consideration at all for a family or how they got into trouble. I have called previously for a system whereby, when a family is in trouble and cannot pay back the money for their home, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, together with the local authority, would buy that house and rent it back to the family in the same way a local authority house would be rented. In time, the family might get on their feet again and go into the tenant purchase scheme. One of the gripes I have with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is that the tenant purchase scheme has been all but abolished. That was a great scheme, where tenants could buy out the house when they got on their feet. In some cases with rural cottages, a farmer's son might have given over a site to a local authority to build the house and after a number of years, in nearly all such cases the house would be bought out under the tenant purchase scheme. Any house that has been built since 2015 is not allowed to be purchased by any tenant. Those are the rules in our local authority anyway. It is totally and absolutely wrong. I am calling on the Government to address this issue and ensure that decision is reversed. Regarding vulture funds, it is my solid contention that the banks and lending institutions with which the homeowners dealt should not have handed their loan books over to the vulture funds or should not have been allowed to do so. It was not with them that the individuals dealt. They dealt with the manager of a bank or a lending institution of local, Irish origin. Our banks are not helping people very much, even though the State is involved and has large shareholdings in each of them. It is totally and absolutely wrong to think that a bank can hand over its loan book to vulture funds that do not care, except to scalp people and put them out on the road. That is wrong and the Government should be addressing it. As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, the new thing is farms being sold before farmers know they are for sale at all. That is totally wrong and everyone knows that. There will be more farms for sale because in 2013 the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, told people to double milk production because milk was the new white gold and the Chinese were going to like it and were going to drink a lot of it. Now we hear they do not care for it and farmers are being told they must downsize their herds. The 	spk_266

It is important at this time as the country begins to open up for many operators that have been severely hit, including SMEs, tour operators in Kerry, hoteliers, restaurateurs and publicans. I have to pass a yard in Killarney when taking the Killarney bypass every day where over 90 buses have been parked without moving for almost a year and half. It is terrible. These people will need financial support to get off the ground and get going again. They created massive employment and were providing a massive service. They knew every aspect of their trade and had become masters of it but they have been closed for a long time now. The small supports that were given in the meantime were nothing like what they were used to operating with. When businesses finally open their doors it will not be the same as it was. It is important to remember that. Many of them will need financial support and cheap loans to ensure they get off the ground. Loans should be meted out directly to operators that require them because if people have to comply with the banks' requirements, it will never happen. People are losing confidence in the banks by the day because regional banks no longer have a face to them. People do not seem to know who the manager is and the manager does not have a say. The request for a loan goes up to Dublin and some faceless person decides not to give the loan in most cases. I am calling for speedy assessment of loan applications because time matters greatly. People cannot wait. No credit is available anywhere any more, except maybe for a few days or two or three weeks. Gone is the day when people would pay at the end of the year and the farmer would come down and pay the shopkeeper, miller or whoever at the end of the year or pay the contractor for his work on the last fair day of the year in Kenmare or wherever.This does not happen any more. People can no longer wait for their money. People will go down if they do not get financial support. This is a time such as we never had before. We have been locked down for almost a year and a half and when we will finally open up, it will be different to what we were used to. This is why we welcome this facility and we hope it will be available to SMEs, farmers and tourism operators because Kerry has been practically closed down for the past year. All the lights have been out and the doors locked. I look forward to seeing them opening up and each and every one of them continuing as they were, giving the service they had been giving to our people and the people who visit us from China to Texas and those from all over the world who visit Killarney, Kenmare, Dingle and the Ring of Kerry, and Ballybunnion and Ballyheige in north Kerry. I appeal to the Government to make sure this loan guarantee scheme through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland is made available to all those who need it, and many of those people do.	spk_286
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-05-12	dail	33	Planning and Development, Heritage and Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2021: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_24	I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute on behalf of farmers and landowners throughout County Kerry on this very important issue. We have been hurt by designations before and no proper compensation was given to farmers. I have said previously in Dáil Éireann that it is a terrible thing when a farmer's house is broken into, perhaps when he or she is at mass, and money and possessions taken. Elderly farmers have been beaten in their homes and had their goods and money stolen. Something similar happens when the Government or the EU decides to designate a whole farm and perhaps the adjoining farms. I have nothing against the hen harrier or anything like that, but when farms were designated to protect hen harriers, the farmers in question were robbed in broad daylight. I call it daylight robbery to do that without giving proper compensation. The farmers had to fight and agitate to get some small amount of compensation. To give the Minister of State an idea of what people in rural areas are dealing with, there are places around Brosna where Coillte and other forestry owners planted forestry but, when it came to the next-door neighbour applying to plant, he or she was refused because the land was designated for the hen harrier. It is daylight robbery and it is very unfair. I spoke in the House some days ago about a farm of 365 acres in Kerry that was designated as an SAC. The son of the family wanted to build a house on the farm. Kerry County Council, in its wisdom, said that although the whole 365 acres were designated as an SAC, the young fellow deserved to build a house and it granted him planning permission. His father had died and he wanted to live alongside his mother because she was not able to drive. Lo and behold, An Taisce appealed the council's decision to An Bord Pleanála and the young fellow lost the permission that was granted by Kerry County Council. The council had gone through everything and decided there was no harm in the world, only good, in granting the permission. However, the appeal was approved and the woman finished up on her own, with people having to collect her to take her places and then take her home again. It was not fair or right that she lived out the last few years of her life on her own. I am very worried about these designations. We have been told that more than 30% of the land in the country could be designated as SACs and that the land that was previously designated as SACs could never be touched, farmed in any fashion or have anything else done with it. What kind of robbery is that? It is pure robbery to contemplate doing such a thing. It is being done following agitation by the Green Party and its counterparts in Europe. They are at the back of this, trying to paralyse and finish farmers forever and return farming to what it was after the Ice Age. We have to think of people first. We must think of the small families that keep the light shining in the valley and keep the place alive. If we do not have people, there is no life.

I am asking the Minister of State not to ram designations down farmers' throats, nor do this behind their backs. I am asking that he give the people of Kerry and Ireland the chance to make submissions if maps are being produced and more land is going to be designated as SACs or whatever designation is being put on them. I am asking that people be advised of the implications this will have for planning permission and farming into the future. If the Minister of State does not do that, he is robbing people's livelihoods and their lives from them. He must be fair with them and give them a chance to make submissions. Whether they are single farmers, farming organisations or landowners, people must have a chance to make submissions and they must be informed of what is proposed to be done.

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-05-11	dail	33	Europe Day: Statements	dbsect_11	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this very important matter. There is no doubt in the world but that we have benefited magnificently from Europe over the past 40 to 50 years. However, we are now at a crossroads and we may no longer get as much out of Europe as we would like. We are getting a lot of dictation and directives that are hurting people, including farmers and working-class communities. The climate change directives are pushing our society towards a radically different future that will make many of our citizens in rural Ireland poorer, as well as people right across the country and in the rest of Europe. That is my considered opinion. We are hearing a lot of talk at present about reducing the dairy herd. Deputies in this House have pointed out that Irish farmers produce the best milk in a cleaner and more efficient way than do many of the factory farmers in Europe. Irish farmers feed their cattle on green grass for most of the year and they must be rewarded for that. This State and this Government have not demanded sufficient funds from Europe for basic infrastructure. I am thinking, for instance, of sewerage schemes in rural towns and villages in County Kerry. All of that could be financed out of the EU's emergency pandemic response fund, but Ireland has not looked for that funding.	spk_167
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-05-11	dail	33	Residential Property Market: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_12	I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this very important motion. The Ministers for Finance and Housing, Local Government and Heritage know as well as everyone else that these investment firms are bidding against young couples for single houses and blowing them out of the market. That is wrong. The Ministers are saying they are going to rectify it and I hope they do that because they must. Young couples are facing many real obstacles to put a roof over their heads. First, there is the problem of getting planning permission and zoning. They go through hell and high water to get planning permission. The planning regulator is not being fair and is dezoning land. In one instance a few years ago, Mick O'Connell, the best footballer that ever graced the fields of this country, got Killorglin Town Council to vote to zone a bit of land for him for a small number of houses. The planning regulator did not even know where Valentia Island was but he insisted that Kerry County Council rescind that zoning and Mick O'Connell was stopped in his tracks. There are other issues, for example, the increase in material costs, as well as levies and taxes. We have great local builders like Michael Jack Cronin, who has done great work in recent times. The Government must go back to the traditional way of house building, which was to give the local authorities funds to build houses. The Government is also blocking the tenant purchase scheme and stopping tenants from purchasing their houses, which they did traditionally over the years and there was nothing wrong with that. Any house built since 2015 is not allowed to be bought out. We should go back to that old system. The banks are messing people around.	spk_208

Since lorries and buses can do the theory test online, why can the theory test not be set up online for all vehicles? The Government is supposedly working with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to get the theory test online for more than one year. Why is it taking more than one year to get this off the ground? Traditionally, farmers' sons and daughters could do their theory test when they reached 16 years of age, get their provisional licence and drive a tractor to help out on the farm or get a job locally for the summer. This is not possible now. Young drivers cannot do the theory test, get their provisional licence or get on the road. It is essential for everybody to have a licence in rural Ireland. I am asking the Tánaiste to ask the testers to work on Saturdays and Sundays to deal with the backlog and to ensure the theory test can be applied for online for all learner drivers to get on the road.	spk_84

It is very important that what happened last year - and each and every one of us remembers what happened last September - does not happen this year. The colleges were supposed to open and it was bad foresight by the Government, though I am not blaming any one Minister, that one week after the colleges were supposed to open, it was decided they were not opening at all. Many parents from all around the country had paid for their children's accommodation and the students themselves had helped to pay the costs as well. It was frightening to think, as Deputy Naughten mentioned, that the University of Limerick would not give back the fees to many of its students. That was wrong. It was wrong also of private landlords to hold on to the money when students were not using the accommodation. I sympathise with landlords who were themselves in financial difficulty with the banks and so forth but those who were not should have given the students back their money, as the students were not using the accommodation. It affected students in rural areas more than those in cities. Students in County Kerry must travel to Tralee or to Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dublin. It is a very worrying time for parents who seek to have accommodation in place for their children, to have a safe and proper place for them as for many students, it is their first time away from home. It is a very trying time for parents and students struggling to get going.	spk_33

Each and every one of us knows there is not a man, woman or child who has not been affected by this pandemic whether mentally, financially or in another way. I refer especially to the mental effects. I will highlight one special thing to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the other Minister of State, although Deputy Butler would have an advantage in this regard as she was very good in fighting the abortion Bill which affected unborn babies. The St. John of God group has been operating a very valuable service in St. Mary of the Angels in mid-Kerry, which has been looking after children with mental and physical disabilities since 1965. The property was donated free of charge to the Franciscan Sisters by the Doyle family in 1965. The congregation operated it up until 2005 when it was handed over to the St. John of God group. This group is now giving up saying that, as it was not properly funded by the HSE, it cannot continue. A rumour has gone out, however, that the property will now be sold by the St. John of God group. It would be particularly hurtful to the patients in the centre and their parents if it was to be sold. I ask the Minister of State to ensure it is never sold and that it will be kept by the HSE, or whatever Department or group is put in charge, when the Saint John of God group gives up at the end of the year. There are 64 patients in the centre at present in addition to the trained staff who look after them. I appeal to the Minister of State not to let this property be sold to anyone and for it to be kept for the patients who need care.	spk_21

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-04-21	dail	33	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_30	This Bill, if it is implemented in its current form, will adversely affect every man, woman and child in rural Ireland. Carbon charge increases will affect people going to work and will cost them more. Farmers' incomes will be reduced as they will have to reduce their herds and pay more carbon tax on diesel. Ordinary, honest people will have to pay more to heat their homes, and they are being told they cannot burn turf or timber. They are being told they must insulate their homes and put in heat pumps and air-to-water systems that are very costly. Where will ordinary working people get the money required? It can be up to €40,000 to do these kinds of jobs. I am referring to poor people who are not working and people on small incomes who are struggling as it is. Already, the waiting period for a deep retrofit, for those who qualify, is more than 18 months and can even be two years. We should remember it is only people on the fuel allowance who will qualify for it. The tourism sector, which is vital to Kerry, will be financially burdened by the carbon tax changes and by the implications of the utterances of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who has said air travel charges will have to be increased. This will prevent visitors from coming to Ireland. Although most hauliers are now going along with the new Euro 6 diesel engine, they have to pay more carbon charges. The Minister does not understand this. By 2030, farmers will have to reduce their herds by 51%. I have heard Fianna Fáil Deputies contradicting that and saying we were scaremongering. We are not scaremongering; we are telling the truth, and that is truth about it. Teagasc, formerly ACOT, has advised farmers for the past 40 years to increase their herds. In 2013, the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, told dairy farmers to increase their herds and that milk was the new white gold. He told us the Chinese would drink it. I think they do not like it at all now. Now the Government in which Deputy Coveney is still a Minister is telling us to cut production by more than 50% by 2030.The Minister stated that farmers who do their best to cut down on carbon emissions and have hedges and ground that sequester carbon will be accounted for, but it will take seven years to measure that. In the meantime, notwithstanding that, all the farmers who do not produce any CO2 and those who sequester more CO2 than they produce will, after the Bill is enacted, pay more in carbon tax. Where were the discussions with the farming organisations such as the IFA, Beef Plan Movement and ICMSA? There have been none. While there is an advisory council and there have been meetings of the climate action committee, their memberships are all restricted. The people who know what they are doing were not allowed in, and that is what the Government is at. Farmers have made great strides to improve their farms environmentally over recent years, complying with the nitrates directive and storing and spreading slurry safely and properly, with low emissions, vacuum tankers, trailing shoes, dribble bars and all the rest. The Chinese and other Asians are building more coal-burning power stations to produce electricity. Africa, India, China and other Asian countries can use ordinary, reliable diesel engines in machinery, while we have to use the Euro 6 engine. We have to use AdBlue, which is troublesome. The Chinese are building coal-burning stations and we are closing our turf-burning peat stations in Bord na Móna. In normal times, outside of the pandemic, at any one time there are 7,000 aeroplanes in the sky. Are they going to be operated by electric batteries? Where will they be plugged in in the sky? How long will it take to charge these aeroplanes? The farmer, however, will have to get an electric tractor to spread slurry by 2027. Where are the Fianna Fáil Deputies who said that is not in the Bill? It certainly is. The Government need not try to cod the people because it will not get away with it. There will be nothing for the good tractors that farmers have but to send them to Hammond Lane for scrap. That is where they will end up. After all the efforts of the Minister, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in respect of the Bill, by how much will they reduce the global temperature? What mathematical modules is the Government using? It is scaremongering. This is just another tax. The Minister must know that the global temperature has reduced by less than 1% since 1850. That is a fact. If we all left this country, closed the doors and turned off all the lights, it would reduce global emissions by only 0.13%, and that is a fact. There are new rules for the Order of Business, but since the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is the one involved in the Bill, I ask him where the funding is for the local improvement schemes for rural Ireland and Kerry. Where is the funding to install a proper water supply to operate in mid-Kerry, around Beaufort? It breaks down every day and people have no water. That is essential but the Government is not considering those issues. The Government, headed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, has done enough harm. It closed Bord na Móna - no more moss peat, no briquettes. While it is true we can import them, that costs money and carbon is emitted in doing so. Does the Government realise that? Is it awake or what is wrong with it? We are leaving 10,000 acres of bog behind us in Littleton, County Tipperary. We did not have gold or diamonds to start with and we do not have oil. If we did, we would not be allowed to use it. I return to the suggestion that the Minister of the day will be able to bring forward a carbon budget, whether the House supports it or not. That is undemocratic. There is much talk about Putin at present, but he is nowhere near as bad as this - not a hope in the world. He would not be at the races with the gang we have here. What a stunt, whereby the Minister thinks he can push through a budget without giving the House any say. Will he stand up and tell us that is democratic? It is not, and he will not get away with it. If the Minister, Deputy Ryan, does get away with it for the time being, he will not do so when he next goes to the doors. It is undemocratic, and the men and women of 1916, 1921 and 1922 fought for democracy in this country, and he is trying to shut it down. He will probably try it, given the new voting arrangements and the way that the coalition parties are tied together at the hip. Fianna Fáil, just to stay in power, is backing the Bill and the Minister. Perhaps they will get away with it for the time being, but each and every member of the Government will regret it and get it back on the doors because that is what they deserve for trying to blackguard the people, the ordinary good honest people who are trying hard to survive. The Government is trying to drive them down to the ground but it will not get away with it, and I hope it does not. The Minister might get away with it temporarily but he will have to face the people, and that is democracy. He will get his answer for sure, and I promise him that.	spk_308

When will vaccines be rolled out to elderly and vulnerable people living at home, such as a man in his late 70s in east Kerry who has had a leg amputated, as well as a stroke and several other health complications during his life? Carers are in and out of his home daily to try to keep him alive and at home. He needs the vaccine. When will vaccines be delivered to the people of Kerry who are confined to their homes? Nurses and other people are coming back to work to administer vaccines but they cannot get clarity as to how much they will be paid. We need to pay them properly and look after them. They need clarity as to what they will get. Otherwise, we will be in trouble in regard to rolling out the vaccine.	spk_112

There has been much talk about remote working and of people working from home. What about people who do not have homes or broadband? What about the towns and villages in Kerry? I remind the Government Chief Whip, who orchestrated this event today in order that Fine Gael Deputies could praise the Government, of that fact. What is he going to do about the towns and villages which have either no sewerage schemes or ones that are inadequate and where people cannot build houses as a result? There are about 20 villages and towns, in case Deputy Griffin does not know of them, without sewerage schemes. I am asking the Government to provide the money in this regard. There was a great deal of hullabaloo about the rural work initiative during the week but there is no fear of money being made available for any scheme, town or village in Kerry. I ask him to come out now to tell us where the money is.	spk_211

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-04-01	dail	33	Project Ireland 2040: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_12	The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister of State in attendance, Deputy Ossian Smyth, should note that nothing I have to say about the Government or Project Ireland 2040 is in any way personal. I am glad to have the opportunity to talk about the plan because it is a very serious matter. It will affect many in rural Ireland. It is a laugh to think that we are considering a plan for 20 years when the Government does not actually know what is going to happen in four or three weeks' time. I believe it does not really know what is going to happen next week. That is how it appears to the people, with one Minister contradicting another and one professor in NPHET contradicting another. They all have a different story. It is hard for the people from rural areas or any other part of Ireland to believe what is now being said over the airwaves. The plan is going to hurt people in rural Ireland in a very negative way. It was introduced by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil two or three years ago and now it is being continued by those two parties and the Green Party. This is all about boosting five cities to the detriment of rural towns and villages. Self-employed people, businesspeople, farmers, housewives and everyone who is paying and will have to pay carbon tax will be affected more. The Government wants to stop us cutting turf and eating meat and it wants to close more of the rural pubs and more post offices. It is letting the banks walk out of the towns even though it has a share in them. That is what is happening. The Government has closed the churches to an unnecessary extent, and we all know that. The Government wants to stop granting planning permission in rural areas. It is telling people they should and could work from home but many of them do not have a home. They would have a home if they could get planning permission but they cannot. The planning regulator is now told to direct people to the five cities. That is what we read in the 2040 plan. The Government is hell-bent on following the Green Party line to stay in power. It seems it does not matter if, as a result, it is hurting the people, the grand people of rural Ireland. They have been and are being blackguarded, and if this plan is implemented they will be hurt even more. The plan will hurt them like they were never hurt before. The Government continues with spin. We saw what it did this week with the massive plan for rural towns. There is no penny of money for any project. We are told the money is available. The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, put up a very good show on the television, on the news or whatever, but no matter how she was pressed, there was no penny of money for any project. She still got away with it.Then the Government Chief Whip came to the Chamber this morning and orchestrated a spin of praise for An Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar. He took away most of the slot from ordinary Deputies from throughout the country, while seven or eight Fine Gael Deputies praised the Tánaiste all morning. They are good at blathering, boasting and spinning but they are hurting the people. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, seems to think he is responsible for the environment or that he is the environment, but there is more to the environment than carbon emissions. Sewage treatment plants are needed in several parts of our county. They include Scartaglin, Kilcummin, which has been waiting for 20 years, Curra, Brosna and Beaufort. They say it is possible to get planning permission in these towns but the applicant will have to wait until it is connected to a public treatment plant. I found documents in my shed the other night dating from when my father made representations to build an extension to the sewer in Castleisland, where all the homes are connected to septic tanks. That was 40 years ago. I found the documents in a box in the old shed and that is God's gospel truth. In Brosna, a man sought permission to build four houses but the application was cut down to two. He wanted to knock down two old houses and got permission to replace those two, but he will not get to build the other two until the treatment plant is brought up to scratch. In Kenmare, a developer applied for permission to build 55 houses and the Planning Regulator stated that the density was too low and he would have to add a further 30%, or 20 houses. When he did that, Kerry County Council told him he could not build the houses until the Kenmare treatment plant had been upgraded. A county development plan is being developed for Kerry and the regulator has told us we can zone more land in Killarney but we must keep the same acreage of land throughout the Killarney municipal area. We will have to cut down places such as Gneevgullia and Rathmore, and it will be the same in Tralee and north Kerry. Tralee can be expanded but the people out in the country cannot get planning permission. There are also young people who are not able to get onto a county council housing list or a local authority housing list. They want to build houses for themselves. It is atrociously difficult to get permission but we believe that, because of this 2040 plan, it will become much worse and much more difficult to get permission in rural areas. If land is being zoned in one place, it will have to be dezoned in another place. That is totally unfair. I do not know who the Planning Regulator is or where he is from and I do not believe he knows any part of Kerry. He is going by figures and he does not understand the reality and the issues that people have to contend with there. Dairy farmers are being told they will have to cut their numbers. The Minister's colleague in Cork South-Central, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, told farmers in 2013 that they would have to increase dairy production, that milk was the new white gold and that the Chinese would drink more milk. Now he and the Government are telling us that we must reduce the number of cows in our yards. It is the same with the suckler herd. After fellows broke their backs to increase the numbers to try to live, having been told by Teagasc and the farming organisations to build up their herds, they are now being told to switch off the lights and reduce the numbers. The very same scientist who gave the figures on methane gas 15 years ago and said farmers were destroying the environment has admitted he was 70% wrong. This is what is being done to poor farmers. They get up in the morning and work seven days of the week, 365 days a year, and they are being thrown around like this. The Minister has to understand they are being wronged. Every man and woman on the road will from here on have to pay more in carbon tax, whether that is the young fella with the slats in his nose going to work at 6.30 a.m. or 7 a.m., the housewife taking the children to school, the employer employing people or the businessperson with a van. They will all suffer from carbon tax, all because the Government wants to stay in power and to keep following what the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is telling us to do. He told us in 2007 to buy diesel cars and said they were the answer. While they may be durable, economical cars, now he wants us to get electric cars that have no durability and are not as carbon friendly as he says they are. He has been torn apart on that issue. Electric cars are not reliable or durable and they would not carry somebody as far as Killarney with the windscreen wipers, the radio and the lights turned on at the same time because they all draw energy from the battery. The driver would be stuck on the side of the road with his or her thumb out, asking some fella for a lift.	spk_354

I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh and Sinn Féin for giving us the opportunity. I recognise and appreciate what the men and women in Moore Street did more than 100 years ago to secure our freedom. We are all joined here, regardless of the political party to which we are affiliated or otherwise, to appreciate those people who fought and gave their lives for our freedom. There are places in Kerry where people fought. The people involved included men and women from Cumann na mBan. There were men like Tadhg Coffey and his gallant group who fought at the Countess Bridge in Killarney. There were the men at Ballyseedy. Stephen Fuller was the only one to survive. They were all tied together. Then a bomb was put into the middle of them by the English and they were blown sky-high. Stephen Fuller survived. Then the local flying column took on the English at Headford. But for the train coming sooner than it should have from the fair in Kenmare, they would have done more or sorted out more of the English soldiers that day. However, they did kill eight. Two volunteers, Allman and Bailey, lost their lives after they were shot. Others involved included men like Johnny O'Connor, who became a Deputy, Michael Doherty from Lisnagrave, Tom 'Scarteen' O'Connor from Kenmare, Captain Flynn, Pat Shea and Tommy Mac from Ballymacelligott. I want to thank the local commemoration committee, including Derry Healy, Jimmy Kelly, Seamas Moynihan, Michael Scannell and Tina Healy from Rockfield. Her grandfather was Dan Healy from Rockfield. He was in the fight on that day of 21 March. Tim Horgan and Liz Spillane, a local girl, were involved too. I knew Dan Patsy O'Sullivan from Kilgarvan who was there. He lived to be old and I was glad to have known him while he was alive. I appreciate very much what he and his companions did. There were 39 of them there on that day. They had a major victory. It put the English in their place and put them thinking. They were never the same or as strong after losing that battle at Headford. I really appreciate the freedom that they gave for us in that major fight. Everyone here has to appreciate those people and understand what they went through. There was torture and torment. Some of them were tortured and went through a major ordeal to secure our freedom. I support the Bill. It is important that Moore Street stays the same as it is. We have to remember the people - the men and women - who fought there.	spk_19
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-03-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_3	I wish to ask the Government to open up construction for all those who have not been working for the past four or five months. I wish to ask the Taoiseach respectfully to increase the numbers who can go into a church for a funeral mass. I ask him to take into consideration size and height and capacity of places such as cathedrals and big churches and to increase the numbers.Fr. Gearóid Walsh was on our local radio last week and he said that we have a professor for everything, but no professor or position has been created for a person with common sense. I sympathise and empathise with the McCarthy family from Gneeveguilla, and particularly with Mr. Jack McCarthy who lost his wonderful wife, Mary Theresa, yesterday. There are around 100 members of that family. I do not know how they are going to manage, but I do not envy the person deciding who the ten people to go to the funeral will be. I want to go on to construction. For too long now some construction workers cannot go to work. Those involved in social housing can go to work. It is very galling for some people, when Tim can go to work, but Tom and Mike cannot go to work because they are not working in social housing. Not everyone is able to get on the social housing list and people need houses. Some people want to build their own houses and they should be allowed to finish them. We have to recognise that English recruitment companies are looking for skilled workers of all types, including carpenters, plumbers and drivers. Flannery Plant Hire is advertising every week for 360° excavator drivers and drivers of dumper trucks and different vehicles to work on the HS2 rail project in England, which is the biggest job since the Channel Tunnel. If the Taoiseach does not believe me, he can get the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, while he still has him, to look on Twitter - he is good on Facebook - to check all that is happening in that line. Surely they should work together and see that, and they are looking for women as well in case that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, is listening in to us. You see-----	spk_60

The problem though is we are not getting the figures down and if that is to continue, the Government will have to be sensible and allow sectors of the community to open and to work. The Government must trust people. People working on farm buildings can keep away from each other, as can people working on building a rural one-off house or a small estate. Other groups, such as small traders and shopkeepers, are also under severe pressure from multinational companies trading online. They will never be able to open up if this thing goes too far, and I am afraid that it is. Let us take hairdressers as an example. When they were allowed to open, they were very careful to just allow one person in at a time. We must be sensible and trust people to work. If this continues, I do not know who or what is going to pay for it. Are we going to lose all our workers to England?	spk_66

Many people do not know that this process is ongoing, or should be ongoing, at this present time.

I will be supporting the Bill. As I have said before, adoptees are entitled to know who they are and where they come from. If their parents do not want to meet with them or whatever, that is fine. That is their business and they are entitled to do that too. These human beings are entitled to know who they are, however. I have to say to the Minister that the Government has behaved very badly over the past few months on the issue of mother and baby homes. It was trying to hide records by storing them away for 30 years. Was that to make sure that all those affected would be all dead before they could access them? There are records where details are crossed out with a marker. It is said that it was the same marker used throughout. We need to know who did that. I thank RTÉ for its wonderful programme on adoption recently in which people told us their personal stories. It was really heart breaking to see what had happened. Several people were involved in the sale of these babies. It looks to me that they were sold and their names and their mother's names were crossed out to ensure nobody would know who they were. It was done by the same marker. This is a shame and disgrace. I will support Sinn Féin's Bill.	spk_19

I ask the Minister to recognise the difficulties that exist in rural areas. I ask that the Minister be on the ball this year when and if students have to access accommodation. We had the story last year where students sought accommodation, got it and paid for it but when they went to attend classes, the colleges did not open at all. That cannot happen again. I appreciate that the Minister will let students know in a timely fashion what the scenario will be. We need more places for students, as the Minister is aware. Students completed the leaving certificate late last year. These students will be coming on stream together with those who will be sitting the leaving certificate later this year. I acknowledge and appreciate the new dimension for apprenticeships. I want the Minister to explore that and to advise students that there is a need for apprenticeships, whether that is for carpentry, plumbing, electrical work or whatever because we need these apprentices for housebuilding. There is a serious shortage in all areas of apprenticeship. We need to encourage students to go that way because we will need them if the economy is to keep going and if we are to continue to build houses and improve infrastructure.

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-03-10	dail	33	Land Development Agency Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_16	I am glad to have an opportunity to talk on this very important matter. Housing is the dominant issue that we are asked about every day.I appreciate that the Minister is trying to do something about it. While I might not agree with the Land Development Agency aspect, it is not personal. It is my view versus the Minister's. I, too, compliment the local authority in Kerry on what it has done in very difficult times to provide housing. While it has a fairly hefty housing list all the time, it continues to do its best. It has done so going back as far I can remember, during which time it built rural cottages and brought out demountable homes. In this regard, I can think of a special man who did an awful lot of work and who I am not sorry to mention, namely, Mr. John O'Donoghue from Knockaderry, Farranfore. He was a clerk of works but he carried out some works and organised some houses. He used local builders who employed local tradesmen. They did magnificent work with very little. They did not have teleporters or much of the modern equipment available to builders today but, nevertheless, they had a massive housing programme over the years. The only thing we are short of now is finance.  I am not happy about the Land Development Agency and have significant concerns about it because it is removing accountability from ordinary elected members, ordinary county councillors who have done their best over the years and who are still doing their best in Kerry County Council. I acknowledge there are problems acquiring land and getting houses built here in Dublin, which may have tempted the Government to go the way it is going. Maybe that approach is needed in Dublin but it is not needed in Kerry. I have concerns over public lands being handed over to private developers. Like Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, I have nothing against developers but I believe public lands should remain in public ownership. It would be fine if the developers built the social or affordable housing for the local authority but I am very concerned about the Government's statement that they could acquire public lands, and even private lands, at agricultural prices. It could create a civil war in a town or county if land were purchased compulsorily from private people. I would be very worried about that. I am also worried about accountability. It is accountability that we need. We have lost accountability in many of the sectors. Where roads are concerned, when a councillor puts down a motion in Kerry County Council, the request is sent on to Transport Infrastructure Ireland. It is a step removed. Refuse collection is working fine in our county but in other places, the local authorities have no role in it. We are lucky in Kerry with the refuse collection. Town councils did great work in their towns but they were abolished. They were very necessary for local representation. I rue the day that they were abolished. There are various schemes that the Minister could help us with. The tenant purchase scheme is not working. Those who have been paying rent for 30 or 40 years are not allowed to purchase their house if they are not working and have become pensioners. The scheme was abolished for a number of years and the affected individuals exceeded the maximum age before it was reinstated. No one is allowed to purchase any house built since 2015. Normally, they could be purchased after 12 months. Rural cottages are very hard to get built in our county. We cannot get enough money. The scheme that was in place was great. A young couple could provide a site, more often than not on their family-owned land, and could pay back the council the cost of the house when they got up and running. The council, in turn, was able to build more houses. This helped to pay for the voids. Kerry County Council is doing well enough now but, for a period, it was struggling seriously because it did not have the money to turn the voids around and put people back into the houses. Many couples would build their own house if they could get planning permission. That is all they want. The urban-generated pressure clause is depriving many couples of the ability to build their own house. The Government is saying people should consider building in towns and villages. We do not have the sewerage schemes. I hear the Green Party talking every day about the environment, stating we must protect it. I want to protect it as much as anyone else but these people do not want to talk about the sewerage schemes. Places such as Scartaglin have no sewerage scheme. They have proud communities. Brosna is another example. In Kenmare town, a developer who has got planning permission cannot proceed with a development because the sewerage scheme is not adequate. It is being said that money will be got but that has been said for a long time. There are other issues, including those affecting young couples. Consider the case of a young couple who obtained planning permission and built a house without any loan. They have the roof on and the windows and doors in, and all they need is money for the wiring and plumbing, but they will not qualify for the grant of €30,000 because they did not get a mortgage. One of the conditions to qualify for the grant is that the applicant has a mortgage. The county council cannot give the couple a loan because they do not have a greenfield site. That is absolutely ridiculous. Another case involves a grand young fellow who only wanted to borrow €100,000 to build his house. He could do a lot of the work and had enough money to go so far but no bank would give him the €100,000. The banks would not lend without lending the entire cost of the house. Can the Minister understand how ridiculous that is? There are rules and regulations on planning and getting a small bit of help that are driving people down through the ground. The levies and charges for connecting to the local sewerage and water systems and for connecting the electricity are absolutely ridiculous. If the Government really wants to help people — I know it would like to — it will have to suss out the amount of VAT and other taxes chargeable. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae stated, the cost of materials has become very high but, on top of that cost is the cost of the VAT and other taxes. It is nailing people to the cross. Many would try to build a house for themselves and would do their very best but they are nailed by rules, regulations, levies and charges. Many who want to build a one-off house in Kerry cannot get planning permission. They would gladly build if they got a small bit of help. I ask the Minister to get someone to reconsider the urban-generated clause that is depriving so many of planning permission in Kerry – people who just want to put a roof over their heads with hardly any help required from anyone else.	spk_232

Very few are being granted despite the Bill that was passed recently in the Dáil. Munster Joinery employs 1,400 people on the Cork-Kerry border and has done so for years. Kelly's of Ballydesmond has been supplying the timber to the Munster Joinery plant for many years. However, since 9 September last year, Kelly's has not brought one stick of timber into that plant. The company has put in 27 applications for felling licences but none of them has been granted. One of those licence applications goes back to 2013.

Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-03-03	dail	33	Housing Shared Equity Loan Scheme: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_2	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this very important housing matter. There is a large cohort of young people in Kerry who cannot get planning permission to build close to their family homes because of a thing called an urban-generated pressure clause. That clause is there to prevent people from coming out from towns and building in rural areas, but it is affecting people in rural areas as well. If one is not a son or daughter of a local, one cannot buy a site. People cannot get planning permission next door to their family home if the land is not owned by their family. That is a serious issue. Levies are now so high that they have become an exorbitant cost. In the case of the county council levies, rural people are being asked to pay for amenities in urban areas. That is wrong. The levies being imposed by Irish Water and the VAT charges are making up more than one third of the cost of building a house. This is ruling many young couples out of being able to build their own home, which is what they want to do. It has been mentioned before that many of our towns and villages do not have sewerage schemes or do not have adequate schemes. In my county, Currow has no sewerage scheme, and Scartaglin, Brosna and Caherdaniel are some of the many places in trouble in this regard. Even if somebody wanted to build a development in Kenmare, it would not be possible to do so because the sewerage scheme is not adequate.	spk_29

The banks are going, the post offices have gone and many of the pubs are closed. There is not going to be much left. It is like the 2040 plan, where everything is geared towards the five big cities with planning, housing, money and all kinds of infrastructure, and rural Ireland is forgotten about. It must be recognised that if you live in a place like Shronahiree in Glencar or Derrynafeana or the Black Valley and the bank in Killorglin closes down, where are you to go then? Likewise in north Kerry with Tralee, Castleisland and Abbeyfeale. Where did the people of Knockafreaghaun, Muinganear and Brosna go to, only to Abbeyfeale? They have massive distances to travel now. If we put those placenames into a computer to see where is the nearest Bank of Ireland branch, it would take a day to get there and back. The Minister has a role to play here. The people are entitled to services. The people in rural Ireland are entitled to the same services as the people in Dublin 4. I heard one Deputy say that this will also have an impact in Dublin but if we take a walk around the streets of Dublin, we will pass three or four different banks in ten minutes. That is massively different to the set up in rural Kerry. I am asking the Minister to realise that he can do something here. He has a share in Bank of Ireland. Surely he can demand of it or at least sit down and talk with it. I want to say to the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that they will have to collar their Ministers and their Taoiseach in their party rooms and tell them that this is not good enough for rural Ireland.	spk_305

I thank the Social Democrats for bringing the motion before the House. I support it. People around the country are outraged at the Government and what it is doing, and has done over the past number of months, to the survivors. First, it tried to lock away the records for 30 years. What is it trying to hide? Why is it blackguarding these poor people who have been through hell on earth as it is, and have come this far? Many of them did not survive at all. Why is it doing this to these people? The Minister has been dishonest by saying that he is not opposing motion, but he will still not extend the life of the commission. The life of the commission was extended a number of times before. Why can the Minister not do it once again? We are close to revelations being made and getting to the truth. The Government does not want the truth to come out. Why is it blackguarding these people? These people are entitled to know who they are, where they came from and who their mothers and grandmothers were, like the rest of us. It is natural for us to know who we are and who came before us. The Minister is being very unfair in this. Once again, the Government is showing its dishonesty towards the people. Even people who are not involved are outraged by what the Government is doing. It is very unfair. I call on the Minister to extend the life of the commission and to give the survivors the information that they want. They are surely entitled to it. It is a human matter. These people should be treated fairly. The Minister should not blackguard them, as he has for the past number of months. We fought the Government hard here in the House on the locking away of the files for 30 years. The Government stuck together and voted the motion down and then the following day said that was not what it was doing at all. The Minister is not codding the people-----	spk_22

A 70-year old woman received a quote for more than €800 when she went to renew her insurance last year. Her son rang the same company to see what was the matter. He was a big customer as he had a lot of vehicles. He was asked if she was actually his mother. They gave her the insurance for €370 after. Can one imagine that? It was almost €500 of a difference. Young drivers are paralysed before they get on the road at all. What is happening is very wrong. They are being charged €3,000 to €5,000 for their first insurance after doing all their driving lessons. It is very clear what is happening to taxis, commercial drivers, passenger buses, hauliers, pubs, restaurants and hotels. There is not enough competition. Not since Seán Quinn are we getting a fair crack of the whip for insurance. When it comes to the cost of claims, it has been said that the people of Ireland must have brass necks, but I say they have gold necks because a whiplash in Ireland costs approximately €70,000 while in the UK it is €7,000. What is the difference in the necks here and the necks there? The difference is that we are paying more for the insurance. We are paying through the neck for it. What is happening is very wrong. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to do something. I have one worry about Deputy Doherty's Bill, which I will support. Will the insurance companies listen? Will they bring down the cost of insurance if we get rid of differential pricing or will they put it up? That is my worry.	spk_21

They are worried that many farmers will not even qualify for those schemes and that much of the funding would go to administration. Subsidy payments from the EU are, and were supposed to be, compensation for farmers for producing cheaper food for the consumers of Europe. Payments are not a gift. Eco schemes, it appears to many, are to satisfy dreams, paralyse farmers and deprive them of finance they badly need. The cost of feeding and fertiliser is another issue. Another issue is dog control in places like Shrone. Walkers with dogs that are not tied up are worrying sheep in those places.

Even though the time is short, I am grateful for it. I have to say to the members of the Labour Party that they must realise that the longer businesses are shut and the longer the doors are closed, the harder it will be to get these people's businesses back open again. It is far easier to shut places down and to keep them locked down. It is much harder to open them up. As a business person who has employed people, I know the value of business to the working person. Businesses are about giving employment to people. If the businesses are shut and SMEs are closed, locked down and locked down further, there is less of a chance of them opening back up again. On the talk about the schools certainly not opening before St. Patrick's Day, I would hope that the schools would open before then and maybe a long time before then. Labour has to consider what the lockdown is doing to people's minds. I refer to people in rural places who are locked down and cannot come out and have a short conversation with anyone. Members of the Labour Party do not realise that because they are far removed from what is going on in rural areas. Mental health is a big issue. For instance, people trying to build their own house or who are trying to get in a carpenter or a plumber to do work to finish off a house are stopped from doing so at present.	spk_31

I support the call for the increase in the fuel allowance and to allow others on social welfare to access the fuel allowance. As has already been mentioned, 15 months is too long for someone to wait if he or she cannot afford heating. My real problem is with the Government and its policies that increase the cost of fuel, coal and briquettes and put them out of the reach of ordinary people who are on social welfare or the old age pension. Those people have to count every penny as they go. Briquettes were among the available forms of heating. Women, young and old people picked up a couple of bales of briquettes that were easy to handle and clean, and provided good heat.We are being told by the Government that we will not have them any more in a couple of years. It is saying it will be four years before they are finished, but I think it will be a lot sooner than that. The Government is driving people to use electricity. It says electricity is the way to go and that we should have electric cars, but does the Government not realise that the cost of electricity has gone up? The Government is promoting electric cars, yet we are told it will cost €26,000 to put a kerbside charging point in a housing estate. Does the Government stand over that? Then the Government tells people they cannot cut turf. Where I come from, people went out into the countryside and they were proud to cut turf in the summer time and to dry it and bring it home. They were proud to cut timber and put it into a shed to dry before they used it. They were proud to sit in front of their fires, which kept them warm, going back decades and centuries. The Taoiseach is following the Green Party out the gap like a dog following a flock of sheep. He is doing everything it tells him. Last night we heard the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, boasting that we are going to lead the way. I remind him that we are a small country and if we were to turn out the lights and leave this wonderful country we are living in, it would only make 0.13 of 1% in the overall context of reducing carbon emissions. We are all under the one sky. Is this what the Government has done to rural Ireland?	spk_26

Children are vulnerable and, as elected representatives, we must do everything to ensure they are properly looked after. This time of virus has been a concerning and upsetting time for many children. They are away from their schools, hobbies and friends. Many teachers in many schools are entrusted with the job of seeing that children are fed properly, given meals and looked after in certain ways. I worry that they have been missing all this for most of last year and again this year. I sincerely hope these children are not hungry. It is the one reason I hope the schools will be open, especially special needs schools. These special children need special attention and they have been denied that. We know that they go into reverse quickly if their routine is not continued. I hope there will be no other blockage to prevent special needs school children from going back to their schools, crèches and places of care that they were used to attending. It has been a trying time for all children of school-going age because they are away from their friends, hobbies and sports. We must recognise and hope they will be back doing the things they want to do. Children get tired of being in the one place or being at home in a room if the day is wet or whatever. We need to hope this vaccine is rolled out and that children and teachers can get back to school. The current uncertainty cannot continue or be allowed to arise again in respect of any cohort of children.	spk_277

I thank Deputy Pringle and the Independent Group for giving us the chance to do that. Since becoming an elected Member many years ago, the most predominant problem that presents on a daily basis is housing for people. In Kerry there is a great housing department in the local authority, which does its level best to look after those who present for social housing, and continues to do so in tough times when there is little funding. We seem to be doing very well, but funding is an issue all the time. Up here, we continue to fight their case to get more funding. Housing is very important and it is right that people should be housed. We must ensure that people have proper homes to live in and in which to bring up their families. The other important issue that is causing an awful lot of problems currently concerns medical and health services. As we know, people are being denied services in our county and indeed right around the country. This includes simple procedures such as the removal of cataracts to prevent people from going blind. It is an indictment on the HSE and our health service that we have to take people to the North of Ireland so that they do not go blind and continue to suffer pain. It is like the agony in the garden when they suffer with pain in their hips and knees and so on. It is wrong that people have to wait for years to get simple procedures done. In spite of all the money the HSE gets, it is still unable to provide a proper service. Work is important. People who want to work should be given the chance to do so. I applaud both small and large employers, who, despite all they have to face, employ people. They are going through a lot just to be allowed to do that. There are so many regulations and rules they must adhere to and the cost of insurance and red tape makes it hard for them to create jobs for people.	spk_14
Danny HealyRae	68	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2021-01-27	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_4	I wish to raise the lack of funding for Kerry roads on our local improvement scheme, LIS, list. This scheme has been in place for more than 40 years to resurface public roads not in the charge of the local authority. I am talking about public roads, not private roads. To qualify for the LIS, there must be at least two landholdings. I know of several roads that have anything from eight or nine landholdings and five to 20 or more houses. County Kerry's new 2020 list started out with 707 applications that were prioritised. We got just enough funding to do ten roads last year, leaving 697 more to be done. If we only do ten roads each year it will take 69 or 70 years to complete our list. Our last priority list of 2007 had approximately 350 applications. We were doing fine up until 2012 when the scheme was suspended. I know the Department of Finance is against this scheme because it believes the taxpayer is paying for the surfacing of private roads. We are not talking about private roads, however. These are public roads. The people I am talking about are on public and not private roads. The scheme was suspended in 2012. After being elected to Dáil Éireann in 2016, I made several representations and requests in the rural affairs committee to the then Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, to reactivate the scheme, which he did in 2017. I thank him for that and for giving us funding to finish off the 2007 programme. From 2007 to 2012, Kerry County Council accepted 118 new applications, which were kept on file and are now also included in the 707 applications on the 2020 list. Imagine applying in 2007 to get your road upgraded. We are still waiting in 2021 and will perhaps wait for several more years. Will the Government be fair to the people in rural Ireland? Many of these people are elderly, and perhaps sick, and carers and home help workers are trying to get in and out on roads that are in a desperate state. People living on these roads are entitled to a good road to their door, the same as the people in Dublin 4. I say again that these roads are not private; they are public. I know the Department of Finance was trying to stop funding on that basis back in 2010. These people have paid their motor, property and income tax and their insurance. In most cases, they have their own water supply and septic tanks and do not even have broadband. I believe they are entitled to a reasonable road surface to their homes.	spk_34

Again, I want to make it clear that this scheme was suspended for five years from 2012 to 2017, which is why we have a savage amount of applications now. Some 697 applications are still waiting to get funding. Many of these have been waiting since 2007. I appeal to the Taoiseach. The amount of money we got last year was something in the region of €700,000. That is not enough. Like I said, if we continue in that vein of doing ten roads each year, it will take us 70 years to exhaust the list. That is not fair on these people. They are good, honest, hard-working people who are trying to exist where their fathers before them lived. They want to continue living in these places. They are, however, entitled to a good surface on their road, the same as the people in Dublin 4 are getting. These people should not be left behind. They contribute to this scheme. They pay 20% of the cost and the Department has always made up 80% of it. Do not let these people in rural Ireland down. They vote for the Taoiseach as well as everyone else. I am appealing to him.

Special needs schools are closed.

Mineral water distributors are not closed down but more than 90% of their customers are not buying from them. In fact the distributors have to take back bottles at their own cost and dump the stuff. Taxi drivers in Killarney feel they have been let down. Some of them can get the PUP and more of them who tried to operate cannot do so because they have no customers. I went into College Street the other night and there was one taxi there. I know that some of these taxi drivers will have to give back their taxis in the near future because they just cannot make the payments. I am sad to see that those grand men and women who gave such sterling service in Killarney and outside of it will lose their way of life and will have to surrender. Coach operators were an important part of the tourism sector in Kerry. It is sad to see yards full of buses, with up to 90 buses in some yards in Killarney, that have not moved in the past 12 months or more. It is tough on these people, who gave such sterling service with their drivers and the type of buses they provided, that they have been left behind as well.

Other Members have asked about the €477 million. We need more clarity on how this figure came about and how much of it applies to Ireland. I sincerely hope farmers or people who could or would have benefited from funds like this will not be denied this money as a result of this or any other fraud. None of us in the House condone or support fraud and we are certainly behind any laws that would prevent same. It was mentioned that dogs and pets are being stolen. I know one person who had a very valuable dog and he is fairly sure that it was stolen recently, or anyway he cannot find the dog, and it disappeared for no reason. I know too well about pets. We had a pony ourselves, Peig, and she was stolen. It gave my father desperate concern at the time because he used to go up and feed her every day and, all of a sudden, she was missing. It took three months or more to find her but we did find her, thankfully. I thank all those who were involved, including Detective Sullivan from Castletownbere, who played a massive role in ensuring we found the pony. I know the anxiety and the pressure that was on my father and my younger family members when that pony was stolen. I thank everyone who helped in the recovery and return of Peig, who we still have and take pride in having, and we see after her in the best way we can. What springs to mind is the situation of old people being robbed in their homes and being so concerned about being robbed or broken into. When people move on in years, they are not as courageous when people drive into the yard and they are worried. I know one great friend of ours, and when someone drives the long road up to his house and he sees the car coming, he would go out the door of the house and into the outbuildings, and he would wait in the yard and peep from some angle until he was sure it was not thieves or blackguards, and that at least it was someone he knew or that they had a good reason for coming to visit him. There are other types of what I would call fraud when a property is rendered of less value. What I am talking about is designations, whereby environmentalists and others seek to reduce the value of property by placing designations on land that farmers may have bought and paid for at high cost, or inherited, and their pride in their place could not be exceeded by anyone. Sadly, in some places, land has been designated for the hen harrier or for different reasons, and we hear that more of the countryside is going to be designated as special areas of conservation. This will definitely reduce the value of their properties. There is also the situation where environmentalists want to stop us cutting turf. Turf is of value to the people who own the bog in that they can cut and save turf, and keep themselves warm. We hear of others suffering fuel poverty. What do they want these people to do? Do they want them to suffer fuel poverty as well, with the bog lying idle on their land? Will they stop them cutting it like they have done for generations and for centuries back, without doing any harm to themselves or anyone else? Their pride in their property could not be exceeded by any environmentalist.	spk_211

Young boys and girls, when they choose to become a nurse, see it as more than a career. It is a vocation for them and they deserve fairness and respect. A payment of €100 for a young nurse when his or her work is so demanding is not fair. We hear stories that many of them have to choose between the bus fare or food. That is not right and we cannot allow it to continue. Other tradespeople, including plumbers, plasterers, mechanics and electricians, all get paid as apprentices. We see what student nurses have to go through, working with all the different health problems patients present with, including cancer, heart problems, respiratory problems and people who are broken up and mangled after an accident. It must be very traumatic for those young nurses to see people dying in their arms. They have to go home and keep all of that within themselves because confidentiality does not allow them to discuss their job or their work with family members or other people. I am pleading with the Minister and the Government to ensure that fairness will apply. The €100 the Minister is thinking of giving student nurses is not adequate. He will have to stand up to the mark and pay these people for doing the very important work they are doing on our behalf, especially during the Covid crisis, and the sacrifices they are making and have made on behalf of each and every one of us. I ask the Minister to read the motion and not to go against it.	spk_23

We all appreciate that home helps and people on the front line have to be vaccinated first but I want people to be aware of the number of businesses whose doors are closed in County Kerry and in the town of Killarney, which has not a light in it. The Taoiseach is at the wheel. He is the Taoiseach of the country and is the Head of the Government. I ask that he rescues and salvages the tourism industry for the people in Kerry and all around the Ring of Kerry and to think of all the coach operators whose buses are parked in their yards. The Taoiseach must be aware of this and pull out all the stops to ensure vaccination. At 100,000 vaccines per month, it would take eight years to vaccinate all the people in the country. The Taoiseach must wake up and take serious action to ramp up the vaccinations because that is what is needed at this time and no more lockdowns.	spk_108

I see a noticeable reduction in the number of lorries going through Kilgarvan village from Castletownbere. They traditionally travelled that way every evening and night. There has already been a serious reduction in traffic on that route. Many businesses throughout the County of Kerry have contacted me regarding problems with data protection in respect of goods they have traditionally sourced from the UK which they are having brought in by couriers and hauliers. They say that they have to complete unnecessary invoices specifying the goods and their cost as the couriers and hauliers need them to get through customs. They are worried that this will expose them to more competition as the cost of everything will be known, as will what they get for their produce after bringing it in. Regulatory barriers are a problem.This is one of them. We hear much about data protection. We must look after our businesses here; they are bad enough with the coronavirus and everything else. These invoices should not need to be shown. There should be some other way such as a customs clearance certificate not specifying the value of their goods or how much they paid for them. I ask the Minister to ensure that problem is sorted out. There is agri-friction in respect of the British bringing beef and other food into their country. That will definitely have a negative impact on our farmers and we must do our best to ensure that we do not accommodate those outside sources in the European Union in order to counteract them.	spk_139

It was told it would not be let in until, perhaps, 31 January or perhaps not even then. What investigations have taken place or what has the Taoiseach asked the WHO about what happened?

First, I ask, like others, who leaked the report. Was it strategy by the Government? How did it happen? Who leaked it and who was given copies of it? I welcome the State and other bodies saying they are sorry but I believe the law of the land should be applied wherever it can be in any cases that need to be remedied or sorted out. To go back only a few years, we saw how willing was the State to get involved in County Kerry with the Kerry babies case. We know what wrongs happened there, yet the Garda was used to the maximum there. The murder squad and the highest people in that force were down there at that time. It amazes me that this saga continued until 1998. I did not know that. The Government Members voted a few weeks ago to hide and stash away details of people for 30 years. They got it in the neck, however, from people around the country and were sorry a couple of days later. Now they are trying to remedy themselves. It is a fundamental right of any person to know who he or she is, where he or she came from, who his or her parents were or as much knowledge as can be obtained. People are entitled to know that and it should not be hidden away from them anywhere. What happened was wrong. Pregnant girls were forced into mother and baby homes and even into county homes and boys and girls were forced to go out to work as hard as they could for wealthy farmers. That was wrong and on top of that, they were not treated like human beings. Many of them were fed in the yard or the dairy or their dinner was handed out the window to them. That was wrong and I resent and reject those people who did those bad things to other people because human life is precious. Everyone has the same right to live and should be treated equally. Clearly, these people in our past were not so treated. If there are any people still wandering around from 1998 or back to 1988 that have done wrong, they should be apprehended and brought to task for it.	spk_109

All patients and front-line staff in public homes that house those with physical and mental disabilities, such as the Cheshire home, Deer Lodge and Cherryfield House in Killarney, should be vaccinated sooner rather than later. The workers who are doing such great work should be vaccinated as soon as possible. Home helps and carers who are in and out of the homes of the elderly and who do great work day in, day out, to ensure the elderly and those with disabilities can remain in their own homes for as long as possible should receive the utmost attention and the vaccine as soon as possible. What does the Minister know about the new pneumonia virus that we hear has arrived in Wuhan? Will all our own people be vaccinated here before this new virus comes from there? What does the Minister know about it? He needs to let people know about it. I am glad that, at last, after my calling for it for months, the Government is now asking that people who intend to come to this country by air be tested within the three days prior to flying. I have been asking for this for so long. It is not that I am against people coming home because that is not the way I want it; I want people to come home but everyone needs to have a test before coming here. How much of the Citywest Hotel is being used? Are we still paying for it? There is an anomaly whereby people are flying into Belfast and coming down here without any test. The same story applies here in that people using Dublin Airport are saying they are going to Belfast, yet they are coming into the Twenty-six Counties.

Anywhere they were required, they did their level best and did Trojan work. I have to say to the Minister that people have been dying from things other than the coronavirus. People with cancer and people with hip and knee difficulties and so on have been left behind to suffer in pain. In time the tale will be told of the damage and neglect that has been meted out to these people. Elderly and sick people in their homes have by and large been left to their own devices because GPs could not go to their homes. In severe cases, all people could do was to go to the accident and emergency department. Even people who had paid for private healthcare have been neglected. They could not access the services they had paid for and rightly deserved to get because the public hospitals took over the private hospitals. They were left behind. The cross-border directive is in serious jeopardy. Deputy Michael Collins and I are at our wits' end because we do not know what will happen after 31 January. It was so important to keep that system going to ensure that people did not lose their sight or that they would not continue to suffer in pain. It seems that the Taoiseach is not interested in keeping that service going. I mention mental health and suicide among middle-aged people and loneliness. A recent damning report by the Mental Health Commission cited major deficiencies in the level of mental healthcare for patients in Kerry and it is getting worse rather than better. The Minister and the Taoiseach said the Government would provide more district beds and beds for people who needed to go into hospital. What it has done is close down beds in our district hospitals. In one public nursing home in Killarney, the Government has closed 27 beds and they are still closed. School transport and the 50% rule really came to light in Kerry. The Government did not give people the service and the way it was done was that people who always had tickets to go to the secondary school did not get tickets until recently and not all of them have their tickets yet. Even college students in Killarney were disenfranchised. They could not go to Tralee because Bus Éireann put on another run from Dingle to Killarney and Tralee. However, Bus Éireann did not have drivers to continue the school bus going to the Institute of Technology Tralee from Killarney and it left 18 to 20 students standing on the side of the road for several days. Rural pubs have been closed all year. The owners of those pubs are suffering mentally and financially because of that. I mention the people who used to frequent those pubs, including the people from the hills and glens of Kerry. Many of them have not seen a pint since last March and it could be next March or farther on before they get one. How is it that farm inspections are still taking place? They are taking place on behalf of all the agencies, even though when farmers or business people want something, the reason given for not helping them is that no one can come out to help due to the coronavirus.However, the enforcement officers and inspectors can go out. The banks are using the coronavirus to safeguard themselves. Many young people who are rightfully entitled to and who want to put a roof over their heads, and who should be lauded for that given what is happening with the social housing list, are being ignored by the banks. Even though we as a nation bailed out the banks, they are ignoring the young people who want to access a mortgage for the purpose of putting a roof over their heads. That is a disaster. The Government will have to call them aside and ensure people get what they rightfully deserve.	spk_12

It is very important that we all recognise the fact that an atom bomb or nuclear weapon could end all of the talk and all of the work in seconds if it was deployed near us or even far from us. Pope Francis expressed his horror at the effects of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. He said that, ""We must never grow weary of working to support the principal international legal instruments of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, including the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons."" He went on to say that, ""The use of atomic energy for purposes of war is immoral, just as the possessing of nuclear weapons is immoral."" I worry about the countries that did not sign the TPNW. The USA, Russia, China, Britain, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel boycotted the negotiations. That is very serious and we should never let them forget it. Our Government should keep reminding them and working to the principle that we must not use nuclear or atomic weapons in any struggle or strife. We must remember what happened in Chernobyl and in Nagasaki - the massive destruction, the damage done to man, woman and child and all forms of life, including animals and fauna. Everything was wiped out. It is really serious. We saw the little children who came to this country from Chernobyl who were missing hands, feet, legs and limbs. What these weapons can do is so devastating. We must work together in this Parliament to ensure that we get the message across that there is no place for nuclear weapons because they could lead to the destruction of the entire world."	spk_9

We really wish to do so. I thank the Sinn Féin Party for bringing the Bill before us. Speaking honestly, it deals with one of the biggest problems any elected public representative has, whether a Member of Dáil Éireann, a county councillor or whatever. Housing is the big issue of the day and ensuring people have a roof over their head is a very laudable aspiration. One of the issues I have been raising for quite a while is the social housing income cap which is responsible for people not getting on the housing list or being thrown off the list because they are above it. I do not know whether the caps are the same in different local authority areas. In Kerry, a couple with three children who go over €33,600 will be thrown off the list or cannot get on it. It is very unfortunate. I have found that, in many instances, what puts a couple over the cap is family income supplement. If people are in need of family income supplement, they surely are in need of a local authority house because they are not in a position to build a house or get a loan. That issue needs to be addressed.I asked the previous Government to rectify this and I am asking the same of the current Government. The Government says that it is reducing housing lists, but they are being reduced unfairly. Some 33,600 people cannot get loans from any of the financial institutions. Different types of homeless people seem to be put into the same place. They may be suffering from addiction. That is not acceptable. In Kerry, we seem to be going backwards. The homes of farmers and rural people fall into disrepair and they cannot live in them. Sometimes the houses fall down. We used to be able to provide demountable dwellings for those people, but that does not happen any more. Not enough rural cottages are being built.	spk_277

Even though Kerry County Council grants permission, this person appeals it to An Bord Pleanála and it always seems to happen that the planning permission is refused then. In Tomies, the late Seán Sweeney - I will name him because he went on television and went public about it - fought tooth and nail to get planning permission for his son. It was granted by Kerry County Council on two or three occasions and it was objected to and refused. That man has not yet got planning. A man from Muckross got permission from Kerry County Council and this serial objector objected. He was working 6 km away in Liebherr's and he made that objection. He lost his planning permission. Another McCarthy family in Lauragh Upper had 365 acres, all in special areas of conservation, SAC, but Kerry County Council, in its wisdom, granted permission. An Taisce, someone 72 miles away, appealed this decision, the decision was lost and they never got permission. The young fellow, who wanted to live beside his mother after his father dying, was denied that right. Lauragh school is in trouble. Does the Taoiseach see that this rural settlement policy is denying several people? For a couple from Glencar - they are only 2 miles from Killorglin and 2 miles from Beaufort - it was a massive struggle to get permission in Beaufort even though they were only 2 miles away from there. The Government tells us to build in the villages and the towns but with places like Kilcummin, there is no sewage treatment plan. You will not get permission in Glenbeigh, Abbeydorney or Brosna and yet the places are practically desolated. Curra was promised in 1986. For former Deputy Tom Fleming and me, Scartaglin was number three on the list; now it is on no list. Half of the massive town of Castleisland is on septic tanks. However, to say that people should move into towns is wrong too because the State does not have the infrastructure there. We must appreciate young couples who go to the trouble of building a house for themselves as we know the cost and the trouble it takes to build social houses for people who cannot afford to build a house for themselves. In many instances, the trouble is to get planning. We must do something about it.	spk_21

In a case in Belgium seven or eight years ago, the judge decided it was wrong to have designations blocking people from getting planning permission. That judgment is there and it will be contested at some stage by someone. The Government is leaving itself open to that. There is a problem in weaker rural areas. In the case of my own road from Loo Bridge to Morley's Bridge, which is 4 or 5 miles long, there were 16 or 17 families living there but now one cannot get permission to build. In the case of one of those families, there were 16 reared in a cottage on an acre. That is the gospel truth. One cannot get permission to build along that road now because it is part of a designated disadvantaged area, whereas the other side of the road is stronger. It is in the Government guidelines that the designated disadvantaged areas have to be taken together. That is what is wrong. There are another couple of townlands up the Shandrum Road where there were 24 families living. People cannot get planning permission in those places and no one can come in and build there. A lot of people are being told that they can work from home but it is not possible to get planning permission for sites in those places.	spk_25

Other section 39 workers whose pay was reduced in 2010 have had their pay restored since 2018. Why are these people neglected? They are preparing to go on strike. It is sad to think that these staff members, drivers and workers, who work late at night and give so much to the SouthDoc service in Killarney, are being left behind. I call on the Minister of State to ensure this matter is rectified immediately. The risks faced by nurses on the front line must be taken into account. Like senior nurses and all others on the front line, student nurses are putting themselves and their families in jeopardy. They can contract the virus while working and take it home. I am pleading with the Minister of State. This is very important. The Government must restore pay to section 39 workers and respect student nurses.	spk_22

What he has done, no other Fianna Fáil leader or Taoiseach in the past would have done to rural Ireland. What the Taoiseach has done is anti-village and anti-rural. Publicans and customers will have no Christmas. They are saying the Taoiseach does not care and that he has his job for another year or so and he is happy with that. The Taoiseach has belittled rural publicans and rural people. He does not trust them. Yet, there will certainly be plenty of unregulated drinking, as the Taoiseach and I know, and we will need good strong jeeps and vehicles to find them. Talking about Roald Dahl and Mr. Fox and that kind of nonsense on the radio or television is no compensation to the people of rural Ireland. Where is the Taoiseach's evidence and scientific proof that pubs in rural Ireland were the cause or would be the cause of transmitting the virus? Where is that evidence?

The first thing relates to fisheries. I appeal to the Minister of State not to leave our fishermen short. Their job is onerous and dangerous at the best of times. There are many in the Dingle Peninsula, Cahersiveen, Castletown Berehaven and all along the Kenmare Estuary. They depend a great deal on fishing. It is the one product that goes up through our village day and night. I am proud to see each load that passes up and glad to see it happening. As Deputy O'Donoghue said, there is a problem and it has been highlighted. It is about meat-based products, including mincemeat and sausages. That must be sorted out. We must have adequate capacity for live exports and shipping. The Government seems to be saying that it is making progress, but I anticipate there will be queues and problems. These need to be sorted out. There is supposed to be a problem with spuds and getting spuds from the UK. Let them keep their spuds if they do not want to sell them to us. We can plant our own spuds. Let them stuff Boris with the spuds they have and we will manage fine without their spuds. We are at the right time of the year. The Government should get out now and advertise this. It should tell farmers there is an opening for planting spuds. We are at the right time of the year. Perhaps the Government could assist them by providing seed potatoes or whatever. Now is the time to do it. I have raised the most important thing in the House before, as has Deputy Michael Collins. We are asking for a bilateral arrangement to allow patients to seek cataract removal in the North of Ireland, where we have been doing this for more than three years. I call on the Government to go into deep discussions to ensure the bilateral arrangement will continue after 31 December. The Government must ensure we will be able to see after people and ensure they will not go blind in the early months of next year. There is only a short timeline between needing the cataract removed urgently and going blind. I appeal to the Minister of State because that is the most important thing in all the talks that needs to be sorted out.	spk_167
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-12-02	dail	33	Finance Bill 2020: Report Stage	dbsect_19	"On keeping rural pubs closed, to give the Minister an idea of this situation, places like Gneevgullia, Scartaglin, Fieries, Curra, Headfort, Barraduff and Rathmore have no pubs that can open. A number of pubs can open in Killarney. On a Saturday night, about half the pubs in Killarney will be open. What is going to happen then? As sure as day follows night, there will be a bigger crowd in Killarney than ever before. The town is usually well able to cater for crowds, but now half the pubs will not be open. A combination of people will be coming into the town from Kilgarvan and even from parts of south Kerry where the pubs will not be able to open. They are all going to arrive into Killarney. For those who do not, shebeens will open up and, as I said earlier, the Garda will have to have very good jeeps and other vehicles to find them. It was easier to monitor and work with the regulated pubs. The Government is making a massive mistake in not allowing all pubs to open and spread people out. This is very wrong for the customers. We must talk about mental health because many customers in rural places will not be able to travel to places like Killarney, Tralee and other places with bigger pubs that able to cater for and serve food. They will not be able to travel those distances and no consideration has been given to this issue. From Mallow all the way to Killarney, there will not be a pub open in that vast countryside.It is absolutely ridiculous. I cannot understand it. I appeal to the Minister. I acknowledge his ability and his understanding but I ask him to get a hold of the rest of the members of the Cabinet and thrash this out. It is not making sense. I asked the Taoiseach today for the scientific evidence that suggests that rural pubs caused or spread the virus, or would spread the virus. Where is that scientific evidence? If we have it, or if the Minister has it somewhere, perhaps he would give it out to us. He has not listed it out to us yet. It is very wrong to penalise and not trust people. I trust the people who have a licensed premises. I trust the licensees. The vast majority, or 99% of them, are honest and hardworking people. It is a cry to God that the leaders of the country are not trusting these kinds of people. The question is ""Why?"" As my brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, has said, when the pandemic payment was given out all we asked for was that the people who were slightly over the age limit would get the extra bit to bring them up to the €350. They have outstanding costs, insurance costs and other services that they have to pay. When they pay for these they do not have enough to feed themselves. That has been happening all the year. It is very wrong that the Minister is not trusting our licensees in these rural places. This is not hurting Dublin at all because two thirds of the pubs in Dublin will be open because they are serving food. One third will remain closed but it is the other way down around our way where not even one third of our pubs will be able to reopen in all of Kerry. It is wrong. It is coming up to Christmas. It is hurting customers and it is hurting publicans. It is hurting each of them as much as the other. I ask the Minister to please look at it again because he is not being fair to honest, hardworking people. I ask the Minister to take another look at it and to take more consideration of what they do."	spk_286

Even though the incomes and businesses of fish suppliers, meat suppliers and vegetable suppliers that were supplying the hospitality sector have been washed up for the past number of weeks, Revenue has said they do not qualify because they were not officially closed down.

For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Labour Party and Sinn Féin are lining up here together and questioning the money that has been given to this very worthwhile industry.

I will not be supporting that at any time while I am a Member of Dáil Éireann. I refer to people who have done hard physical work all their lives and who are strangled and torn from it. I am thinking of farmers, plasterers and all the others who do physical work. Without a shadow of a doubt, they are entitled to get the pension at 65 years of age. Very little has been said about the people who create employment. It is very difficult and onerous to ensure one has workers' pay ready and on the table for them on a Friday evening.

It is their culture and their sport and they are entitled to have it, like everyone else. To say that it is wrong to give this money to the greyhound industry is totally wrong. These people deserve and are entitled to their sport. RTÉ said that 6,000 dogs were destroyed but that is wrong. I can give an example of a father and two sons who had 35 old dogs between them. They rehomed the animals themselves. They are looking after them. The dogs have hot floors and are being bedded, fed and kept right. There is a care fund for injuries and welfare, with 10% of admission fees and 5% of the Tote going towards animal welfare. There are greyhound care centres in Kerry, Tipperary, Limerick, Cork, Clare, Belfast and Dublin. There is a demand for old greyhounds abroad in places such as Montreal, the USA and mainland Europe, with people taking them as pets. Dogs have not been destroyed in the way suggested. These people are paying their way in betting taxes that they pay every night when they place their little bets. A lot of that money is going to the Central Fund when it should be going to the industry. I support the money provided by the Government to make up for lost gate receipts and returns that the industry did not enjoy this year because of the coronavirus.	spk_17

We have another new broadband plan but it has not hit Kerry yet. They must be rolling it out around the Curragh now because we seem to be as far away as ever from getting broadband in Kerry. Mobile phone coverage is a disaster in many parts of County Kerry. If one got off the plane in Farranfore, when the planes were running, there was no coverage on any of the three roads out of the airport. Places like Mastergeehy and Kilcummin have no broadband. The Minister referred to the local improvement scheme, LIS, earlier in her speech. I must remind her that it is not for private roads as such. It is for public roads that were never taken in charge by the county council. In Kerry, we have 750 applications for the LIS but we got €700,000 this year which did only ten roads. There is a savage number of roads on the list. With that funding, it will be 40 or 50 years before the LIS list is wiped out in Kerry. Will the Minister give enough for 100 roads? The people in rural Kerry are entitled to a good road to their doors, the very same as the people in Dublin 4. We are only going to build 13 rural cottages in Kerry from 2016 to 2021. That is a crying shame. When I raised it with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and Kerry County Council, one blamed the other. The fact remains that 13 rural cottages in five years is not fair play. I call for more rural transport and for Bus Éireann to put in place new early and late services from Kenmare to Killarney. The Government talks about people using public transport. Now is the time. The Green Party is in power and this is what it is spelling out. We want two more bus runs from Kenmare to Killarney early in the morning and late at night.The Government should put its money where its mouth is. These buses will not run without money. Group water schemes are in serious trouble. They are not getting funding. The grant for the treatment of wells was reduced by more than half, from €2,200 to €1,000. How is that fair play? I have the utmost respect for the Minister and I wish her well. I want to thank the former Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring, for bringing back the local improvement scheme. I call on the Minister to give proper funding to it.

Money has been announced for regional airports. I hope that Kerry Airport, which is under the stewardship of Mr. John Mulhern and his staff, most of whom are not working currently, gets a fair cut of this money. Shannon Airport is on its knees. It has been a transatlantic airport for many years, but that has been greatly reduced as a result of the cancelling of the compulsory stopover. Previously, Deputies and Governments knew the benefit of the compulsory stopover. Since it was taken away, all air traffic has gone to Dublin. This has happened at the direction of Fáilte Ireland, which is not selling Shannon Airport properly. We now hear that a third terminal is to be built in Dublin. As has been pointed out, it will not even be good for Dublin. This is unfair. All that we in the west and rural Ireland - places like Kerry, Limerick, Clare and Cork - want is a fair cut. We are not selfish, but it is like modern Governments and Dublin Deputies are focused on Dublin and Dublin only. I have been calling for testing at airports since the start. Where is the quarantining that was meant to be done by people travelling from other countries? It has not been happening. We are putting people in rural Ireland under pressure. The other day, we were told by Dr. Holohan that there would be no drinking in pubs this Christmas. That is a kind of dictatorship, yet at the same time we will open up air travel without knowing what effect doing so will have on people around the country. I am calling for connectivity for the people of Kerry and the western counties. It is only right that we get a fair cut and that the people of rural Ireland get a fair deal. They have not been getting one in recent times. Even before the coronavirus, Shannon Airport was on its knees and Kerry Airport had been struggling. Fáilte Ireland has not been selling our regional airports at all. Cork Airport is another airport that is vital to the people of Kerry. All we want is a fair cut, but we have not been getting one from this or recent Governments.	spk_20

What will happen on 1 January is of critical importance. It has significance for farmers, business exporters and importers, hauliers, fishermen and many other sectors of our economy. We were recently told by the Department of Finance that one worker in seven could lose his or her job because of Brexit. I fear it will hurt my part of the country, rural Ireland and particularly rural Kerry, worse than anywhere else. I ask and hope that the Government and the Minister can minimise the disruption to our economy in whatever way they can in the talks in the days and weeks before the end of the year.The Minister mentioned that residents of the North would be reimbursed if they had to travel to Europe, to the South of Ireland or to Dublin for medical treatment if, for whatever reason, they could not find a treatment in the Six Counties. The Minister did not mention a similar arrangement for our residents going northwards to Belfast. I cannot understand that. Surely we should be looking after our own before we look after anyone else.  One year ago, when we asked a question about the continuation of the cross-Border directive after Brexit, the Minister promised that a Bill would be introduced to ensure a bilateral arrangement between England and Ireland on travel across the Border, which in our case related to cataracts, where many people would otherwise have gone blind in the past three years. I fear that almost 2,000 people would have gone blind if we had not put in place that service. I am very proud and glad it has been so successful. Both myself and Deputy Michael Collins from west Cork got that service going and we were the first to do that. We are very worried now. It seems that political expediency is coming into this now and that Fianna Fáil and some Fine Gael Deputies are anxious to stop both us and that service. I was very disappointed in recent days to hear Deputy Colm Burke from Cork, a companion of the Minister and, like the Taoiseach, a Member from Cork, suggest that the service should be stopped at this time. Little does he know how important it is to have one's sight. The one thing my grandmother, before she went to her grave - she lived to be 97 years of age - used to pray and hope for was that she would not go “dark” as she called it. She did not want to go blind. I appeal to the Minister, as he promised us more than a year ago, to put in place legislation for a bilateral arrangement to ensure we can continue the service after 31 December. I am sad to say that when asked about this a couple of weeks ago, Deputy Micheál Martin, the Taoiseach of our country, was smirking and laughing. It is no smirking and laughing matter if one is going blind or is facing the threat of going blind. If one is roaring with pain in the middle of the night and needs a hip operation, it is not fair to be told one has to wait two or three years to get an operation in Cork or in Tralee. The Taoiseach is promising some centre in Cork but that will take two years or more, if it ever comes into being. I appeal to the members of this Government on this matter, and it is not a laughing matter. We will remind them about this every day of every week we are up here for whatever length of time we are here. If this Government is going to let people go blind on its watch we will remind it of this. If it is going to allow people to continue roaring with pain, we will remind it of that too. I appeal to the Minister in regard to this service, and I respect him for his promise a year ago, as it looks like the Taoiseach has stopped and grounded him. I ask him to stand his ground and to ensure that people in Kerry and Cork do not go blind for the want of this service we have been supplying to them for the past three years.

They have been advised today by the HSE that, as of 1 January, patients will not be accepted or cannot carry on with the cross-border directive. There are mutterings of a bilateral agreement with Northern Ireland but nothing has been forthcoming on this. Is the Taoiseach going to let people who have problems with their eyes and need cataracts removed go blind? Is he going to let the people who need hip and knee replacements continue suffering in pain? That is more or less what he has been insinuating in recent weeks. This is most unfair. Is the Taoiseach going to allow people to go blind after 1 January? That is the question I am asking him.	spk_108

At present there are no orthopaedic procedures being carried out in Tralee General Hospital unless they are emergencies due to fractures or something very urgent. People are being told that routine procedures will take four to five years and it is two years for elective procedures. Sick people cannot visit GPs or GPs cannot visit them. Consultations are mostly by phone and this system does not help the confidence of patients in terms of recovery. There are bed reductions in our community hospitals. Killarney Community Hospital closed 15 beds. Perhaps consideration should be given to opening up the single beds in the Kenmare hospital which is a new hospital that does not have wards but single rooms. St. Columbanus Home, a public nursing home, is to close 27 beds.This is impacting badly on people in the Killarney catchment area. Patients in hospitals or homes cannot have visitors, which is very hard on elderly people. We should be able to facilitate one or two family members every four or five days. I know of a family who brought their father home because they could not bear the thought of not seeing him in Tralee general hospital. More likely than not, elderly sick people do not have time on their side. The primary medical certificates required by disabled people, children and the elderly, including people who have had strokes, to adapt their car or help them to buy a modified car are not being processed. Where are all the billions been given to the HSE? If the HSE allocation was doubled, I do not believe it would or could deliver a proper service. People in Kerry cannot get the flu vaccination. Doctors have only a small number of vaccines and have to decide who needs it most. People are ringing every day for more than a month and they cannot get the vaccine. Depression and suicides have increased because of the virus. It is very clear that even before the virus Kerry did not have adequate facilities to admit patients with mental health issues. Dr. Finnerty has said that patients who have repeated admissions because of a lack of adequate facilities have to be let out and brought back in again. She calls it the revolving door of admissions. I know of one person who has been waiting in constant pain since 1 March and had a pre-operative assessment on 12 August.	spk_114

This pipe needs urgently to be replaced. That needs to be prioritised. I know, as does everyone else, that Irish Water does not have the funding.

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-11-04	dail	33	Flood Prevention Policies: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_2	I am glad to have the opportunity to talk about this very important topic. The situation is very serious. I ask the Minister of State to listen to us as we are on the ground and we know what is happening. There is nothing more horrible than when a house gets flooded and the water comes in the door or comes up the toilets, and the mess that leaves behind is never forgotten by the family it happens to. It has happened a lot in our area. I am glad that, in one instance, after several deputations, so many motions and my request to the then Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, to come to Glenflesk, he duly responded and he gave us a small amount of money, €160,000 or so, to clear the bushes on a section of that river. We were told by Tobin Consulting Engineers and by the CFRAM study that to do that work would only reduce the level of the river by 10 mm. Until then, 16 houses were being flooded and the national primary road, the N22, was being flooded. That work was carried out in 2019 and in all the floods we have had since then, even recently, no house was flooded and the road was not flooded. Nonetheless, sections of work remain to be done. The rest of the river from Gortacoosh and on to the lakes at Muckross has to be done, as well as the area coming out of the lakes and back along the river all the way to Castlemaine harbour.  I will give one example of the situation. The family at the very reputable Lake Hotel in Killarney had their premises flooded and it had to be refurbished and restored at a savage cost. Their position is still the same. The Laune river has been narrowed with bushes and with silt building up, and that work needs to be done urgently so what happened to them in 2015 and 2016 will not happen again. Kenmare, close to my own area, has been flooded, including businesses such as the Quill family business and the Horseshoe bar, and people in the square are under constant threat any time it rains. There is a fall away from this square, and issues need to be rectified, such as removing a sewer that is blocking the iron bridge. There is a fall to the bay and that work needs to be done. It is common sense. I thank the Minister of State for coming to Kenmare and listening to those located in the square, which I appreciate very much. Sneem village is being flooded and if there is any shower at all at the Inny bridge west of Waterville, that place is flooded. There are also places like Castleisland and the small rivers around it. The problem is that the local farmers and landowners are not allowed to take one spoon of silt out of the rivers, but then the town gets flooded. The main river out of Castleisland needs to be cleaned out, given it was done in the 1960s and has not been done since. Ongoing maintenance work is needed and it would not take millions to do this work. It is only common sense. There are plenty of excavators and all kinds of technical equipment for taking levels, so there should be no reason that this work is not carried out immediately. As I said, work needs to be done at White Bridge on the Flesk river near Killarney, given that a caravan park there has been destroyed on many occasions.  We then come to the small but important things. The section man on the road was keeping the inlets open and ensuring the drains were kept open, but that is not happening. This means floods are going into people's yards and in their front doors, and the road is now the river in many instances because the drains and inlets are not opened. This is very simple, common-sense work. We have no need for all these reports and assessments. It is common-sense work. If the Minister of State visited these places, he would see what needs to be done. There is surely enough equipment and manpower in the country to carry out the work.	spk_3

Will the Taoiseach provide some exemption to allow these people to drive until they have an opportunity to do their driver tests, once they have their 12 lessons done? It is very unfair on these young people. We need to give these people a chance to get out there in the world and to go to work.

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-11-04	dail	33	Finance Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_17	I have been requested to highlight an anomaly regarding wholesalers. Wholesalers to the catering industry will not qualify for any package. Even though the Government has said they will, that is not the case according to the Revenue. That is very unfair. It is possible for them to stay open, but what are they going to do without customers? They cannot live on the wind. Suppliers of fish, vegetables and meat and bakeries that were supplying hotels and restaurants are not functioning at all. Turning to carers, the extra €10 million the Government has said it would dedicate to them is not enough. It is not enough for home and respite services, because there are now no day services. We must compensate for that situation and ensure that these carers, who are already being driven into the ground, can pay for people to help them. The housing adaptation grant is a welcome part of the local authority grants system in Kerry, but we need to get more funding for it. It is intended to help people with disabilities who need to adapt their houses, but there is not enough money to go around for all the applicants. The provision of primary medical certificates for people with disabilities has been suspended since the middle of the summer. I appeal to the Minister, because people with disabilities are again stranded in their homes. I am referring to people who get strokes and elderly people who cannot move around and who need to adapt the car or buy a specially adapted car to allow them to go out of their homes for certain things. There used to be grants to help people in poor circumstances if something went wrong in their home, but that has been scrapped. That is very unfortunate, because a person with a reasonably good house might need some work to be done on it. We need more money for home helps and to keep people in their homes for as long as possible. The closure of beds in Killarney Community Hospital and in other community hospitals will have to be made up in some other way. Rooms will have to be adapted or rented in hotels to ensure that people who are sick and need attention can go into hospitals and be seen. We cannot just tell them not to get sick. When this pandemic started, the Government said that it would be different from the experience of the recession ten or 12 years ago. The Government said funding would be available at low interest rates, that work would continue and that we would work our way out of this difficulty. I am calling, therefore, for funding for infrastructural schemes such as the sewerage scheme in Kilcummin. Places such as Kenmare, Curragh, Scartaglin, Castleisland, Brosna and Caherdaniel all need work done to their sewerage systems. There is no sewerage system in Scartaglin or Curragh and we need funding to realise projects in those places. I also request funding for the Killarney bypass, because the town can be choked by traffic at times. The Ring of Kerry road also needs a special improvement grant for the stretch from Caherdaniel to Sneem and then onward to Blackwater Bridge. I am also calling for funding for group water schemes, which seem to be in trouble with new red tape and guidelines. The Government reduced the grant for treating water in wells from €2,200 to €1,000. We also need funding for rural cottages, housing maintenance, a tenant purchase scheme and broadband. When will the €3 billion to be provided over 25 years arrive? We are also bereft of mobile coverage in many parts of Kerry.	spk_195

It is clear to all of us that the Fianna Fáil leader, the Taoiseach of the country and the Fianna Fáil Deputies will bail out the Tánaiste. He will be saved by Fianna Fáil tonight. Deputies Cowen and Calleary and the former Commissioner, Phil Hogan, were not saved. The people of Ireland are wondering how there are different standards for different people. Many people would like to know who leaked the story and whether it was the Tánaiste or Dr. Ó Tuathail. There is no difference now between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. They have been together for the past five years. They brought in abortion together. They brought in the Bill championed by Shane Ross. They closed down Bord na Móna together. They are both trying to shoot down Shannon LNG. They brought in the carbon tax together. The GP service in many parts of rural Ireland, including rural Kerry, has a serious problem. When a doctor retires, it is a serious effort to get a replacement. Tonight, people cannot visit their GPs and the GPs cannot visit the people who are sick. I am sad about that and I only wish we could do something positive about it tonight. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael now have no separate identity and are joined at the hip. They have been in bed together for five years and neither will get out of that bed. The question is when will they tie the knot because they cannot fool the people for much longer. They do not have separate identities and they are the same party now in every sense of the word. It is only a matter of a short space of time before they are one party because they cannot fool the people of this country for much longer. They are backing each other up day in and day out and they do not have a different notion about anything. It is clear it will only be a short space of time before the two parties are one. The question is what they will name themselves. Will it be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or a conglomeration? What kind of baptism will there be? Their identities are gone. It is sad that there are different standards for different people. Deputies Cowen and Calleary, as well as the former Commissioner, Phil Hogan, got no chance but the Tánaiste will be saved tonight by Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach of this country.All I am sorry about is that we are not dealing with the real issues in the area of health, because people are suffering and in pain tonight.	spk_518

I thank Sinn Féin for bringing it forward. I commiserate with the people along the Shannon and in its catchment area. Members have seen television reports showing what they have suffered and endured and continue to endure, such as their homes being flooded. There is nothing more horrible than a house that is flooded. The water comes up the toilet from the sewer and all that and the house is ruined and never the same again. It is horrible to see a slatted tank full of water with cattle inside it. There may be small calves in it, paddling around in the water. That is terrible and horrible and people should not have to endure it. I agree that there have been enough studies. The time for studying is over. Action needs to be taken. There has never been as many excavators or as much technical equipment for taking levels and all that. We did not have that equipment in the past. I have been told that the River Shannon has not been properly dredged since the English did it back in the 1880s, which is very sad. There is no excuse for it. There should be no prohibition on taking silt or blockages out of the river. In County Kerry, for approximately ten years until 2018, the River Flesk flooded regularly. Fourteen homes were being flooded constantly. The N22 was being flooded. Thankfully, the former Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, came down and stood on Curreal Bridge. I thank him for coming down. He gave us €160,000 to clear the branches that were blocking the river. We were flooded out of it in late 2015 and early 2016 but the road and houses have not been flooded since the work was done. It only took three weeks of cutting branches and trees. It is a delight to pass up and down by the river now. There have been serious floods as recently as last week, but only a small bit of work is needed and that work can be done. Surely it is more important to please and appease the people whose homes, lands and businesses are being flooded than to be worried about environmentalists who do not have to endure flooding. That is the sad fact of the matter. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, who is present, might be afraid of the environmentalists, but what would the story be if the people whose homes, businesses and farms are being flooded took a court case against the State for not doing anything to help them? That is what the Government should be worried about because what is happening is not fair. The ordinary, good-living people who have done nothing wrong must be listened to. There has been a lot of talk about holding back water. CFRAM is trying to hold back water in various parts of the country, but I do not support that approach. There is a river running through Castleisland. It was cleaned out in the late 1950s and early 1960s and the place was fine for many years. Now there is a proposal to spend €5 million or €6 million to enclose a 12 acre field with a wall to hold back the water. That is rubbish. It is a waste of good money. Transport Infrastructure Ireland is proposing to raise the road in Glenflesk but the road has not flooded since the work was done on the river. All that needs to be done is to maintain the river, ensure it is kept free from blockages and let the water flow. If one has a glass of water and half fills it with sugar, what will happen? The water will come out over the top of the glass. All the Department needs to do is to clean out the pinch points and blockages. That will relieve the people who are affected by flooding and give them a chance to carry on. If a river did not flood in the past, why should it be flooding now? I am very grateful for the opportunity to contribute on the Bill. I support the people living along the Shannon and in the Shannon catchment area. They need attention. All Members will support them but we are depending on the Minister of State to get working, get machines out there and get levels taken to ensure that places will not continue to be flooded.	spk_700

This is even though not one single case happened in any mart. They obeyed the rules. Other businesses that did not break any rules feel let down as well. These are an exception.

A few years ago, I think it was the second to last Government that got rid of bedsits in Dublin. That is when the housing problem became exacerbated in the city. We did not have that problem. Bedsits, as I understand it, are or were in cities. A single man or woman rented such a place to tide him or her over, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, at a certain stage in their lives. When those people moved on and got into a family situation, they needed a bigger house. It is amazing to think that the Government is considering going backwards and building apartments that are not much bigger than butter boxes. If we are to move forward, we must improve. From reading everything and listening to everyone, I think that the Minister was against this type of living space when he was in opposition but now he is in favour of it. It is hard to understand what is going on. Different things happen when people get into government and they forget what got them there in the first place. In County Kerry, we do not have a problem with this but we have many people trying to put a roof over their own heads who are being stopped by serial objectors. I appeal to the Government to do something about these serial objectors because they have stopped many people who just wanted one thing, namely, to get planning to build a house legally for themselves and put a roof over their heads. They were not stopped by the council. Maybe the rules and regulations were tough but, in many cases, local authorities granted planning permission. However, their decisions were appealed by serial objectors, An Bord Pleanála turned them down and the people involved lost the chance of putting a roof over their heads in the places they wanted to do so. I am glad I got to say that.	spk_408

School bus operators and other bus operators are also outraged. Farmers cannot do anything without a tractor. The Minister of State knows that a farmer buys a tractor two or three times in his whole life. There is no such thing as an electric tractor and there will not be for many years. The reality is that tractors use a lot of diesel. It is fine for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to have notions about carbon tax. He has a bicycle and he is a good man on a bicycle but that is it. He will pay nothing in carbon tax. We do not want to go back to the days of horses and donkeys for farmers in rural Ireland but that is where they are being directed with the pressure that is being put on them to survive. I note that there was no talk yesterday about providing a ferryboat to take cattle to France and bypass the UK. I want to talk about couples being thrown off the housing list. If two parents with three children earn more than €33,600, they are removed from the list. In many cases, such couples are in receipt of the working family payment, which is what puts them over the threshold. In the case of the help-to-buy scheme, the cap for a single person is €50,000. That might be reasonable if it were based on net income, but many of these people are paying 50% tax. If they do not qualify for the scheme, they will not be able to buy a house.	spk_140
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-10-13	dail	33	Budget Statement 2021	dbsect_4	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this very important budget. While I welcome the €4 billion pledged to the health services, one wonders how and where it will be spent and, most important, whether we will get the beds they say we will get. I have only to start with Killarney. Instead of getting more beds in our Killarney Community Hospital or in St. Columbanus Community Hospital, we are told the bed numbers will be cut. We will see very shortly who is right and who is wrong. I hope that we do not get the reductions we have been promised. The carbon tax is a savage attack on working people. Most people who go to work in the morning drive to and from work. There is more tax on their cars and litres of diesel and petrol cost more as does motor tax. It applies right across the board to the hauliers who move everything. When the cost goes up for them, which it will have to because there is a 2.5 cent rise per litre promised along with other taxes, then hauliers will have to transfer the costs to the people whose goods they move. This is in order to survive. This is the honest truth about it. It is very unfair to hit the same people all the time. Most people on the road are already paying 50% income tax. What is the Government trying to do? Is it trying to tax the working people out of it altogether? These people employ and pay people to work for them. No one could do more harm to the motor industry than the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. He is a fine man but his policies are totally and absolutely ridiculous. Back in 2006 or 2007 he wanted people to buy diesel cars. Then a few years ago he told us to get hybrid SUVs. Now we are being told that any relief that was to be had from having a hybrid SUV will be removed. That is wrong. Consider a family with three children. To comply with safety regulations and to be able to face the gardaí on the road when being checked, one must have special seats for the three children, which will not fit into a normal saloon car. Families may need seven-seater cars in order that they can go out on a Sunday evening or to school safely and will not be stopped by gardaí and brought to account. I am not blaming the gardaí, but what is going on the motorways is absolutely ridiculous. They were blocking traffic when people were trying to go home from work. The Minister for Justice and the Government were responsible, not the Garda. It was absolutely ridiculous to stop people, hold them up and keep them waiting for up to an hour and a half on the motorway when they had families and children to attend to. It was very wrong. I welcome money promised to Irish Water. I must say here that I have a small company that at times does work for Irish Water. The sum of €44 million, however, is only a drip in the ocean and is not enough. Places such as Kilcummin, Kenmare, Rossbeigh, Scartaglin, Currow and Caherdaniel are without a treatment plant. The Castleisland water treatment plant has been waiting for 36 years for an extension to the sewerage scheme. Then we have people in here talking about the environment and worried about the environment. They do not want to talk about the sewerage systems at all. They tell us that we cannot build out into the country and that we must build in towns and villages, and yet there is no treatment plant in many of the villages and towns they talk about. Massive work is needed and money needs to be spent on it but Irish Water does not have the funds to do that. There was no mention of old age pensions. Pensioners got nothing after being locked down all the year and having to pay people to bring their messages to them. They are still locked down. They are still being advised to stay at home. What about the women's pensions? A number of years ago they were promised the rightful amount due to them. There has been no mention of the community employment supervisors and what is rightfully owed to them, or any mention of giving anything back to them. Deputy Naughten referred to broadband of which there was no mention. Many parts of our counties are seriously disadvantaged by the lack of broadband.Indeed, there is a serious lack of infrastructure for mobile phones. The mobile service is barely working at all because when the load increased, the service went down. That is what is happening in rural and even in urban Kerry. On top of that, to get a land line put in is a total impossibility. I know of a woman living on her own, miles away from everyone and she cannot get a panic button fitted to her house because she does not have a land line. No one is interested in that.  Farmers are going to pay through the nose with the carbon tax. Everything a farmer does involves diesel, petrol or fuel of one sort or another for tractors, jeeps and so on. Farmers cannot move without putting diesel in the tank but this Government has no problem in the world with hitting these people and making them pay more. There is no word about the ferry to France or of putting money towards proper infrastructure to transport cattle out of the country from 1 January next. There is no interest in or cognisance taken of the request that I and other Deputies made several times-----	spk_26

The climate changed going back through the pages of history. I will not go into that but it is a fact and it is well known. This is a savage attack on people in rural Ireland who own a car, maybe an old one, although it has been tested and is legally on the road. It is an attack on old people who have no other way of heating their homes except for oil, briquettes or coal. It is an attack on farmers who cannot stir or move around at all or do anything on their farms or land without a tractor. It is an attack on plant hire and agricultural contractors. It is an attack on hauliers and bus operators. It is trying to force people to buy electric cars. If electric cars were the real deal they are supposed to be and if they were an option, the people of Ireland and the people of rural Ireland are not fools, they would buy electric cars. However they are not a real option. There is one other thing: the battery. More carbon is produced to make and dispose of batteries and it is a danger to the people who drive them if there is an accident. These are the batteries that people objected to in wind farms, where they were stored out in the open and far away. I do not subscribe to this. I will vote-----	spk_63

I am glad to see Deputy Griffin is in the Chamber. County Kerry should not have been closed down at all, as our numbers are very low and there are many other counties that also have very low figures and which also should not have been closed. Since they have been, publicans and restaurant owners are now unable to trade. They will need support because they cannot live on the wind. There are hundreds of workers who are now unemployed this morning, when there was no need in the world for that. We all know that there is only so much in the well and the well will go dry. As I have said before, we do not have gold, oil or diamonds in this State. The only way we can keep the country going is by people working. I appeal to the Minister and the Government to ensure that these people receive a proper payment and to restore the €350 payment which was available at the start. If it was needed in March, it is needed in September, October and even more as we go into the dark winter.  Owners of pubs, restaurants and other businesses have bank loans. The banks must be brought to heel and stall their demands for repayments. I worry that many businesses will not open. Many will not open or worry that in three or four weeks' time, when they switch on their lights again that the Government will just say, ""Lads, off with ye again"". It is harder to get going in the middle of winter than in the spring or early summer when there are some visitors coming to the county. Many of these pubs will never open again after being closed now. It was hard enough to open in September and then they only had two weeks before the Government closed them again. It is absolutely ridiculous. I appeal to the Government to talk to the banks and ensure no pressure is put on these people at this time. I am very worried about mental health and the psychological effect this will have on many people, even the customers. I appeal to the Government to address these matters. "	spk_46

As we are an island nation and there may be tariffs to go through England, we must ensure that we have direct access from Ireland to mainland France by ferry or whatever to ensure that we have ample ways of getting our produce into the rest of Europe. That is very important. Cattle prices are fairly good at the present time. I have not been able to say that for the last four years while I have been up here in this House. We do not want anything to happen that would be to the detriment of farm produce, whether it is the live export trade, the beef trade or any produce from Irish farms. We must make sure. Our Government has to insist that it gets the financial support to develop this new ferry service from Ireland to France and there must be no doubt about it that we are looking for that. We must ensure that Irish produce is able to get out of this country. Also we must do everything possible to maintain the markets we have with the UK and that we have had traditionally. They are our nearest neighbours and a lot of buyers come down from the North of Ireland. We must ensure that nothing jeopardises that. They have been good buyers and we welcome them to places like Cahersiveen, Kenmare and Castleisland. They always have a positive influence on the cattle trade.	spk_195

The majority of these jobs are in rural areas. They have been badly affected as it is, without being hurt any further. The part of the country that I come from and represent has Munster Joinery Farmers and those who own SMEs are very worried at the present time because, as we know, the greater part of their work and products is being exported to the UK. They need serious help. Wonderful people work in London and elsewhere in the UK, such as Dan Tim O'Sullivan who is from the heart of south Kerry and employs over 2,500 people. Mike Jack Cronin, who is from Killarney, employs people in Killarney and London. We are very proud of him and his venture with Thermohouse insulated homes. He is making headway and has been making progress in the UK. If there is a hard Brexit, we hope it will not affect these honest and hard-working people. We are importing and exporting. Like Deputy Collins, I am very worried about the fishermen and the prospect of England taking back some of her waters. This could greatly reduce the ability of our fishermen to eke a living out of the sea. They need financial support right away. We need to invest in our ports and ferries. We are very worried about the land bridge to Europe. We must have our own facilities, mechanisms and ways to get to mainland Europe. We are a small island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The Government needs to realise that and deal with it. If we have to buy ferries and upgrade our ports, that is what we have to do. We have to ensure that our farmers and business people are not compromised. In regard to the North of Ireland, we greatly respect our interaction with it. It is part of our country. Only a ditch separates North and South and trade is going on up and down the country. We hope this is not interrupted or interfered with in any way because it would have a devastating effect on local work and business. I appeal to the Government to ensure that tariffs and customs regulations are dealt with expeditiously. Why are we leaving everything to the last day? There is too much left to do and the Government has lost a lot of time. I know the coronavirus is taking up a lot of time, but we have to delegate and make sure that these matters are properly and expeditiously dealt with.	spk_251

On the Order of Business last week, I told the Taoiseach I knew the Government was going to close them down again even though we have very small numbers in places like Kerry and along the west coast and it does not merit a closure. I and a lot of people also knew that Dublin was not going to be let open after another week because of the massive numbers. To balance the thing out, ye have all the country closed down. It is going to have massive psychological and financial repercussions for the people, publicans and the customers, as well as the rural people in general, to close them down again. What are we going to do with them? Are they going to be given financial assistance? The talk about allowing 15 customers to be served outside in the open air, seated outside somewhere, tells me that there is no comprehension at all about rural Ireland, not even the weather.

Sliabh Luachra, Nickie McAuliffe, Derry Healy, Neily O'Connor and others play music for free at events for the elderly. I had the pleasure of playing for an elderly woman the other night, Hannah O'Shea, who is 105 years old and lives on the Lewis Road in Killarney. She was absolutely delighted. I have seen music played for elderly people, some with Alzheimer's disease, in groups and have seen them tapping to the music. They might be elderly, sick and suffering but when someone plays them a few tunes they start tapping to the music. It really makes a difference. The psychological well-being and mental well-being of people is so important. We must do something for the artists who are on their knees at present and have nowhere to get funding. We must open up some avenues for them and ensure they get some social welfare payment because many of them are not getting it. I could say much more about the importance of playing music, song, dance and storytelling. All that kind of thing is so important, and I hope we do not lose it because of this pandemic.	spk_262

If we elected representatives are to be relevant at all, we must ensure we do everything possible for people, whether young or old, with physical and mental disabilities. In County Kerry at present - it is likewise around the country but we know about our own county - many day care centres that were closed because of the coronavirus are now only 30% open and that is not good enough. The parents of these children are under savage pressure. The home carers, whether they are brothers, sisters, fathers or mothers, are under pressure. I have met many of them going back many years and they are great people for seeing after their children but they are under pressure when they get over 70 years of age. I know some who are moving towards 80 and their worry is what will happen their child when they pass on or who will look after the child. We are short of respite places for these children and when the parents are getting old, they do not know what will become of their child. The coronavirus has disrupted so many families. These special children need physiotherapy, language therapy and speech therapy. They have lost all that and on top of that their parents are at home minding them 24-7 and they cannot give any time to their other children. It is very sad. We are in trouble with primary care certificates. They are not being processed. We also have issues with early intervention for children with disabilities and home carers. Home carers are not being looked after at all and we must recognise them. If these children are not getting to day care centres, their parents must be funded to provide and pay for the services themselves. 	spk_388

It gives us an opportunity to discuss this issue. Low- and medium-income families are under savage financial pressure. The cost of providing a home, by renting or otherwise, and putting food on the table is a real problem for many families. I wish to appeal to community welfare officers, who are doing very good work, to continue to look after low-income families and ensure that children have food and that all their needs are met. Some children go to school hungry in the mornings. The schools discreetly look after them and give them the opportunity to get food. That is one aspect of the matter that we, as elected representatives, should address by insisting that schools get financial assistance to provide this service for children who go into their classroom hungry. It is not a widespread problem, but it is a real problem that is happening in rural and urban schools. It is a problem that arises because money is scarce. For those who are living on the bread line, money is very tight. Whatever else happens, we must ensure that children are not left hungry. In these times, many people are eating more than they ought. I may be one of them. We must ensure that school children and other young children have enough to eat and that their needs are met. We have a duty to do so.	spk_18

I know only too well what has gone on with forestry in the past two years. It is the total height of blackguarding. I have raised this issue several times on the Order of Business and at every chance I got over the past couple of years. I could see what is happening coming. We are very near to a situation where the sawmills will close, the hauliers will stop working, the harvesters of the forests will have nothing to do and the planters will have no ground to plant on. What is going on is the height of blackguarding. People are appealing from as far away as 200 miles, with no connection at all to forestry or to the felling licence they are appealing against. What happened in the first place is that farmers and Coillte planted marginal lands and got grants to do so from the Government of the day, which was proper and right. It was marginal land that was fit for nothing else. This had the effect of creating income for the State and for the landowners and the lands were replanted. However, the whole thing has been at a standstill for the past two years and it is now coming to a head. If action is not taken, 1,200 jobs will be lost and €2 billion could be taken out of the economy. When I am in Kilgarvan, all the lorries are travelling westwards, bringing products that are costing people money. The only lorries I see going eastwards are the forestry lorries, which are creating an income for people, and the fish lorries, which we talked about last night. There are also farmers taking cattle from the Kenmare mart through the town and eastwards. If we are not careful, we will lose the forestry industry because farmers will have to decide, before planting land again, whether they will be able to fell it. They have to put up with all the nuisances such as deer, badgers and foxes that are coming out of this forestry but they cannot cut it down and realise the income to which they are rightly entitled. There are places like Clondrohid, Enniskeane, Palfab Limited, Grainger's in Clonmel and Medite in Clonmel, all of which could close down. All the lorries we see on the roads taking the timber to the sawmills will be no more. I am appealing to the Minister not to rush the Bill through and to take our amendments into account. We must be sure the legislation is adequate to deal with the blackguarding that is going on. I get very hurt and annoyed when I hear Dublin Deputies interfering and meddling in something they know nothing at all about. I appeal to the Minister to take our amendments on board.	spk_245

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-09-30	dail	33	Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_20	I will support Deputy Fitzmaurice's amendment, which seeks to provide that eight weeks would be a sufficient period in which a decision on a felling licence could be made.That is laudable and deserves praise. I do not know if that includes a stipulation that five weeks should be allowed for the appellant to make the appeal or a submission. That should be part of it as well in the same way it is for a planning application for a house or for the biggest commercial venture ever thought of. Those are the rules that the local authorities insist on in those scenarios and they have worked fine in thousands and maybe millions of applications. I have to say to Deputy Boyd Barrett that I respect him an awful lot. He does an awful lot of talking and good work but he has gone off the rails this evening and he is off the track. It is a good job that he is elected here and that he has a salary out of Dáil Éireann because if he did not, he would not make a living out of forestry anyway. I can guarantee him that because he just does not know what he is talking about. Many of the forests we are talking about are being cut down for the third time. They were planted back in the late 1940s and early 1950s, they were cut down 30 years after that and they were cut down 25 or 30 years after that again because they grow quicker the second time as there is more vegetation. It is a recognised fact that forests grow quicker the second time and even the third time. I can even point out one forest in Kilgarvan to the Deputy that has been planted three times and one little patch of it has been cut. My father worked there in the early 1950s with a spade and a shovel and that is where he learned to drive a bulldozer as well. The owners of these forests had no problem in getting the felling licences the first two times. It is only at this stage, and I am going back about two years, that these blackguards started appealing the applications for felling licences. When landowners, Coillte or whoever planted their forests and got grants for same, they should have had a fair presumption that they would be allowed to cut them down. It is wrong of anyone here, there or anywhere to suggest that the people who own those plantations would be denied the right to cut them down. There are other natural trees in different places and they are a different story altogether. These were plantations that had to be planted and fenced to get the grant. These poor people, entities, companies or whatever all have to pay their way. Deputy Boyd Barrett suggested giving the landowners funding while they are held up. Who is going to do that? This Government does not have money to pay for home help or to give elderly people the right to stay in their homes as long as they possibly can. I suppose Deputy Boyd Barrett does not know that if a person has a place planted, receives a felling licence and then cuts it down, he or she cannot reclaim the land and try to make it arable. If the person wanted to do that, the only way to do so is to plant another place of equal size. Those rules exist and Deputy Boyd Barrett need have no fear in the world about that.	spk_264

I want to educate him so that he will not delay us any further with any other raiméis because these are the facts of it. The people who planted the land in the first place should not have any need to apply for a felling licence because they planted it with the idea of cutting it down and selling it. Here we are at the stage where hauliers, harvesters, forwarders and sawmills are practically at a standstill. The Government must act now and listen to what is being put forward in these amendments. I am appealing to the Minister of State to listen to what we are saying here because it is relevant, proper and right. We are doing nothing wrong and we would not be going to the trouble of helping these people with these amendments if we did not mean well. Deputy Fitzmaurice and we in the Rural Independent Group mean well and we want this Bill to go through and to make sense. We want it to have substance so that it will mean something to the people who are looking for felling licences.	spk_266
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-09-30	dail	33	Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_20	I am absolutely gutted by the response of the Minister of State. She indicated that she will not put a time limit on felling licence applications or appeals. We are going nowhere. The Government is codding the good, hard-working people who are providing employment and creating produce. They have invested a fortune in time and money but the Government does not wish to help them. I can clearly see what the Government is at. It will not listen to any of the amendments. Time is of the essence. I point out to Deputy Boyd Barrett that there are things that can be changed and improved in the planting of forests but the Bill is about felling licences for grown timber that is ready to be cut. People's jobs are on the line. Deputy Verona Murphy pointed out that harvesters and forwarders cost €1 million per unit. There is not much to them but they cost a savage amount of money and need significant maintenance. The people who have bought these machines cannot continue paying for them if they have no work. The Deputy should be clear on that. The lorries that come through my village or through Killorglin, travelling from the Iveragh peninsula where a significant amount of grown timber is planted, will stop rolling. The figures for the cost of those vehicles have been given. To learn to drive a harvester is a three-year operation. It is not like getting a provisional licence to drive a car. A person will not be allowed to operate a harvester without having at least three years' experience because they are so intricate and involved. One needs experience to deal with the topography in which they operate. Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to Derrybrien but the problems there arose from the construction of a road and not the cutting of the trees. I am appealing again to the Minister of State. Time is of the essence but the Government does not wish to listen. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is also present. He is in government now. I also look to him to protect the farmers and landowners who have land planted in counties Donegal, Sligo, Roscommon or other places. They were advised to plant in the first place because the land was not arable and there was no other way of deriving money from it. There are now many places where the trees are ready to be cut. As I have stated in the House on several occasions, we do not have deposits of oil, gold or diamonds in this country. We must use whatever resources we have to survive. Forestry is one of the resources we have on marginal land in rural parts of Kerry and west Cork. I know these places well. I have worked in every one of them. I know that if I am doing a small job on a road, I will have to put in silt traps and silt ponds and make sure that there is no run-off. The process is perfect in that regard and the same applies to those harvesting trees. If there is a stream, they must ensure that they have a way of crossing it without even taking the wheels of the tracks through it. There are ways in which one can do that. I promise that all those things are in place. If the Minister of State has other issues with that aspect of forestry, they can be raised on another day. We will give her a hearing and if she has a sensible story or a proposal that makes sense, we will support her. We are looking for her support on felling licences for trees and forests that have been cut down once or twice before and are ready to be harvested for a third time. Nothing could be cleaner or better in terms of how they are operated. If I spilled a drop of oil on a road and an inspector came along, I would be castigated over it. When I was in that business, one had to keep a spill kit in one's machine to ensure that any spills were cleaned up straight away. That is how perfect and crystal clear these operations are now. It is not fair or right for the Minister of State to state that the Government is doing something about this situation by not caving in to our request for a timeline. There must be a timeline. There are timelines for building a house or a factory. This is the very same but it is far more serious because there is a system in place whereby a harvester cuts the wood and a forwarder picks it up. Those businesses are idling because they do not have a felling licence. A haulier collects the wood and brings it to the likes of Grainger's in Enniskeane or Medite in Clonmel and they supply places such as Palfab Limited and the pallet factory in Clondrohid. All those businesses are operating but they depend on one thing. They are asking us to ensure felling licences are granted within a reasonable timeframe. If the Government does not accede to amendment No. 1, it would be far better for Deputies to go on holidays. There was less harm being done when the Dáil was in recess than there is now. We suffered through the discussion last night on penalty points for fishermen. As I stated, the only lorries that go through Kilgarvan taking produce to the outside world are those bringing fish or timber or a few cattle to the mart. They are the only products we have. We do not have oil or gold or similar resources. These are the things we have. I am lucky to have the Minister and the Minister of State present. This is their time to grant felling licences and do something to ensure a fair licensing system is put in place but if they will not put a deadline or a timeframe in place, they can forget about it.	spk_279
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-09-30	dail	33	Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_20	I am very disappointed with the response offered by the Minister and Minister of State. It is absolutely ridiculous that they would try to sell the story to us that it will be left up to the Minister to decide when an appeal will be dealt with. We are asking for a timeline on behalf of the people involved. They are depending on us to ensure that they get fair play but it looks like the Minister and Minister of State are not going to give them that. If I understood him right, the Minister said that at a later stage, when things cool down a bit, he might put in a timeline. I am not sure whether he even said that much. What he is forgetting is that the appeals are going to keep coming. The blackguards will keep blackguarding and they are not going to stop just because the Minister says he has passed a Bill. The Bill is worthless as it stands if he does not put in a timeline. Maybe he should tell the fellows sending in appeals that until we get up and running and get a timeline in place, no more appeals will be taken. The Minister is the powers that be in this case. The Taoiseach signed a statutory instrument that will allow penalty points to be imposed on fishermen. Can he not sign another statutory instrument to the effect that no more felling licence appeals will be accepted until the backlog is cleared, the people who are waiting for licences get them and work is again going on in the normal fashion that it did until two years ago? He can then decide to resume appeals when they can be dealt with. The reality is that the Minister cannot deal with the appeals coming into his Department and he has no notion of doing so if he is not going to impose a deadline in respect of them. He should put a stop to them for now and get the Taoiseach to sign a statutory instrument to that effect. Maybe the Minister could sign it himself. The time for blackguarding is over and it is time to sort this out one way or the other. We need to stop any new appeals coming in for now to allow the backlog to be cleared. The people making the appeals are not going to stop. At the rate they are going, the whole thing will close down in one slap altogether and the Minister will be remembered forever for it. A previous Government closed the sugar factory in Mallow and it will never be forgotten that it did so. If this Government closes down the timber industry and the whole business of cutting timber, taking it to sawmills and cutting it up for roofing houses, people will not forget it. If the Government presides over that, it will take a fair hammering at some stage. Nobody knows who will survive and get through the next election. We are all trying to do our best here but I can see that the Government is not listening to us on this very serious issue. We are talking about an area of production that has been achieved on very marginal rural land that was good for absolutely nothing else. Governments gave people grants to plant the trees and it is only right that those people would presume that if they got a grant to plant them, then they should be allowed to cut down the trees. We are asking the Minister to deal with the blackguards. There may be a very small number of people who have genuine concerns and we want to assist them. However, that is not what is going on when we have fellows 200 miles away from Kerry appealing and holding up the granting of a felling licence there. That is truly wrong. There are parents who want to sell their forestry to pay for their children to go to college. I know a woman whose husband has been in a wheelchair for two years since he had a stroke. She wants to sell a bit of forestry to get the money to adapt the house for him. There are several cases like these right under our noses. The man beside me has a haulage set-up and he is depending on timber to be felled. He cannot draw it if it is not cut. There are several thousand workers right around us who are affected by this. We have very little in rural parts of Kerry but there is forestry production. It is all going to go for nothing. The Minister must do something to reduce the volume of appeals coming into the Department. The reason he gave for not putting in a deadline is not acceptable. We do not accept that it should be left up to the Minister.There are hundreds of applications going in. A Minister will not deal with those, and will not want to deal with them. It would be too onerous and complicated. The Minister must include in the Bill a deadline for deciding on appeals and block any further appeals until that is in place. Surely he has enough common sense to see that. The Government is talking about allowing a Minister to make a decision on each appeal. God help us.	spk_289

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-09-29	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I wish to start off by registering my concern at the closure of beds in Killarney Community Hospital. Its capacity has gone from 38 beds to 23 beds, a loss of 15 beds. Bed numbers at St. Columbanus public nursing home have dropped from 92 to 65, a loss of 27 beds, including bed losses on the Fuschia ward which caters for patients with dementia. These are savage cuts. A total of 42 beds have been taken out of these hospitals in Killarney and I wish to register my concern about that. What is the Government's plan in respect of people who get sick in the Killarney area? Is it telling them not to get sick? Is it telling people who are getting old and must go into a public nursing home not to get old? The Government stated it would increase bed capacity around the country but it is closing beds in Killarney. What is it going to do about this issue? How is it going to cater for people who get sick? I wish to highlight on behalf of parents and families of adult children with intellectual disabilities that they have been badly let down since the start of the virus pandemic. Very few daycare centre services are open. Some of them open for two or three hours on one day per week, but that is not good enough. A woman named Mary who lives in County Kerry has a 20-year-old son named Conor. He is a big strong boy who needs routine and was doing very well in the service he was attending but it has closed. She works in the public sector. Her husband, who works for himself, has hardly worked since March because he has been minding his intellectually impaired son. They have three other children but cannot bring them anywhere. The children must make do and get to matches and other events by themselves.They need financial assistance to hire trained people to help them out. Otherwise, many of these parents will be unable to continue under this pressure. Their mental health is suffering. It is the same with families who have a partner or husband, mother or father, with dementia. I refer to all the services of the day-care centres that the buses used to bring them to, such as Rockmount in Kilgarvan, four or five days a week. Such centres are all closed. There were wonderful highly trained people running all these places - Rathmore, Scartaglin, Castleisland and Knocknagoshel. The closure of these centres placed savage pressure on husbands and wives and sons and daughters. The Government needs to provide financial assistance for the families. We need to talk about home help. Old people who wanted to stay in their homes as long as possible are not getting the home help they should get. This is putting more pressure on our hospitals and nursing homes by not providing more home help for them to stay in their homes longer. That could happen if the services were provided for them. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to do something about these issues that I am raising.	spk_15

We read that the Government was going to provide more beds but the opposite is happening in Killarney which only has the one community hospital. Where are people who get sick or need a short period of rehabilitation after an operation in Cork or Tralee general hospital supposed to go? There has been a savage cut in Killarney. We are told that HIQA has demanded this. Where was HIQA for the last 20 years, when the same number of people were going? There have already been ward closures in the district hospital in Killarney.

No. 318 of 2020): Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_29	I thank Sinn Féin. I will support its motion because there is no question but that this is absolutely ridiculous. It is like putting the cart before the horse. If the system involved people being brought to court and being fined or given penalty points at that stage, that would be fine. This is not the case under this system. The Taoiseach has signed a statutory instrument and, if fishermen are held up on the high seas and get penalty points, no matter what they do and no matter what court they go to, those penalty points will not be removed. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is from Donegal and he understands this perhaps better than any of us. Two or three years ago his party opposed this measure. Pat the Cope Gallagher vehemently opposed it. We all supported him when he left the Chair to make the case for the fishermen. I will make the case for the fishermen along the coast of Kerry from Dingle to Cahersiveen, Renard, Kenmare and Sneem. They have a lonely and difficult job. When they fight and overcome everything else, the weather may overcome them. It is a seriously hard job. We do not have gold, oil or diamonds in this country but we have fish and we should be entitled to fish fairly and to have fair laws applied. We are all Irishmen here. I cannot understand why the last Minister and Government tried to bring this in. Deputy Michael Collins, Martin Ferris and I met the Minister, Deputy Creed, and laid out to him that we were not going to take what he was proposing. Why has the Taoiseach done this? To whom are we beholden? Is Europe putting on pressure? Will the Minister tell us what is going on because there is no reason Irishmen should get penalty points and be penalised without the chance to fight their case in a court of law? It is very wrong.  I call on Deputy Griffin and the Minister, Deputy Foley, who claim credit for everything in our county but the weather these days, to come out and do something about this and to stop it before it goes to a vote. If they vote with the Government they will blow the fishermen out of it. Will the Government cop on before it is too late and see that what it is doing is wrong? It is unfair and it is not democratic.	spk_304

In my county, we depend on small employers to a great degree. We do not have oil, gold or diamonds and if we did we would not be allowed to drill for them anyway. Small employers are struggling with rules and regulations, insurance costs, the cost of Covid rules and the reduced income and trade that most employers have at present, and many struggle to have the cash to pay employees on Friday, with payday coming around quickly. Trade and business is slow at present. As well as employees, we must stop to talk about employers too, especially small employers, and we must do as much as possible to help them because they are the people who pay the employees. We have to work hand in hand with them. People are missing such things as home help and carers. I remind Deputy Kelly that the Labour Party cut women's pensions by a third in 2012.

A young fellow who has organised a job in Cork but cannot drive there will lose the job. A young farmer who wants to go to the farmers' course in Clonakilty but is waiting for months for a driving test cannot go to Clonakilty. The same story applies to youngsters going to colleges. They cannot drive because they cannot get their driving test. The public health team's decision that school buses can only operate at 50% capacity has created pandemonium and uproar all over Kerry, in Gneeveguilla, Rathmore, Killorglin, Cahirsiveen or wherever it may be. People are stranded. Many parents were not sure were the schools going to open on 1 September and had not paid for tickets. Anyone who paid after that date is left standing at the side of the road, waiting for the new buses to come on. Before the decision was made to limit buses to 50% capacity, the Government should have ensured that double the amount of buses were going to run. That has not happened and children have been left on the side of the road in all the places I have mentioned. Deputy Murnane O'Connor mentioned the over-70s. I have known about this rule for a long time. It is hard to get drivers for school buses now. The exclusion of the over-70s is not a State rule but was brought in by Bus Éireann whereby when one reaches 70 years of age, one cannot drive a Bus Éireann or school bus. I will mention Tom O'Shea and Willie Sweeney from Kilgarvan, who would drive a bus to any part of the world and are now left behind because of this stupid rule.	spk_259

I support any means by which they can be apprehended, slowed down and got out of the scene, and I support taking their funds from them. One of the biggest issues we all have to deal with today concerns drugs and the amounts of money involved. The slaughter we hear about in this city day after day is all drug-related. We, as elected representatives, must support any laws to stop that. I have a small bit of a grudge about something I know is also affecting other Deputies and their families. The banks now consider Deputies and, indeed, councillors to be politically exposed and they ask them to sign documents in that regard. I resent being targeted in that fashion. I have the same couple of accounts for God knows how many years. Surely with all the modern equipment the bank now has, it would be able to notice any unusual transaction and notify the Garda, Criminal Assets Bureau or other relevant authority.

It is very hard for ordinary people to grasp what is going on at present. First, it is Government policy to tell us to use public transport. Then it is advertising telling us to use only 50% of it or not to use it at all if we can do so. Taxis are needed and are not being supported. Many taxis in Killarney and Tralee are not working at all; they have no work. Nightclubs are closed and there are no tourists around. They just do not have work and are at their wits’ end as to how to continue. Bills are coming in for insurance, licences and different things. Hackneys in rural places like Kilgarvan and Kenmare are vital to people who do not have cars but they are struggling to hold on to their licences. Only for the fact that some of them have some other part-time work or are part-time farmers, they would not survive at all. I am appealing to the Government to do something for them. The first and the easiest thing to do is to extend the ten-year rule to 15 years. Their cars are tested so much. Taxi and hackney drivers keep their cars well in any event. Can this ten-year rule be lifted and can taxis and hackneys be given another five years because this makes sense? Can some kind of financial support be given to them also? I know that the Government is under pressure. Every other sector is being looked after but hackneys and taxis are not. I am appealing to the Minister of State because they are a vital cog in our communities.	spk_36

Teachers gave their professional opinion on the fairest grade an individual student would achieve if he or she sat the leaving certificate exam but that professional opinion seems to have been questioned by the State Examinations Commission. A full 17% of all grades were reduced. At higher level one in five of the estimated grades was lowered. How many grades, if any, were upgraded? How was it acceptable for the State Examinations Commission to refer to students' junior certificate results to determine his or her placing at leaving certificate? This disregards three or more years of students' development and the peers process is a farce. Some students had four or five of their subjects downgraded. How can this happen?

The Minister brought in a Bill last week to deal with a small number of pubs, which he believed were not serving food with the drink they served. Six days later, he comes out and says he will open all wet pubs. What kind of lunacy are they at? Are they gone stone mad? I am glad the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, such as Deputy MacSharry, and Ministers of State, such as Deputy Rabbitte, will get a chance to vote with us because they said they were sold a pup last week. I am glad Sinn Féin will get a chance, because they voted with the Government, as they also did to reduce our speaking time. Sinn Féin said Government actions last week were nuts, just hours after voting for it. Deputy Kelly said it was bonkers and he will have a chance this evening or tomorrow, whenever the vote is, to vote against the Bill that was brought in last week.  The Government today say they will open all pubs on 21 September. I do not believe it. I am sure no pub would be left open were it not for the savage pressure put on the Government last weekend when people realised what it was after doing. It is hard to make sense of this Government. When there were fewer than ten cases a day, it would not allow the pubs to open. Now there are 320 cases a day and it can open the pubs no bother. It is hard to make sense out of that. The carry-on by the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach is disgraceful. The Tánaiste tweeted that he could not understand why pubs were closed. He closed them last March and he kept them closed in June. As Tánaiste, he did not allow them to open on 20 July, 10 August or 13 September as he promised but he is saying he will open them on 21 September. I do not believe him. He said the Bill was to follow up on a small number of rogue pubs and he told us that NPHET advised the Government that pubs serving drink should have to serve food. NPHET denies this. Did the Government think this up or was it Fáilte Ireland? I want to know and the publicans of Ireland want to know. I asked before how the virus would know whether you were having a meal with your pint or whether you were not having it at all. As for the Taoiseach, it was wrong of him to come out last Friday night and categorically deny that he wanted to know what people were eating for 28 days. The Minister for Health should not shake his head because that is what the Government parties looked for and those were the regulations they sent out to the pubs and restaurants. The Taoiseach came out on Friday night and contradicted that. It is misleading to go on like that. It is trying to mislead honest people who are trying to survive. Deputies and Ministers are saying one thing and voting the other way in this Chamber.  The people of Ireland have lost confidence in the Government. Can the Ceann Comhairle picture a man and his son on the roof of a car in Beaufort last weekend trying to watch a match from the roadside? Two more men were on the one ladder trying to see the same match. The Taoiseach promised before the holidays that he would work with the GAA to see how more people could be let into sports fields and pitches to watch games. This is the result. This Government has done more U-turns than any other in the history of the State. We are on the fourth Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in 2020. We have lost our trade portfolio at the most critical time in our history even though MEPs and officials should have special exemptions to travel back and forth from Europe similar to the Ministers for Health or Foreign Affairs and Trade. There should be some special way of dealing with all of that.  An eminent barrister, Constance Cassidy, SC, claimed that the measures put in place last week were ""ill-judged, ill-considered, ill-formulated and ill-understood, even by the very Ministers responsible for [their] introduction"". I feel she is referring to the Minister for Health because he was asked last Friday morning and he said he knew little about it. He went on the run then from five other radio stations that could not find him at all. This is what we have to put up with and I ask the Deputies who voted with the Government last week to vote against it this week."	spk_221
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-09-09	dail	33	Mental Health and Older People: Statements	dbsect_31	"I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this important matter this evening. Elderly people have been massively impacted by this virus. All those months they had to isolate or, to use the new word, ""cocoon"" at home have changed their lives utterly and many will not be the same again. I was hurt recently when the Government suggested elderly people needed to be careful. One was not sure whether it was because they were going to give the virus or get it. I resented and rejected that comment by Government. The people at home are one thing but the worst thing that happened regarding the virus was that elderly people died in nursing homes and hospitals on their own. That was the very worst part of the whole pandemic that hit this country. Elderly people like to have their families with them as they approach their last days, as has been traditional. This did not happen and I am very sorry about that. We saw on the television the other night cases of where elderly people died, were thrown into a body bag and put into a coffin while family members had to stand outside the graveyard. It was terrible. On the first day the Taoiseach, Deputy Martin, took Leaders' Questions, I had the opportunity to ask the Taoiseach to ensure families could visit their elderly relatives in nursing homes and hospitals. I am sorry to say it is not happening and if it happens on a very rare occasion, someone is wheeled out to an emergency exit door or a hallway. The elderly person who is visiting has to stay outside, whatever the elements. That is not satisfactory and we need to develop some way that either the families are tested coming in or the person in the home or hospital is tested. We have to ensure that family members visit. I have one question. Is a member of the National Public Health Emergency Team involved in producing test kits? We need to know that because the kits are a savage price and they are costing people undue-----"	spk_343
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-09-09	dail	33	Defence (Amendment) Bill 2020: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_32	I thank the Defence Forces for their massive efforts and work in their peacekeeping duties over the years. They are held in high regard all around the world. The recruitment, retention and remuneration of the members of the Defence Forces have been the subject of extensive public and parliamentary debate over many years. One of the main issues the Defence Forces members continue to face is low pay. The Defence Forces personnel are at the bottom of the public sector pay scale. The main problem is the ban on industrial action. The Army does not go on strike; that is part of its code. Much of the blame for this is laid at the door of the Department of Defence. The Department operates a policy of coming in under budget each year. It does this by keeping the number of soldiers in the Army below the desired strength and by underpaying soldiers and other members of the Defence Forces. That is wrong and needs to be addressed. In this day and age, soldiers or others working in the Defence Forces need proper pay to support their families and put food on the table. The Minister must recognise that. If the Government wants to keep the members of the Defence Forces going, it needs to pay them properly. It is as simple as that. It has been highlighted to us that sometimes soldiers have to sleep in their cars because they cannot afford to drive them home and drive back again in the morning. That is wrong and needs to be addressed. Defence Forces personnel will work and do their duties, as the personnel before them did, but they need to be paid. It is as simple as that. The Government will have to do that. We are told that more than 3,000 members of the Defence Forces left between 2014 to 2020. In the end, they will drift away completely. They are highly skilled. I know a member from Kilgarvan, Daniel Cremin, and another from Gneevgullia, Breda Sullivan. They are proud to be members of the Defence Forces but they are finding it hard to survive on the pay they are getting. I ask the Minister to address the issue. It is as simple as this: if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys. If the Government is not going to pay the people in the Defence Forces, it not going to have them. It is as simple as that.	spk_366

I thank Sinn Féin for bringing this very important topic to the floor of the Dáil, which gives us a chance to debate this very important issue. Cancer screening is so important and the fact that it was delayed or cancelled for so long means that there are people lining up for services. I understand it is the people who already have cancer who are being screened but we know the story. There is stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 and stage 4, and when a person arrives at stage 4, it is too late. CervicalCheck is so important. As that has been cancelled also, there is an overloading in the system and a serious number of women who need attention. I am glad it is the Minister of State who is on the opposite side of the House because I know there is humanity in her as a result of the way she fought for the unborn child, like myself and others. I know that she is listening to me. I appeal to her and the HSE, with which she is involved, to ensure that everything is done for these people. A cancer diagnosis can happen suddenly. I had a lady on to me yesterday looking for a medical card. She was only diagnosed yesterday. She was working last week and she went for a check. The result came back yesterday that she had cancer and would have to go for treatment and possibly an operation. She said, ""Danny, I feel fine but this is what has turned up."" If she had not been diagnosed she would have been working away and the cancer would have gone too far before anything could have been done to treat it. Regarding medical cards, an emergency medical card can be had if the GP completes the special form he has. Many of them do not even know they have that facility and complete the ordinary medical card form. However, if the doctor completes the emergency medical card form, the person will get the card in a couple of days. That is very important and it needs to be given to people."	spk_373
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-09-03	dail	33	Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Bill 2020: Committee Stage	dbsect_8	Honestly, only that I can see the Ceann Comhairle and other Deputies around the place I would have thought that I was in Russia or some other dictatorship with what is going on here and what is being proposed in this Bill. I say to Deputy Bruton that he is a wizard. After six months or more with rural pubs being closed, now he is suggesting that it is the publicans who should bring forward the rules and ideas so they can open their pubs. At the same time, he is backing legislation here to penalise pubs whenever they do open. This is what we are doing. It is absolutely ridiculous. We are shoving this down the throats of people in rural Ireland. At the same time, day by day, it seems to me that 50% of the cases of coronavirus are emanating from Dublin or the greater Dublin area. Two thirds of the pubs are open here in Dublin. Two thirds of them are still closed down in Kerry and along the west coast. These people have done nothing wrong. We are suggesting that uniformed or plain-clothes gardaí can enter a premises. It does not say whether it is a private house out in the country where people are terrified. What the Government is suggesting is that when a knock comes at the door and someone says they are a member of the Garda, and the people peep around the corner and see a fellow in plain clothes, they are supposed to let him in as the Garda has powers to come in now. When they let him in, they could find themselves corralled into a corner and the few pennies they have, wherever they are, taken from them under threat. This is opening the door for robbery and mayhem in rural Ireland. We do not even have the rules for the penalties being proposed. We do not actually know what the penalties are either but we want to give powers to the Garda. The Garda is under pressure. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has asked where the extra funding is going to come from. We do not have funding at present to pay for a few minutes more of extra home help for people who want to stay in their houses for the remainder of their days on this earth after serving their country, families and communities well. We cannot provide a few extra minutes. We cannot pay the farmers who have built buildings to regulation. They have got planning permission and dealt with 14 or 18 serious rules so that they can build buildings to prevent pollution and adhere to good practice on their farms. How many of these people have been paid the grants due to them since 2019 or 2020? We are becoming like the dictatorships in Russia and other places around the world. I heard Deputy Michael Collins raising a matter I have been made aware of as well. Fishermen are going to get penalty points for breaches of regulations without recourse to any judge or law. It is only just someone coming on board their fishing boat and giving them penalty points. They have no right or recourse to challenge these penalty points anywhere only take them and reduce the value of their asset. That is a long story but it is what is going on in this country now. I will return to the idea that publicans must now at this stage come forward and give ideas to the Government as to how they may be allowed to open their pubs.It is absolutely scandalous and shameless from a long-standing Member like Deputy Bruton that he would make such a suggestion at this stage. It is sticking publicans' noses further into the ground after they have been closed for six months. Does the Deputy know many publicans cannot pay college fees for family members or loans they have taken out? They are facing an end to the mortgage moratorium later this month. They do not know what way they will turn and we are legislating to bring them down further. What is going on here is absolutely ridiculous. I support Deputy Howlin's amendment. It is what we should do because the private home of an ordinary person is his or her castle and it should remain so. We must not give uninformed but uniformed people the right to knock on the door and seek to enter. That is totally wrong and I will not accept it at all.	spk_32

However, I have a concern with it as well in that he says it would be up to the publican to demand a court hearing. Why is the venom all being directed to the publican? For all other citizens, the Garda issues a summons and prosecutes. That is the form the law takes with every other offence. I do not see why it should be up to the publican to go to the expense of calling or demanding a court hearing. If the crime were so serious, then it should be up to gardaí, the superintendent or the Minister, who is demanding that these new laws be put in place, to organise the court hearing and give the publican or whoever it is a fair chance. They may not have the ""whereas"", by which I mean the publicans may not have the money or funding to organise or get a court sitting or hearing. It is all unclear. This legislation is totally unnecessary and draconian. What is going on here is absolutely ridiculous. It amounts to trying to suggest that publicans are guilty before we have any rules or regulations for them. I have been getting cross since I heard from Deputy Bruton earlier in the day that it was up to the publicans to come forward with rules or regulations so that they may open their pubs. Can those in Fine Gael, the party that has been in government for the past nine years, not organise the rules and regulations they want to put in place? At this late stage, after being closed for six months, they are suggesting that the publicans should put forward the rules and regulations. Shame on them. They should not be in office at all and it is time for them to get out of it if that is what they are doing to ordinary good living people who have never done anything wrong. In every group or sector in society there are people who do not adhere to the regulations and rules. Yet, by and large, publicans for the past 150 years have abided by every law and regulation. Going back over the decades there was ridiculous legislation by which publicans had to abide. Going back in history, if a person was more than three miles from a pub, he could get a drink, whereas the person who was one and a half miles away could not get a drink. There were ridiculous things like that."	spk_68

I am sorry, but I am cross with what is going on and what is being attempted in Dáil Éireann today. I am suggesting that if the crime is so serious and a garda, on the instructions of the Minister, says that the rule is broken in such a fashion, there should be a court organised immediately and the defendant, the publican in this case, should be given a chance to defend himself and to present his story as he sees it. Sometimes, when someone arrives on the scene, he may react in a different way from how he would have reacted if he was there for a half an hour or an hour beforehand or if he was there before what was deemed to be an offence occurred. This is totally and absolutely wrong. I will be supporting Deputy Howlin's amendment to the extent that I believe the whole thing is wrong. However, Deputy Howlin's suggestion that it would be up to the publican to demand a court hearing amounts to putting the cart before the horse again. I call on him to consider that.

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-09-03	dail	33	Back to School, Further and Higher Education and Special Education: Statements	dbsect_27	First, I must declare that I am a school bus operator. My family have been doing it since 1956. Since the announcement that the capacity of the buses should be reduced to 50% - I heard the Minister of State talking about transport - many children going to national schools and secondary schools cannot get their ticket to go on the bus. There is no answer to any phone call or email. Many children who applied and paid the money have not got their tickets yet and those who were entitled and applied on the basis of a medical card have not got their tickets. The buses are passing them on the way to school in rural areas. This is hurting rural areas because these children have no other way to go to school. It is as though something has happened in the Department since that announcement by the public health service, which by the way was too late. We have been asking about and highlighting what was going to happen all year and it left it until the last seven days to make this announcement. It is unfair. I am asking the Minister to go back to the Government to see what will be done tomorrow and give these children their tickets. They are entitled to go to school the same as the children in Dublin areas are. We are not denying them that right or saying they should not go to school. School inspectors are doing their very best and they can do no more. Their hands are tied. When NPHET came out, with only a week to go, and stated that the capacity of the buses should be reduced to 50%, it was wrong. It should not have done so because it was too late then. The children will have to be given tickets to go on the buses. If the children do not have tickets, the Department will not have to provide extra buses to make up the 50%. That is what the Department wants. Closing down the lines of communications is the wrong way of doing it. Emails are not working the way they used to and the children cannot get their tickets. It is a significant problem in Kerry but, as I have learned in this Chamber, it is a problem in every other county. There is some direction, which has come from high up, not to give out any more tickets and that is wronging the children of rural Ireland.	spk_208

For the record, I will be voting against this Bill because I can see that what is being put in front of us is not fair or clear. As of yet the Government has published no rules or guidelines for the opening of ""wet pubs"", as it is calling the ordinary pubs of rural Ireland. Some two thirds of the pubs in Kerry are still closed, although I am told that two thirds of the pubs in Dublin are open. It is very unfair. There are no clear rules or penalties. If the Government gets this Bill through it will victimise, penalise and criminalise good-living and hard-working publicans who have served our county and our country well since the beginning of the last century. What has happened is very unfair. We were promised that the pubs would open on 20 July. Then we were promised that they would open on 10 August. They are still not open. Looking back, it is very clear that there was never any intention of allowing them to open because no rules or guidelines for the opening of wet pubs were issued, leaked or distributed in any way. I for one will not give power to a Minister who seems to be solely infatuated with Dublin and the east coast. I will not give him the power to do whatever he likes to these hard-working and good-living people. Gardaí have enough to do without making them go into the homes of honest people. That is totally and absolutely wrong. It is also totally and absolutely wrong of the Government to think we will vote for this Bill when we do not know what the rules and the penalties will be. It is very clear that the Government is being very vague and evasive about this. Let us return to the publicans of Kerry. The virus is not spreading in the hills, glens and valleys of Kerry. Our number of cases is very low. The pubs that serve food have managed their premises very well, even though only half the pubs are open in places like Killarney. If the crowd could be spread around, there would be a smaller crowd everywhere. I do not know why the Minister cannot see the common sense in that. All of Europe, the North of Ireland and England are open but the honest and hard-working publicans of Ireland, especially rural Ireland, are not allowed to open yet. They are and always have been honest. They have dealt with every situation. Every other business is open. It is very hard for publicans to stomach the Government's insistence that rural pubs must remain closed. I must raise another issue that is not connected to this at all. A week ago the Minister for Health said that school buses could only take 50% of the school children they serve. How is this being managed now? The Department of Education and Skills is not answering phone calls or emails requesting tickets. The Government is managing this by refusing to answer these questions - let students come to school by themselves. If that is the way the Government intends to manage school transport, it is a shame and a disgrace."	spk_120

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-07-30	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_19	There is a serious jobs crisis in Kerry. I wish to raise the closure of BorgWarner in Tralee. This bombshell occurred a couple of days ago and took the workers and the town of Tralee by surprise. It was akin to the bombing of Pearl Harbour. I thank the Tánaiste for already showing an interest in this serious issue. I must explain that this amount of jobs being lost in Kerry, which has a population of 150,000, is equivalent to 2,100 or 2,200 jobs being lost in the population of 1.5 million in the greater Dublin area. If that happened here, the Taoiseach and every Minister would be out doing something about it. This is an awful blow to the areas where these workers live in Tralee, Killarney, Listowel and Killorglin. The job losses follow other job losses such as the 130 jobs in Debenhams in Tralee and almost 200 jobs in Fexco in Killorglin and Cahersiveen. Aqua Dome Tralee is to remain closed until at least next April. This has been a massive attraction and is a serious loss to business in Tralee. The move to cut three race nights from the monthly calendar by the Irish Greyhound Board and relocate them to Cork and Limerick has hurt many dog owners and will certainly hurt business in Tralee. I support the request of Ken Tobin of Tralee Chamber Alliance that Kerry be separated from Cork city when it comes to economic development as they are and have always been two separate regions and should be treated as such. I ask the Government to set up an emergency jobs task force to address the jobs crisis in Kerry and ask the relevant Minister to come down to meet the workers and stakeholders in Tralee as soon as possible. The Cahersiveen and Iveragh area has been devoid of any job creation for many years under successive Governments.From Kells station through Cahersiveen right up around the Ring of Kerry to Sneem and Kenmare is now totally dependent on a bit of farming, fishing and tourism. When the youngsters go off to college, most never return as there are no jobs to come back to. The only thing the Government has brought to Cahersiveen is asylum seekers to the unfit-for-purpose Skellig Star hotel, where we are told food and water are now being rationed. The Kerry jobs situation has been exacerbated by the Green Party's role in the programme for Government. We will no longer have Shannon LNG providing natural gas, which was to create between 350 and 500 badly needed jobs in north Kerry, even though this company has already spent €70 million of its own money and was going to fund totally the project itself. We need gas for at least 30 more years.	spk_112

The Tánaiste has said he is doing this, but I ask the Government to leave no stone unturned in getting BorgWarner or another company to use this very skilled workforce, with many years' experience, and the facility there in the production of some other components, such as ventilators to deal with the coronavirus or other needed products such as air-to-water pumps, which we are importing from Germany and Denmark at present.

Very few pubs are opened in Castleisland. Other places include Knocknagoshel and Brosna, Currow, Fieries and Ballyfinnane. So much of that entire countryside is still in lockdown, as such. There are two aspects to the issue. There are the publicans, whose doors have been shut for all these months, who were employing people and would be employing people. As has been said before, some of the publicans are over the age of 66 and they only have their pensions to pay for all the outlay they have in a public house such as electricity and insurance. Insurance bills do not go away. They are saddled with all these costs and they did not qualify for the Covid payment. All we asked is that their pension would be topped up by approximately €100 to bring it up to the €350 Covid payment, but that was refused, which was very unfair on people who were employing so many others and who add such value to the communities they serve. For the ordinary man who wanted to go for a drink or two, the nearest place they could go was to Killarney, Tralee or Kenmare and they had to have a meal when they might have just wanted to have two pints. It meant that they were away for three or four hours to have a meal and a couple of pints. That is very unfair on all those people. We should remember that mental health is very important too. Many people have gone into themselves because they cannot go out and meet people. It is not just about drink; it is about conversation, meeting people and discussing the events of the day, the week or whatever else and keeping in touch with people. They have lost all of that. I really hope the Government and the public health team give the green light to these premises to open on 10 August. We will be very concerned if that does not happen. There have been murmurs in recent days that pubs being open could adversely affect schools. I do not see any sense in that. Regarding flooding, we were very lucky to get the Flesk river cleared down as far as far as Gortahoosh, but the other half of it is still to be cleared, going into Killarney. Fleming's caravan site is prone to flooding. The Lake Hotel is also affected because the Flesk river flows out of the lake and the Laune river is blocked as far back as the Laune Bridge and the bay. This needs to be dredged and cleaned out. It cost the wonderful Huggard family a fortune and they were not covered by insurance because it has happened two or three times. I believe it cost them €2 million or €3 million to reopen the last time they were flooded. It is very unfair. If one were to fill a glass with water and put a few stones into it, the water would spill out over the top. People can talk about climate change until the cows come home but if we do not clear out the rivers, then houses and roads will be flooded and bridges will be swept away. We need to allow farmers to clean the rivers like they always did. They are stopped from doing it now because of cross-compliance and they would lose their payments. What is happening is very unfair.	spk_193

She is very fit. I saw her running to the Chamber yesterday evening and it was no bother to her at all. I will, however, be opposing and voting against this Bill because I am very worried about parts of it. This new Bill is dressed up to look as if it only deals with issues to help us deal with Covid-19. Centuries of legislation will, however, be abolished to appease vulture funds who want to evict Irish families or to take farms from farmers or property from commercial property owners. Chapter 3 relates to very important issues recently discussed in the Court of Appeal. In the judgment on Promontoria (Aran) Ltd  This Bill is going through at breakneck speed. This case was before the courts in April and this Bill was proposed on 22 July. The Government wants not only to effectively kill the decision made in the Burns case in its entirety, but to also make it even easier to present evidence from third parties in civil proceedings, which would result in a free-for-all. One will not even have to identify where one got information. According to this Bill as currently worded, it will be enough to believe it to be true. That is very wrong and very unfair. It will cause massive undue hardship for poor people who may have done nothing wrong. This Bill cannot and should not be allowed to pass in this form. It is a blatant attempt to further the cause of vulture funds and receivers in particular, who have been finding the courts a much rockier road of late. Chapter 3 needs to be amended. More properly, it should be disregarded. If we, as elected Members, let down ordinary working people, including farmers, house owners, and business people, by making it easier for vulture funds to take their property from them and sell it on, we will have abdicated our duty. As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, we all know what vultures are. The way the banks have handled this, in selling debts to vulture funds, is wrong in the first place. That is what we should be addressing. We should get rid of these funds. The banks should never have been allowed sell debts to vulture funds.	spk_296

As an elected representative for Kerry and rural people, it would be remiss of me not to support this amendment.

It would be remiss of me to neglect a farmer whose land may be taken from him. I support this amendment in order to defend any developer or landowner whose lands or factory building might be taken from him or her. There may be jobs at stake in such circumstances. It is wrong to give the vulture funds a whip hand in a court scenario and while I support the aspects of the Bill that deal with the pandemic, I am not supporting the rest of it because all those other things should receive legislative scrutiny. We all know that too many cooks spoil the broth. This legislation has been rushed together by Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party. It will not be the three parties that are blamed in the fullness of time when this becomes known as wrong legislation, it will be the Minister. An hour or so ago, I wished the Minister well in her new post. I am appealing to her to see the light of day here and assure me that the Government will insert a sunset clause and expiry date into this Bill.

As regards school transport, I am getting worried about what actions have been taken or what interaction has been had with school bus operators. I must record my interest as I own some school buses. I do not believe enough is being done to ensure social distancing, where, for example, secondary school students or national school children are to be taken from Kilgarvan into Kenmare. An awful lot of work must be done if the numbers on the buses are to be reduced because if Bus Éireann has to provide more buses, I believe it will have to tender for them. That will take time and the days are passing very quickly. I ask the Minister to address that matter.	spk_677

The community group in that parish is offering its hall or rambling house to the school, which is fully heated and is in great condition. The group owes money for its refurbishment but it has not been able to generate any funds this year as it could not fundraise. Such groups can offer halls or spaces. Obviously, they would like some remuneration for them. Would places like that be considered, given that the school is at maximum capacity at present and that social distancing may be required for the older children? There is work to be done in this area and there are other places like it as well.	spk_679

I refer to groups such as Siamsa Tíre in Tralee and people like Nicky and Anne McAuliffe, who have taught so many young musicians in Kerry. We cannot afford to lose these kinds of people. We need to see after them. There are also people like Mike Cronin and Mike Doyle who went around the whole Ring of Kerry playing music for a group of cyclists, including Derry Healy and others, which was raising funds for Gene Tangney who spent nine or ten weeks on a life support machine in Tralee hospital with coronavirus. I am talking about people who do great work like that. I will also mention Neily O'Connor, to whose music one would dance on the table. He plays sets all over Kerry. He is at a standstill. Like everyone else, he needs to put food on the table. So do Derry and Rosie Healy who play and teach music to youngsters.  There is also the matter of event centres such as the INEC, Scott's Hotel in Killarney, the Fáilte Hotel and the Dunloe Hotel. There is no music coming out of their doors now which means there is no work for our artists, including those who play the accordion, fiddle, concert flute and guitar. We need to support them in their hour of need. When people's heads are down and they have a lot of troubles and worries, these are the people who take their minds off the troubles of the day. They come out of these places feeling better and looking forward to the future. They may go in down and out but they come out changed people after a session of listening to these kinds of people.  Our tradition and our culture are very important. We must know where we came from and that the people who come after us will carry on the traditions we give them, including story-telling and other things. We need to maintain those traditions and our identity. It is very important to maintain our identity and our sense of who we were, who we are and who we will be in the future. I ask the Minister to do something for these people. They were hardly mentioned until a few days ago. We need to give them some recognition. The recognition I am talking about is a financial package.  This is needed by people such as the members of Truly Diverse, a band that plays at weddings. They are at a total standstill. They have young children and must put food on the table like everyone else. We need to look after those people. I have left out a lot of people but the Minister will have got the thrust of what I am saying. I appeal to him to do his best for these people.	spk_296

Some people who were not working between 6 and 13 March do not receive the payment and I do not believe they will. They are seasonal workers. If the lockdown had not happened for a few more weeks, they would have been covered. Bus drivers at a standstill in January and February are not being helped by the wage subsidy scheme because they were not working then. There is another part to this. People had to be working in January and February to qualify for the scheme so employers are not employing people who were not employed in January or February. There are also people who were working part-time in January and February, who will only be covered for the same number of hours by the employers if they are back at work. In many cases, they would be better off on the payment because they are only allowed to work fewer hours but they are not on the payment because they were not working between 6 and 13 of March and they were not working in January and February. I want the Minister to understand this. Bus drivers and hotel workers are all affected by this.Some hotel workers are back, but none of the bus drivers is back. Their stamps have run out or are running out and they will have nothing for the winter. Perhaps the Minister does not understand, but if one was not working from 6 March to 13 March one was not entitled to the coronavirus payment and if one was not working in the months of January and February one is not entitled to the wage subsidy. That is very unfair, so perhaps the Minister will respond.	spk_320

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-07-28	dail	33	Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_4	I am glad to get the chance to talk about this Bill. I congratulate the Minister and look forward to working with him. Knowing the approachable kind of man he is, we are at least going to be able to consult him and he will listen to us. The most important thing is that he listens to the voices of Deputies when we are relating the concerns of the constituents we represent. I welcome the extension of time provided for in the Bill. I must also declare that I am a connected person. I do not rent properties myself but I am connected to a man who is renting houses. On a point that was brought up earlier, I would be very concerned if this Bill in any way allowed vulture funds to evict people out of their houses. I hope there is nothing in the Bill to facilitate those kinds of people. Security of tenure is most important to tenants. In these troubled times when people cannot pay their way, pay all the bills and make ends meet because of losing jobs due to the dreadful virus we are still enduring, we have to extend the time. We have to protect the good tenants and the good landlords. If we do not protect the landlords, we are going to have greater demand on fewer houses. I know that many landlords are pulling out now. The one thing they keep mentioning to me is the cost of the tax. If they get €1,000 a month for a house, they have to pay back €500 in tax. That is a serious matter. If the Government could do something with the tax take it is getting from landlords, we could help to reduce the price of the houses for the tenants. Availability of houses in places like Killarney, Kenmare and Dingle in Kerry is scarce at present. The local authorities for one reason or another are building a few houses now but it is not really enough. We would have more council houses only there are so many voids and they do not have funding to repair them. Before, we used to have the tenant purchase scheme. When tenants got on their feet and had the funding or could go the route of buying the house, the council got that money and used it to repair vacant houses so that people could be put into them or they could be rented to people who were on the list. I appeal to the Minister to bring forward the tenant purchase scheme to allow county councils acquire the funding to make voids fit to live in again. The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is not appealing to many landlords. It is the option that the local authority gives so many tenants. Families with three and four children have nowhere else to go. The HAP scheme is just a hames. The tenant has to pay so much to the landlord and so much to the local authority. Then the local authority has to pay the landlord. It is such a rigmarole it takes three or four months to get a family housed. I appeal to the Minister to get rid of that scheme and bring forward an ordinary long-term lease or even a short-term lease if a landlord will only rent a property for a couple of years. I will talk more when I get another opportunity because there are certain things that can be done. I will be in discussion with the Minister practically every day.	spk_29

I congratulate the Minister on her appointment and wish her all the very best for the duration of this Dáil. I want to ensure that seasonal workers who were not working the week of 6 March will be made eligible for the coronavirus payment now. I welcome the extension of the payment for a category of people which in Kerry includes hotel workers and bus drivers. There are many of them and they have no work. Because they were not working the week of 6 March, they have been left behind. That is very unfair, and I ask the Minister to address it. Like others, I support the call for the over-66s. Many of them are publicans. They have given good employment over the years, and just because they are over 66 they have been left behind. They have insurance and utility bills and many other outstanding costs. They are trying to keep their premises and make them available like others who are over 66. The TWSS only applies to people who worked the months of January and February. In the tourism sector, many people do not work during January and February. These people are not eligible for the wage subsidy and will, therefore, be left behind by businesses because when there is no wage subsidy for them, they will not be considered for or asked to work at all. Another point about the wage subsidy, and I wish to make this very clear to the Minister, is that in the case of those who did work in January and February but for fewer hours, perhaps 15 or 20 hours, and who did that work diligently, their employers will be allowed to claim the wage subsidy only for those hours they worked, meaning they will be left behind again because the employees who worked 39 or 40 hours per week are entitled to the full rate of the wage subsidy. Those employees will be considered first, and the ones who have fewer hours will not be considered at all. Like other speakers, I wish to make a case for entertainers and musicians all around the country who worked hard to ensure people enjoyed their evenings out, whether they were traditional musicians, the ordinary ballad group that played in lounges or pubs or even the Dublin City Ramblers, who played in Kilgarvan year after year. They have been left behind. They have serious costs and they gave great enjoyment and great benefit to all those who listened to them and who look forward to listening to them again. They are not allowed to work now. I appeal to the Minister to end the embargo on those people who played in local pubs and clubs in order that they be allowed to work as soon as possible. They should also get some kind of financial assistance to keep them going in the meantime.	spk_351

There was a big announcement yesterday by the EPA about septic tanks. I believe it is targeting people who want to build single, one-off houses in the country, and to stop them from doing that. I want to talk about Kilcummin. This village has been promised a sewerage scheme since 2004. It was to start in 2008. Money was announced here in 2013 by a Labour Deputy and the job was supposed to be done last year. It was cancelled last year. I ask the Minister of State to make sure it is on a programme this year and no later than next year. I want to ask about funding for group water schemes. Kerry County Council is practically at a standstill, pushing the can down the road. One can make an application but it will go nowhere. Several groups of people such as those in Lyreacrompane, Gneeveguilla, Rathmore or other parts of Kilcummin are waiting to get approval for a group water scheme. The basic right of any householder or community is water, and many of them do not have a safe water supply at present. We have had a rates waiver scheme for many years. Where people could not pay, it was either waived or reduced. Much is happening now and I ask the Minister of State to ensure the Government compensates the local authorities, including our local authority in Kerry, because if he does not, many other services will be denied to people who are entitled to the services. I can see a problem there if the Government does not adjust and ensure it gets the funding to compensate the local authorities for the lost rates revenue they cannot get. Look at the rural publicans; they cannot even open. I ask the Minister of State to look at that.	spk_224

As I have said before, if we are to be relevant at all, we must seek to do our best for vulnerable people, young and old. I will start with the old. Home help hours have been left very short of funding in Kerry. It seems to be a battle to get half an hour or an extra quarter of an hour for older people. I am aware of one 83 year old woman whose home help application was shot down recently. She had been asked if she can get out of bed by herself and the poor woman was honest when she said she could but that there were a lot of other things she could not do. Her application for home help was shot down. Home carers have been totally forgotten about. I know of one man who has been minding his sister for the past 17 or 18 years. It is 24-7 care, for which he gets €219. He is rightfully complaining that he cannot stir or go anywhere. He is doing a massive job in minding his sister. No other person could or would do it. This man does not even know if he is putting up stamps for the contributory pension. He just does not know. I turn now to the issue of nursing homes, which I have raised before. I am very concerned that family members still cannot go into nursing homes without savage restrictions. They can barely get as far as the door or must talk through the window. This is not satisfactory. I am aware of one case where an elderly man of 90 went to see his wife in the district hospital. He had to talk to his wife in through the window. This is not good enough. There must be some way it could be done better. These older people will only confide their needs with family members. This must be addressed. We have seen what happened in the case up the country of the poor man who was neglected and died with maggots in him. The fair deal scheme has to change in the way it is brought forward. The family farm cannot be assessed; yes, the residential house but not the family farm. I cite the case of Ronan Foley, who is still in pain, and all the other people in pain who are waiting for cancer treatment or who have bowel problems or need hip replacements. We still have to take people up to Belfast for cataract procedures. One woman was told recently that she would be waiting four years to get her cataracts removed in Cork. This is not good enough. I must say to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, that I believe he is going to lose the battle with Covid-19, given what he has done in opening up travel. Should the Minister jeopardise children's chances of going back to school in September, he will pay a very high price. It does not make sense to me that people are allowed out on foreign travel to green list countries. What about the people they will meet there who have come from other places that have a strong showing of the virus? If they meet up, then people can bring back the virus here. Consider the poor man who wants to have a pint in his local village. He will never stir because it is said he is going to be the cause of increasing the virus and would cause us to lose control of it. I believe the Government has lost control with what it has done. I hope I am wrong. I believe the Government has lost considering what it has done to allow this foreign travel. The Government is beholden to the airlines and the likes of Michael O'Leary. We appreciate them in other ways but not for putting pressure on to open up the foreign travel when we are not cleared here. I put it to the Minister for Health that people have been waiting here for months for their procedures and it looks as though they will be waiting longer. The Minister must do something about that. The previous speaker said that operations could be done on Sundays as well as on weekdays. The Minister must remember that people get sick on Fridays and on Saturdays and then they must wait until Monday for consultants to come in. That day is gone. The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, must see that it is gone. People cannot organise when they will be sick. It is not fair to do this to them. Many of them are lying there in pain while such-and-such a consultant will not be in until Monday morning or maybe Monday evening. It is not good enough. The Minister must deal with that. They can do it in the North of Ireland and we can see them doing it on Sunday mornings and Sunday evenings. They are working around the clock and making use of the gear they have to ensure people are seen. The Minister will have to ensure this happens down here in the Twenty-six Counties.	spk_255

While I am grateful for the thrust of the scheme, like Deputy Mattie McGrath I am doubtful of it. The banks will be the distributors. I was once told the banks will give a person money if he or she does not need it and if he or she has a good credit rating. If a person needs money, however, the banks will not give it. That is the truth of the matter. There are many problems specific to Kerry, in respect of seasonal workers, hotel workers, bus drivers and so on. Take, for example, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, of €350. Many seasonal workers who work in hotels, drive buses or are otherwise involved in the tourism industry did not receive it because they had not been working for the week of 6 March to 13 March. If the lockdown had not come for another fortnight, all of them would have been working. Now the story about them is that their stamps have run down and they will not get jobseeker's allowance. On top of that, many of them will not qualify for the wage subsidy scheme either, because the guidelines state that applicants had to be working in January and February. Hotels, therefore, that called back their workers are not entitled to the scheme and they too are caught. I ask the Government to deal with that. If someone worked for a lower number of hours, as some people did in January and February, employers can receive the wage subsidy based only on that number of hours. I want the Government to address that. Many people over the age of 66 years who feel they have been left behind employ people. I refer to people such as publicans. One woman rang me all the way from Donegal when it was announced last weekend that pubs would not be allowed to reopen. She and her daughter run a pub. In April she turned 66 years old. She has many commitments and outstanding bills to pay, like a lot of other publicans. Many of them are older and all they get is their old age pension, which is not sufficient to pay the outstanding utility bills, whether they are for water, additional electricity or other charges that accrue. Such people were employing others. Those who are over the age of 66 should at least have been given as much as the PUP of €350. There are several other matters to consider, such as the plight of businesses in sectors such as farming and fishing. I ask the Government to consider the people involved in these sectors. There is much talk about creating jobs but we must try to retain the jobs we traditionally had and which have worked. We need to help businesses connected to farmers and fishermen. Others have been forgotten, including musicians who used to play around the counties and were paid for it and singers. These people have been left behind. We can take the likes of Siamsa Tíre in Tralee as an example. Siamsa Tíre has done wonderful work promoting youngsters between the ages of 15 to 18 and has taken them all over the world. The people involved with Siamsa Tíre got them going and recognised over the years. It has had to close and, although it needs money, it cannot fundraise. The Minister of State knows the groups that do so much work cannot fundraise so I ask the Government to consider their plight. On top of everything else that the pandemic has done to people, we do not want to lose our culture. We do not want to lose what people brought us over centuries and that they want to carry us into the future. We must recognise that. I spoke about Skellig Michael earlier and I appeal to the Government to open the island again. A part of the problem in getting it reopened is the cost of insurance for boatmen. When paying insurance, these workers used to be able to spread their payments over a longer period but now their time working has been practically halved, assuming the island will be reopened. Their premium will now be more than they can afford. I ask the Government to help people like them. It is important to consider how just that one place could affect all south Kerry. We can think of the spin-off effect if we could even get it going at a slow pace. The national park and traditional farmhouses in Killarney are closed but there is more in the area. People are struggling because when places were open during the lockdown, it cost them much more. People have not been remunerated and it is likely that those businesses will be in serious trouble. We have weathered much this year but next year we will see trouble. We are looking to the new Government to do something to help retain the jobs and businesses we have had. Many of those businesses will be in trouble next year and the banks are not the ones to save them. I appeal to the Minister of State to listen to my comments about the pubs because as what has happened in that sector is totally unfair. As I said last week, how does the virus know a person is eating a meal while drinking a pint? It is absolutely ridiculous but as the Government kept the pubs closed, it must do something about giving the owners grants rather than loans. These people have enough loans to repay. I am asking the Government to look after the publicans in rural Ireland because if it does not, some of them will never open their doors again. I mean that.	spk_347
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-07-21	dail	33	Early Years Childcare: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_29	I thank Sinn Féin, in particular Deputy Funchion, for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important subject. As we all know, our children are our future and we must try to promote and protect them at every opportunity we get. I agree fully with some of the comments that have been made. The steep costs accrued by parents for childcare places them in a vulnerable position, one that they cannot afford. It is clear that, even before the coronavirus started, many crèches were in a serious situation in terms of keeping going and providing a service. It will be much more difficult for them if they can get going again in September. We hope they can, but I fear that will be impossible for many. It is sad because the people working in those crèches were capable, properly trained and vetted and worked under strict regulations. If we do not have crèches, many mothers will not be able to return to work.People working in crèches do not get holidays. I do not know what they do. Perhaps they draw from their stamps. They are paid very low wages. This is not fair or right. We want properly trained, responsible people dealing with our children. As the saying goes, if you pay peanuts you get monkeys. I congratulate Deputies Rabbitte and O'Gorman on their appointments and I wish them the best in their new roles. We are facing a serious predicament come September if the schools do not reopen. I am very worried. If the schools were going to reopen in September a lot of the necessary measures would already be in place or being put in place. If the schools do not reopen fully, we will need to organise extra space in community halls and churches. If school buses cannot cater for all of the children on one run they will have to do another run later and work later in the evening. All of those things need to be done but I do not think anything has been done. Unlike the Labour Party Deputies, I am not criticising the new Minister for Education and Skills or political points scoring. We all remember what the Labour Party did to the mothers of Ireland who raised the current generation of people that are running the country. They cut their pensions. For all of the motions and talking done in the last Dáil they still have not got their pensions back yet. Instead of working with the new Minister, Deputies Alan Kelly and Ó Ríordáin chose to take a pot shot at her. We must work together to ensure that our schools are reopened in September. There is an awful lot of work to be done. If we cannot finish it off next week I am happy for the Dáil to sit another week because this is important. People were hurt about the rural pubs not being allowed to reopen. They are listening to hear if the schools are going to reopen fully. If they do not, many mothers and fathers will not be able to go back to work. Parents have to mind their children. If the schools do not reopen and the crèches are not operating many parents will not be able to go back to work.  The Minister and Minister of State are in government. They must collaborate and work to ensure that if schools and crèches need more money to deal with the Covid regulations they will get it. They need to be assured that they will get it. One cannot live in the wind. If these people are to provide a service they must get funding. It is clear to me that more funding is needed for the schools and crèches. It is our children and the future of Ireland we are talking about and we need to get our act together.	spk_395

I will be very brief. I am very disappointed, hurt and angry at what we are discussing here today. This Bill will put a levy and more charges on farmers and people in rural Ireland. Let us think of all the people who cannot open their doors and employ the people they were previously employing. We have no money for home help for people who are trying to stay living in their homes for as long as possible. People are dying with maggots in nursing homes and there is no investigation into what is going on. There is no talk at all about carers. They are left in the wilderness. They are caring for people in their homes who cannot go to their day care centres or anywhere else. Men and women in their 70s and 80s are trying to mind their children who have physical and mental disabilities 24-7 in their homes. At the same time, we are talking about increasing levies and putting more charges on the people of rural Ireland, after what was done to them last night and this morning, so that their doors are closed. This is absolutely shameful. This is intended to put more colourful buses in Dublin, where there is enough transport. As I stated, there is nobody on the buses, other than two or three passengers. We are being told in advertisements every night that we should not use public transport where it can be avoided. This is what is going on inside this House. This event centre is costing hundreds of thousands of euro and this is what we are talking about – increasing levies on farmers and working people who are out early in the morning with snots in their noses. This is what we are trying to do to them, drive them down through the ground. We are an absolute shame. If this is evidence of the involvement of the Green Party, and if this is the Government we are going to have to persevere with day after day it is a shame and an utter disgrace. Thank you, Acting Chairman, for allowing me to speak.	spk_212

They have waited for 17 or 18 weeks. People living in rural valleys, glens and highways do not have the wherewithal to go to bigger towns where they have to have a meal. They do not have the time or funding to do so. People used to go to their local pub for a couple of drinks. They are at their wits' end. Mental health is an issue for publicans and people who cannot get a drink and have a conversation in rural Ireland because all the doors have been closed to them. Some two-thirds of the publicans in Dublin are working. Half of the pubs in larger towns have reopened. Nothing is happening in rural Ireland.

We know the talks that are coming up are critical for all our constituents. I want the Government to spell out a clear message to the people it is dealing with in Europe. The myth is out there that farmers are getting gift cheques in the post. We want to make people realise that these cheques in the post are not gifts at all. The cheques in the post are supposed to compensate farmers for not being properly paid for their produce and to ensure the consumers of Europe get cheaper food. That is what has been happening. Many farmers are at a crossroads, especially the small suckler cowmen, the men who produce good-quality beef and the people who are up in the middle of the night calving cows and trying to keep them alive. I know what it is like. There is just a bare fraction between keeping a calf alive or it being dead at a certain time if the farmer is not there to do everything right. I appeal to the Government to see after the small farmers because they are at a crossroads. I wish the Minister of State well. He is from the same type of county and terrain as ourselves. I wish him well in whatever talks he is involved in. We need these talks to go well for the small farmers, the fishermen and the small businessmen. There is a chance to borrow money cheaply for infrastructural projects, such as sewerage schemes. There are people out there, even this morning on the radio, saying that no one should build out in the countryside and that people should be building in towns or villages. I remind the Minister of State that there is hardly a sewerage scheme in any part of Kerry. All of the existing schemes are gone beyond what they can process or deal with. There is a need for extensions and new schemes. Many villages are without any sewerage scheme at all. I refer to places such as Currow and Scartaglin. Castleisland has been waiting for an extension for 40 years.	spk_283
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-07-15	dail	33	Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Bill 2020: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_29	I am pleased to get the opportunity to ask the Minister of State a few questions. We have read and heard stories that the Germans have applied for massive amounts of money, with the interest rates at practically nil, for infrastructural projects and for any deficiencies they have in their country or economy. They have it done for many weeks. They are ahead of us. It appears to me that they are ahead of the posse. It is interesting to think that a country as financially advanced as Germany is availing of funding for several different projects. Can we look for funding for infrastructural projects such as roads, for example? The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, is from a neighbouring county. I refer to projects such as the Adare bypass and the Killarney bypass that we have been promised since 2004, 16 years ago. It has even been going on longer than that. Another project that is needed is the Kilcummin sewerage scheme. Our county is in an awful state due to the lack of sewerage schemes. Let us take Brosna, for example. One will only get permission for one house in Brosna to connect to the sewerage scheme. In Kenmare, which is a large town, likewise, one will only get permission for one house. No development is permitted because of the deficiency in the sewerage treatment system. A place such as Curra does not even have a sewerage schemes. It has fallen between several stools. The same is true of the neighbouring parish of Scartaglin. Then we hear whizz kids saying on the radio this morning that no more planning should be granted on farms or in rural areas and that everyone should be moved into villages. We do not have sewerage schemes in the villages to cater for the plan the man on the radio had early this morning. I cannot think of his name. I think he was a Mr. Gilligan. Can the Government access funding now that we badly need it for roads, sewerage schemes, water schemes and group water schemes? They are needed in several parts of Kerry where they will pay their way but the State is not able to advance their applications. I was very disappointed to hear that rural publicans are not allowed to open until 10 August.	spk_326

As I have stated several times, this proposal claims to be about national oil reserves or whatever but it is about raising carbon taxes and increasing the amount the ordinary punter will have to pay. The ordinary motorist, farmer, haulier and bus operator will have to pay more. All of those sectors will have to pay a sum to provide a shiny new fleet of electric buses for Dublin. Rural Ireland is being asked to pay for that. I should have congratulated the Minister of State and wished him well in his new post but I will not support or vote for this Bill tomorrow evening. I will vote against it. In trying to come up to the mark and obey the rules that will pertain, people are trying to make electric excavators.The fact is that they have made them already but they have to charge them all night with diesel generators. What is going on is absolutely ridiculous. There is talk about electric cars but already the price for charging them has gone up. The cost of travelling 100 km in an electric car is €3.80 compared to €5 for a small diesel car, but we must take into account the cost of an electric car. Where will people charge electric cars? Where will they plug in an electric car to recharge when it stops? There is no place to plug it in. All of these things will cost people in rural Ireland because one cannot get anywhere there without a car and farmers cannot do anything without a jeep or a tractor. The Government had better realise that. What will this do only hurt the old people, who for one reason or another cannot cut turf any longer? What has been happening is wrong. Traditionally, we cut turf all around the county of Kerry to keep ourselves warm and we will keep doing that while we can but the Green Party does not want us to do that. It is wrong to make people do things or not do things that they have been doing for generations. The Green Party is promoting public transport. In the past ten to 15 weeks, I only saw one or two people inside in the 51-seater or 52-seater buses and coaches. A massive Luas passed me the other day with only two people inside it. We are told to use public transport. That is what the Green Party is saying. At the same time, we are looking at advertisements on the television every night telling us not to use public transport, if at all possible. There is a complete contradiction there. I want the Minister of State to know something I have said several times: if we put out the lights altogether in this country and each and every one of us left, it would only make 0.13% of a difference in the worldwide context. There are other continents and big powers doing nothing at all about climate change. I wish to speak about criticism of farmers and methane gas. The scientist who argued that farmers were creating so much methane gas emissions has now come along and said that he was two thirds wrong in his estimation. The Minister of State must be honest with people about what the Government is trying to do. People rang me from around the country tonight even from as far away as Kerry and Donegal about the problems that we have in rural Ireland. Rural pubs are being denied the right to open their doors while two thirds of pubs are wide open here in Dublin. The Government is hitting rural Ireland again. This is what the Bill is all about.	spk_379
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-07-15	dail	33	Employment Rights: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_32	I thank the Social Democrats for giving us the opportunity to talk about workers. I thank all of the front-line workers who went to work at the height of the pandemic in hospitals and nursing homes. I commend all of those who went to work, including nurses, doctors, staff in canteens who bought food to patients, home helps who visited houses and tried to keep older people going, shop workers who held the fort while working behind counters to ensure people could get food and supplies and all of those who worked in the emergency services. However, some people have been left behind by the pandemic unemployment payment. If lockdown had not started for another week or two, some seasonal workers would have been paid by their employers and would have received the pandemic unemployment payment. Many of these workers are still not back at work and their stamps are nearly gone. The Minister of State was part of the Administration that introduced the payment. I ask him to deal with this matter. Many people over 66 years of age are working and have created employment. All we are asking is that their payments be increased from the current old age pension payment to €350 per week because they have bills to pay due to the employment they are in and the employment they created. Sadly, they were left behind. All of the tour buses in Kerry are lying idle and the drivers did not receive the payment.  There is an anomaly in the wage subsidy scheme that has to be addressed. It only applies to firms with employees who worked in January and February. Those who were not working are not entitled to the subsidy. Those who employed people for perhaps 20 hours a week during quiet periods cannot get any more money for them now. The Minister of State, Deputy Robert Troy, said it is the duty of the Government to get people back to work. A great opportunity was missed today when publicans in rural Ireland were denied the right to bring back their workers and open their doors. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, to tell me what those publicans did wrong. Did they add to the pandemic or virus? They did not, because their doors have been shut for 17 or 18 weeks. It is as though they are being blamed for the virus. They played no role in creating or expanding the virus. Certain things that may have happened in Dublin, where over two thirds of the pubs are open, did not happen in rural Ireland. Publicans, workers and those who would like to go to a pub and enjoy a pint or two, but cannot do so without travelling 15 or 16 miles to the nearest large town, are being discriminated against.	spk_412

I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy English, on his new post. I wish him well. I had a lot of interaction with him when he was at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. I hope we will continue to work positively on behalf of the people we represent. First, I have to declare that I am a small publican in a small rural village. Publicans around the county of Kerry, and indeed countrywide, are very concerned about comments made by the new Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin. They are wondering if pubs will be allowed to open on 20 July. In that vein, what is the difference between somebody having a meal and a pint in a restaurant and someone who comes after having his or her meal, who can only afford the price of two or three pints, and who cannot get in anywhere for a pint? That does not make sense to me. Pubs should be open now the same as restaurants-cum-pubs. They are regulated and always have been, and over the years they have provided a massive service to communities, especially rural communities. Now, sadly, they are closed, and it is in doubt whether they will open. What difference is it to have the meal in the pub or to have it before coming to the pub? It should not be any different. It only makes sense where there are lots of restaurants in urban areas or where there are crowds, and we saw there were crowds in Dublin, and people are queuing up to get in. We know that when only half of the places are open, more people will go to places that are open when they cannot got to places that are closed. People make sense of what is done, but what is being done does not help stop the coronavirus one iota. I want to talk about the VAT rate for the hotel and tourism industries, which have been calling for a reduction for many weeks and months now. The former Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, said there should be no problem in reducing it but he did not do it. I must remind him that he was the Minister of State involved in raising it from 9% to 13.5%. I call for it to be reduced to at least 5% to help these people who are on their knees. Bus operators and drivers and taxi drivers and owners are on their knees, and we need give them help. Some of them are afraid to come off the €350 pandemic unemployment payment because if they try and fail, and it is very doubtful whether they will succeed, they cannot then get back on the payment. Something needs to be done for the people who will try. I ask that the temporary wage subsidy scheme be extended to include seasonal workers who were not working in January or February. I must mention our new Minister, Deputy Cowen. His case should be closed now because he paid the price, he paid the penalty and he has said he is sorry. What I am more interested in now is what he will do as Minister with responsibility for agriculture and how he will deal with all the issues. One issue we must deal with is the fair deal scheme for farmers, because it is not fair now, and even the Bill that is proposed is not adequate. Will the Minister ensure that the value of the farm is disregarded and that the scheme will apply only to the residential house on the land, as is the case for everyone else throughout the country? The value of the farm should be disregarded. Where a young fellow values his farm at just €400,000, the sum he will have to pay under the three-year cap on the value of the farm could amount to €80,000 on top of that €400,000. I am sorry. I am eating into someone else's time.	spk_16

I am very concerned about people not being allowed into nursing homes to visit their fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters or other loved ones because in many instances those residents cannot talk about or highlight issues for themselves and they need family members to do that. I recognise that most nursing homes are positive in that regard and are doing whatever they can for the people in their nursing homes but, sadly, we see where one man was totally neglected, and one man is too many to be neglected in this country. I am asking the Taoiseach to ensure that family members or some other loved ones can go into the nursing home to check that everything is fine with the residents who cannot talk for themselves.	spk_71

We all hate the word ""eviction"". Every human being is entitled to have a roof over his or her head and this Dáil should strive to ensure that everyone has a house. For their part, 99% of landlords are good operators who treat their tenants properly but there are also rogue landlords who do not subscribe to that approach. We must remember that in many instances the State takes 50% of the rental income in tax. If something could be done on that, it would help many people. I will give an example of people who are in serious trouble. In our local authority, the income cap above which a couple with three children cannot remain on the housing list is €33,600. When people go on the family income supplement, it means they cannot survive on their income. I know couples in receipt of that payment who have been thrown off the housing list because their income exceeds the cap. That does not make sense. I have raised this matter several times, as have other Deputies. It must be looked at because these people are seriously struggling to pay their rent. Rents in Killarney have increased to €900, €1,100 and sometimes €1,200. I have even heard of rents of €1,500 being charged. People do not have that kind of money. They will not get a mortgage on an income of €33,600 or even €40,000 to put a roof over their heads. We must do something about that.  Most tenants pay their way but there are others who, regardless of their income, will not pay a penny. Those people cannot be supported. However, the large majority of tenants pay their way and we must ensure there are no evictions of those people. "	spk_144

As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has already said, when we see nothing happening in places such as Killarney, Castleisland, Dingle, Cahersiveen, the Ring of Kerry, Sneem and Kenmare it will take a massive effort to get them up and running again and they will need every help and assistance they can get. The temporary wage subsidy and the pandemic payment are being used by AIB and other banks to deprive couples of the mortgages for which they have worked so hard to put a roof over their heads. We also hear these banks state they will disallow commission payments or overtime payments. I call on the Government, the new Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to deal with these fellows. We bailed them out when they were in trouble. I hope there will be funding for the seasonal workers, bus drivers and hotel workers who did not get the pandemic payment and were left behind. Those aged over 66 who employed people were also left behind. This was wrong and I ask the Tánaiste to address it in the July stimulus package. These people were left behind. Their stamps have run out and they will not qualify for jobseeker's payments or any other benefits. This has to be addressed in the July stimulus package because they have been desperately wronged and they have been left behind. I appeal to the Tánaiste to do this.	spk_57
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-06-30	dail	33	Estimates for Public Services 2020	dbsect_5	I too wish the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, all the best in his new job. I look forward to working with him and we will certainly have a lot of things to sort out. I thank the health workers all around the country, but especially in Kerry, the people who worked in the hospitals in Tralee, Cahersiveen, Dingle, Kenmare, Killarney, and indeed, Bantry, which is very close to us and deals with many patients in our general district. I ask the Minister, as I have asked several times before, to deal with the need for expanding or reopening the beds in Kenmare and Dingle and the new promised hospital for Killarney. I want to highlight problems in the emergency department in University Hospital Kerry, Tralee, where people over 80 and 90 years of age are waiting up to 24 hours or more. There seems to be a problem with doctors in the emergency department, in that there is not enough of them or of radiologists to read X-rays and scans. People are being sent home without this happening and that is not good enough. I want to raise the issue of home help. People would like to stay much longer in their homes if they had a bit of extra home help, for which I am calling. We know about the sanitary requirements and such being followed up by HIQA. Who is monitoring the protein and nutritional value of what patients are getting in hospitals, care homes, and places where elderly people are being fed to ensure they are receiving the proper nutrition, especially where outside caterers are employed to bring in the food? We need to ensure they are getting the right type of food with the proper nutrition and protein in it. We are all here today to support the extra funding that has been allocated. We wish that it was more, because so much more is needed. I would like to ask the Minister and the Government what investigations have been done internationally into who caused this virus. It is said it was the Chinese. I ask that we follow up on that, even though people are dead and families have suffered severe pain. I think of the Cagney family in the Black Valley beyond Kenmare who have suffered so much. No money will ever compensate them, but if the Chinese are responsible for this virus, I ask the Minister and the Government to follow up on that and to ensure the people of Ireland get some compensation for what has happened here. We all know what it is costing. We do not have mines, gold, diamonds or oil. The ordinary working person will have to pay the price. If there is to be retribution, we should go after it, because what has happened to our country is not fair. Our lives and the lives of everyone we represent have been destroyed and upset.	spk_153
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-06-27	dail	33	Nomination of Taoiseach (Resumed)	dbsect_4	It is clear to me that Deputy Micheál Martin, leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, is going to be elected Taoiseach in a short while. I wish him well and wish his wife and family all the very best. I wish Deirdre Gillane, his special adviser, all the very best in her role as adviser to the Taoiseach. Even though we started out in the same party, I cannot support Deputy Martin today, because I believe our party, the Healy-Rae party, has remained close to the people who elect and who voted for us. Fianna Fáil has distanced itself from the people of rural Ireland, and that was seen again in the programme for Government Deputy Martin signed up to when he signed the death knell for Shannon LNG. That is one of the reasons I cannot vote for him today. Shannon LNG was providing its own funding and had spent up to €70 million already. It would have created 300 jobs in construction and up to perhaps 100 jobs every year after that. These people have been let down. I, too, was asked about Ronan Foley. I call on the new Taoiseach, the new Government, and the new Minister for Health to see after Ronan Foley, who was promised in January that his operation would take place in March. That has not happened. We have been waiting for 140 days for a Government, but he has been waiting in pain and suffering agony in the garden for the past 120 days since the operation was supposed to take place, and even much longer than that. I am appealing to them to let that be the end of that and to assist all the other people who have been waiting for operations and have been held up by the coronavirus. I appeal to them on that. I wish Deputy Martin all the best with his new Government. I wish the Ministers, Fine Gael, and the Green Party well. I wish them all the very best for the sake of the people of Ireland, and indeed, Kerry. I promise to provide constructive Opposition where it is needed, and I will support the Government where it provides supports for the people whom I represent. As a Member of the Thirty-third Dáil elected by the people of Kerry, I am proud to represent and I will represent them, whether it is in this new auditorium, Dáil Éireann or wherever it may be. While I am elected as a Deputy for Kerry, I promise the people of Kerry to give and do my level best and to ensure support is given to the Government where it is needed, and criticism is given where it is needed. Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the role you have played over the past four years and again in recent months, and for the impeccable manner in which you have dealt with your office.	spk_25

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-06-17	dail	33	Supporting Inclusion and Combating Racism in Ireland: Statements	dbsect_2	I will start off because Deputy Collins has a slower car than mine but he is coming now. I am glad to get the opportunity to say a few words on this topic. As we all know, there has been a lot in the media and on the television over recent weeks on the subject. My youngsters at home pointed out to me that black lives matter. We believe that all lives matter. Even the small unborn babies that we fought so hard for in this Chamber also matter. All people all around the world, whatever nationality and whatever breed or colour they are, they all matter. We all agree with that. I am glad to say that here in Ireland, by and large, we are not racist. We welcome people from all over the world and treat them the same as ourselves. Even in Killarney we have a Bangladeshi community. Many of them have been there for 20, 21 or 22 years. They are Irish citizens now. They work in the community, around the town and around the county. They are proud to be part of our community and I am glad to say that I appreciate them, their work and the contribution they make to life in Killarney and around Kerry. On the refugees that we bring in to direct provision, I have been saying for years that the system is wrong. When a whole family is in a room, and I have seen that - six beds shoved together in a room - that is not a healthy atmosphere for parents or children. They are standing on each other's toes. Maybe it is not exactly as bad as it was four or five years ago, but it is still very bad and very wrong. I am saying to the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, that we should only allow the number of refugees in here that we can care for properly. We see what is happening in Cahersiveen. I do not know if the Minister will be here the next day. I will be here and I wish him the very best in any case, but I am appealing to him. The hotel in Cahersiveen is not adequate. The hallways and rooms are too small and narrow. There is no open-air space there. It is not fair on children that they cannot hop around and do as children would do in the open air on a fine day. We have had a lot of fine days and they were cooped up or else they had to go down to the town. There were problems with that when people presented with the coronavirus in the town centre. I ask the Minister, for once and for all, to close it down. We have many schools around our county. In Ballycasheen, Killarney we have maybe 40 foreign students from different countries in that school alone. In a small school like Tahilla, at one time they had children of 13 different nationalities in that school. That was only a couple of years ago. I do not know how many are there now. What is very important, and I have to say it here today, is that I appreciate every type of religion and none. Whatever religion people have, I appreciate that, but I do not want anyone to make little of our religion, the Catholic religion. That has been happening, even by Members of this Chamber, in the previous Dáil anyway. I regret that, because I appreciate that other people have other views and other religions, and that is fine with me, but we must be allowed to carry on our tradition and the religion that we were brought up in, without fear or favour. I am asking the Members of the incoming Dáil to ensure that our religion gets the same treatment as every other religion and that our children of Catholic origin going into schools get the same treatment that other children are getting. It has turned full circle. We have to ensure that we look after our own. Sorry, I have gone into Deputy Collins's time. Thank you very much, a Cheann Comhairle.	spk_29
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-06-17	dail	33	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_4	The Minister will not have time to answer me verbally, so I ask that she write to me with the answers. First, I want to highlight the fact that Skellig Michael is closed. This has had a devastating effect on the entire locality around Ballinskelligs, The Glen, Portmagee and the entire area around Waterville and Cahersiveen. Boats and ferries licensed by the OPW are idle. Businesses are doing nothing and will do nothing even though the pubs and restaurants are supposed to open at the end of the month. I appeal to the Government to open Skellig Michael to visitors. Otherwise, the whole place will be closed and it will have a massive adverse effect. Will the Government open Killarney National Park to the jarvies? I want to highlight the fact there is much talk in the programme for Government about transport. Regarding the summer bus service, which operated twice daily from Killarney to places like Kenmare, Lauragh, Castletownbere, Glengariff and Sneem and around the Ring of Kerry, there has been an announcement today by Bus Éireann and CIÉ that it is not going to operate this summer. That is terrible for many people who look forward to that every year and it is not going to happen this year. How much of the €25 million of the Minister's budget will be allocated to Killarney National Park? The State got 26,000 acres for nothing. It stayed open during the lockdown, which meant a lot to people, but it was very costly to keep it open. I am very disappointed with Deputy Micheál Martin for what he has done to the people of north Kerry. He promised them during the election campaign that he would support Shannon LNG. He has turned now in order to become Taoiseach and to get support from the Green Party. He is going to shut it down and stop the company that has spent €70 million already on this project from spending more money, from creating 350 temporary jobs for three or four years while it was being built, and from creating 50 permanent jobs. That is what he has done to the people of north Kerry and I am very disappointed in him. It looks that the whole debate on forming the Government has been about carbon and climate change and little else is being considered except how to get the support of the Green Party and to get it on side. This programme for Government is the Green Party's programme for Government. It is not the case of the Green Party joining Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil; it is Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael joining the Green Party. That is the way it is going. Rural Ireland is now set to pay, by way of carbon tax, for new shiny electric buses for Dublin and Cork, while services in Kerry, to the rural places I mentioned, will be closed down.I refer to the ratio of spending for capital projects. I have been highlighting here the need for the Killarney bypass to be put in place so that the town will not be choked and so that tourism in the town will not be ruined. It looks like there is no mention of that project in the programme for Government. I am glad the Macroom bypass has started because if it had not been started before now it looks like it would be shut down and stopped. Where is the Adare bypass now? I am asking this incoming Government to consider what it is doing to the people of rural Ireland. It looks to me that this programme for Government will paralyse ordinary hardworking people by charging them as much as possible for carbon tax. It will drive the bag of coal up to €20 and for poor elderly people that is the only means they have for keeping themselves warm. It will drive petrol or diesel up to €2 per litre. People in rural Ireland need a reliable way of getting to work. Electric cars are not that at present. There is no place to plug them in and they will not go far enough. People have to travel long journeys to go to work. I appreciate the people who get out in the morning, travel long journeys, do a hard day's work, travel home again and do the same thing day after to day to keep bread on their tables. Those are the kind of people I support and am representing. It is fine to put €1 million per day into walkways and cycleways but they are for recreation. I do not begrudge them but we should not nail the hard-pressed people who are going to work. They are after getting a break for the last few months with the low price of diesel but sadly there were unable to go to work as there was no work to go to. It looks like they are going to be nailed by the incoming Government if it does get together. I am calling it the Green Party Government because it is not a Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael Government. Those parties are badly letting down the people who traditionally supported them over the years. They are letting the ordinary working people down, such as the farmers and the businesses that are trying to employ people. They are letting the whole lot of them down in order to get power. That is what this is about. It is like the way they turned their backs on the people of north Kerry with Shannon LNG. Deputy Micheál Martin sincerely promised in the election campaign that he would support Shannon LNG but now he is shutting it down and stopping the company that is spending its own money and not Government money. That is what has been done.	spk_79
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-06-17	dail	33	Covid-19 (Health): Statements	dbsect_5	"I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about certain issues regarding health. I put it to the Minister that the testing is not yet satisfactory. If the Minister does not have time to respond to me verbally perhaps he will respond in writing. I ask the Minister to confirm or deny that there is just one laboratory doing the testing for all the country. Is the Minister aware there are other companies supplying test kits? Even Abbott is supposed to have supplied much of its product to the United States of America. Its test kits perform the test and give a result in 15 minutes. Why can we not have something like that? We are all very thankful that the figures are down but surely if they were to rise even factionally it would be very important to test people as soon as possible and follow up with contact tracing to confine any cases that may arise and to keep it to a minimum. People who have other health problems are having serious difficulties in accessing their consultants and doctors. It is constant. We are on our phones every day trying to get people their appointments with their consultants, but it is not happening. These are people with coronary and cancer problems. They are patients looking to get hip and knee operations and who are in serious pain. People are losing their sight and going blind due to needing cataract operations. Indeed, I was told recently that when Covid-19 was beginning two patients were not seen by their consultant and were told to ""Take this"" or ""Take that"". Both of them died within a couple of days. I put it to the Minister that this is not satisfactory. This happened at the height of the virus. People who had other health problems and who tried to see their consultant were put off and it did not happen. That is very serious. We do not want any more of that to happen. As an elected representative many people raise issues with me and I have to raise them in here. Many people regret what happened with the Italians when they came here. If the teams had been allowed to play but the supporters had not been allowed to come it may not have been as bad. People feel that we exposed ourselves then. There is also the issue of people who were returning from Cheltenham. There were no checks and people regret that also. We give praise where it is due, which I have done, but I must express the disappointment of so many people who regret that those things happened and exposed so many people to the virus. The Italians had it then. I ask the Minister to do whatever it takes to open things up and get the consultants to see people, to see what the blockage is, which is serious, and to make sure people are not being denied assistance in their hour of need. Stage 2 very quickly becomes stage 3, and stage 3 very quickly becomes stage 4. That is then the end of the line. I appeal to the Minister in this regard."	spk_145
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-06-17	dail	33	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_6	"I thank the Minister for taking this debate. He referred to flooding. There has been a lot of talk over the years that climate change is the cause of rivers flooding and that it will create more havoc. I do not agree. Our rivers are flooding because they are not being cleared. As the Minister knows, farmers cannot clear rivers due to the fact they will lose their farm payments because of cross-compliance. The River Flesk is one such example in Kerry. I am very grateful to the Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, who came when I asked him to visit Glenflesk and Castleisland. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae asked him to visit other places and he met us. As a result, we got money to clear part of the Flesk. Until then, houses were being flooded. The N22, a national primary road, was flooded several times in 2015 and 2016. Since the river was cleared last year and despite there being several floods, no roads or houses were flooded. Consultants said that clearing the river would only make a difference of a few millimetres. The fact is that the river was lowered by metres. The road is not in jeopardy and the emergency services can go back and forth to hospitals in Cork and Tralee. The national primary route into Kerry is no longer flooded. I have to thank the Minister of State for agreeing to and giving us the funding to clear the river. Following several years of deputations by me, Councillor Maura Healy-Rae and the residents of the entire Flesk area to Kerry County Council, that was the result. The remainder of the Flesk needs to be cleared. The Laune between Killarney to Killorglin badly needs to be cleared. The Lake Hotel was flooded and the owner had to pay millions to repair it. I ask the Minister not to allow that to happen again. The main river in Castleisland was cleared out 60 years ago and it was grand until a few years ago. It needs to be cleared again. However, CFRAM has suggested spending millions on building a flood plain near the town to hold water. The Brogeen, Glashoreag, Gweestin and other rivers need to be cleared. When we are talking about rivers, we must talk about pollution. There is a lot of talk about the environment. People think that I do not appreciate the environment; I certainly do.I do not subscribe to this thing of climate change, but I sincerely ask this. There is no mention that I can see in the programme for Government of sewage treatment plants that need to be built where there are none in places like Kilcummin, Currow and Scartaglen. Places like Castleisland have been waiting for 40 years for an extension to the treatment plant and we are talking about pollution there during wet weather. They have to clean out the septic tanks fortnightly or monthly when there is wet weather in Castleisland. That has been going on for 40 years. Tobin Consulting has done CFRAM reports in places like Glenflesk and applicants are being denied planning permission. It is unfair because they are citing that a particular field could be flooded in 100 years or 1,000 years. The people who want to build houses for themselves will be long gone before ever a flood will come again, but if the river is kept cleared it will not flood. That is what I want to drive home to the Minister. I am very disappointed with the programme for Government - the Green Party's programme for Government. Planning permission for people in rural areas is to be denied except in towns or villages where there is public transport. We do not have public transport like people in cities have. The quadrupling of the carbon tax to €100 per tonne will have a massive adverse effect on people in rural areas who do not have the same options for transport or heating as those in urban areas. We are hearing a lot about offshore renewable energy. Why does the Government not just start with the easy things such as solar panels? Many farmers in Kerry have been granted planning permission for solar panels, but there is no scheme to pay them for their electricity at present. They have been waiting for three or four years for some planning guidelines to come that are being promised day after day but have not come. They are also waiting for the scheme to pay them for the energy that they would supply. There is a lot of talk about carbon and the people are scared of their lives about what will happen to them in the next number of years if this Government goes ahead. They are absolutely terrified. People need their cars and they need surety. They need something that is affordable and reliable. When we reach such time as the electric cars prove themselves, then people will buy them and will give them a fair chance. However, it is wrong to be forcing people down the road that they cannot drive anything except electric cars. That is the wrong way to go about it. They are talking about heating and stopping people from cutting turf. We cut turf every year and it is not an easy job. People have to cut it, turn it, foot it, stook it, bring it home, bring it into the fire and then take out the ashes. Many people are proud to do that, and they cannot afford anything else. While they are able to do it, they will do it. One elderly man said to me the other day, ""I suppose I won't be able to do it for much longer. I'll have to get oil or something else."" They are proud to do that and that is all they can afford. It is wrong to stop people from doing such things. Maybe the next generation or the generation after will not look at a bog or go there. Maybe there will be different ways at that time. It is wrong to be forcing things on people and it is wrong the way this Green programme for Government is being put out there. People are terrified of it. Deputy Donohoe is a Minister in the present Government, and it is prophesied that he will be a Minister in the next Government as well. It came out this morning that publicans can only allow a person to stay in a pub for 90 minutes. How can publicans be reasonably asked to monitor that? A fellow comes in for a pint or whatever and maybe he goes out smoking or something and there are a few around. It is not possible for someone inside in the bar to keep tabs on every fellow. After 29 June he is supposed to ask for a meal, but he will come in and sit down and the publican will show him the menu. He may say that someone else is supposed to come and join him. While he is waiting, he will have the pint and maybe have a second pint drunk before the second person comes. How are publicans and restaurants supposed to manage that? I do not have enough time, but people out there are very suspicious that there is no costing for the programme for Government. The Minister has been dealing with finance for the past four years. He cannot sell something to the people without giving the figures and facts showing where the money will come from."	spk_201

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-06-04	dail	33	Covid-19 (Taoiseach): Statements	dbsect_3	"Today we hear travel agents and airlines advertising that Spain will be opening up on 1 July. In that same vein, I call on the Taoiseach to open hotels and pubs on the same day as restaurants and cafés on 29 June and to give the tourism industry in Kerry in places such as Killarney, Dingle, Cahersiveen and right around the Ring of Kerry the chance to avail of a few weeks of tourism. We all hope the schools will go back in the last week of August so we are only talking about six to seven weeks of a window. If we do not open the hotels and pubs until 10 August the season will be over and it will be gone for this year. Many places will just not open under those circumstances. We need businesses and pubs to operate in order to create jobs and incomes. To do this, we need to adjust the 2 m limit to 1 m. The WHO, which we gave an awful lot of money to, more than €9 million, suggests that 1 m will do. The programme for Government should be about getting our economy back up and running. It seems to me that for the last number of months until this week, it has been about the climate and climate change. The fact is that our emissions are only 0.13% in the worldwide context. Most businesses and SMEs will need grants to get themselves up and running and they will need a cash injection, as they did in Germany. Bus and coach tours need guidance about seating. Yesterday, we heard from a tour operator that it is trying to sell tours for 2021 but it is not clear how many people will be allowed to sit on a 50-seater, a 30-seater or a 16-seater bus. It is not fair on these companies that they are getting no guidance. Someone somewhere should somehow be able to tell them and guide them as to what will be acceptable. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil should not block the proposed liquified natural gas, LNG, import terminal in Shannon and not cave in to the Green Party. This project does not need any money from the Government, it would create many jobs and we need a second gas source. The Government still has not addressed the need for Covid payments for seasonal workers or people over the age of 66, who really need whatever they were on to be brought up to the value of the Covid payment. They were not looking for the payment on top of what they were getting but rather the €350 just to bring them up to €350. Farmers are not getting much encouragement or assistance. The Taoiseach advised us to cut down on eating meat. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, says that we cannot stay farming like our fathers did, even though everyone on my side of the country recognises that the Minister's father, Donal Creed, God be good to him, was a fierce farmer and landed up here one morning after milking his cows and the place was still not open. The Greens just want to sow seeds in south-facing window boxes. They say we should not cut turf. Some other geniuses are saying we must block drains and make land useless after all the hard work on it, some of which was grant-aided. The Greens, we now hear, want no more planning in rural areas, only towns. They want to build lay-bys and no more roads. We had plenty of lay-bys in Kerry and they were grand for lorry drivers to pull into in order to have their rest breaks, but they were closed and blocked because it was felt Travellers would camp there. I was very disappointed when Deputy Micheál Martin stated on ""The Late Late Show"" that farmers would have to diversify and plant forestry. Planting forestry does not provide an acceptable income for many farmers. Around east Cork and north Kerry, we have great land. We are not allowed plant marginal land. It is not grant-aided. We have to plant good land. Planting forestry while the rainforests in South America are cut down and beef is brought into Europe is not an option for Irish farmers, and it is not acceptable to come out with such a statement. I am really disappointed in the leader of Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach and his entire Government for the non-assistance they have given farmers over the past four and half years."	spk_24
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-06-04	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education and Skills): Statements	dbsect_4	I thank the Minister for being engaged and responding as best he can to every query. He seems to be on top of everything. For my part, I emphasise that schools need to know as soon as possible what the picture will look like at the beginning or September or in late August. There is going to be a massive difference. Are we going to reduce the rule to 1 m as opposed to the 2 m we have at present? We need to know what it is going to look like because people are worrying that if it is still 2 m distancing, all classes will not be entertained in school on the one day like they used to be. That needs to be clarified. The Minister might not be able to say next Friday whether the 1 m or 2 m rule will apply, but surely he should be able to say that it will look like this with the 2 m rule and like that with a 1 m rule. We need to know, as do teachers, schools and management because they will need more room. Room is available in community halls in places like Gneevgullia, where there is a local community group that has a lovely hall. It is called a teach fáilte and is only a step away from the school, which is already overcrowded. We need time to interact and to see how those matters can be resolved. Regarding school buses, we need to know how many children will be allowed to sit in a 30-seat bus and what the story will be. Surely someone somewhere will be able to define how many each type and size of bus - large, medium or small - can take. We need to know those kinds of things, as does Bus Éireann. We need to get out there and let the private contractors and Bus Éireann know. That has to be known, sooner rather than later. I thank the Minister for his work on special needs education. We asked him to include children with Down's syndrome and I hope they will be afforded the July provision as well and that it will be one to one rather than online or anything like that because that is not sufficient. Parents of special needs children have had a really tough time for the past three months.Some have two children, which is double the effect. We need to know what is going to happen because if children have to stay at home for days their social development will be compromised. It has already been compromised by the fact that they have not met each other in schools for the past three months. I appeal to the Minister to do what he can to open up the schools and let people know what the picture is going to be like. The Minister can respond in writing if he cannot answer all my questions now. I thank him.	spk_95
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-06-04	dail	33	Covid-19 (Health): Statements	dbsect_5	"I need to talk to the Minister again about nursing homes. I asked him on the last occasion when I was in the House for questions to open up the nursing homes to family members so they can visit their elderly parents or relatives in a controlled fashion. The situation is becoming clearer. The worst aspect of the whole pandemic was that elderly people, after having spent all their lives working for their families, working for their communities and working for our country, had to die alone, with nobody holding their hand or able to talk to them for a few minutes. I think that was the saddest and the worst part of the whole virus. I am asking the Minister to open up the nursing homes to allow relatives to visit in a controlled fashion and to give them access. I know of elderly people who are asking their daughters and their sons, ""Why are you not coming to visit me?"" I ask the Minister this again. With regard to Cahersiveen and the refugee and asylum centre that was opened there, it has become clearer that the HSE did not give the approval for this centre. Is the Minister satisfied that the well-being of the people of Cahersiveen and of the residents is not being compromised? I ask him to please check it out and make sure. I ask him again to move those people out of there. They want to get out of there themselves and the people of Cahersiveen are not happy, so I ask the Minister again to do that.  On testing, which Deputy Naughten raised earlier, it is clear that the testing being done is taking too long and there are too many delays.It is well over 20 days before some people get notified. This is not satisfactory. One cannot have efficient contact tracing when it has been going on for that long. The Minister needs to address this. I ask the Minister, and I also asked the Taoiseach today, to reduce the distancing requirement from 2 m to 1 m. We will not kick start our economy or get our local economies going again if we do not do this. The World Health Organization, WHO, has suggested that 1 m will do. Why do we have to maintain the 2 m? We need to give hotels, pubs and the hospitality industry in Kerry a chance to get going. Spain is opening up for tourism on 1 July and if we do not allow our industry to open their doors on 29 June they will clean this country out. People who have given their lives and their fortunes and who put the whole of their efforts into the tourism industry will not get going this year. The Minister for Health is a member of the Government and is a very important part of the Cabinet. I ask the Minister to ensure the well-being of those people who gave so much to tourism in Kerry and around the country, including west Cork and Clare and all the other places. This is our one chance to open up tourism for domestic holiday makers because they have only those six or seven weeks. After 15 August families will be going home to get ready to go back to school. If Spain is opening up, and we are all under the one sky, then why can we not help our people and allow them to open their doors to get economic activity going? We need income and we need the benefit of the income from these places to trigger and kick start our economy. I appeal to the Minister as a member of the Government to do his best to ensure this. If the WHO has said that 1 m will do, why do we have to have a 2 m distance? That is my question. I am eating into Deputy Collins's time. I thank the Minister."	spk_190
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-06-04	dail	33	Covid-19 (Justice and Equality): Statements	dbsect_6	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I thank the many gardaí, male and female, throughout this country who uphold law and order and carry out their duties, largely unarmed, in dangerous situations where they come across villains, thugs, drug lords and others involved in serious crime. I thank them for all that they do locally to help the elderly and people living alone and, in particular, for apprehending the villains that attack and rob those individuals in their homes. I sincerely thank each and every garda for his or her efforts in that regard. I also thank gardaí for their work to help control the virus. They are to be commended for their response to the call to control the virus. I was not here when the session commenced but I heard the Minister mention inspections of direct provision centres and state that many of them are unsuitable. I have always maintained that Cahersiveen direct provision centre is not suitable. It was pointed out to me that the rooms, hallways and communal spaces are too small to accommodate the refugees located there, some of whom contracted the virus. This morning, the Taoiseach spoke about reducing the €350 payment for part-time workers. I am calling on the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, as a member of the Government, to ensure that this does not happen. I am of the view that what is proposed is a calculated attack on hotel workers, particularly those on the X's and O's who work two, three and four days per week. These are not people who worked part-time by choice; they are the people who helped to keep hotels open and ticking over in the winter months and at quiet times. There should be no cut in the payment for workers to whom I refer. As already stated, they were working to keep the hotels open. I ask the Minister to ensure this is taken into account when the matter is again being discussed at Cabinet. These people want to work. Restaurants and cafés will reopen on 29 June. I am calling on the Government to allow hotels, pubs and the tourism sector to open on that date as well. Spain and Italy are opening up again. The crisis was far worse in those countries than it was here. We need to get this country moving again and open it up to the people.We must ensure all the people in Ireland, at least those in the Twenty-six Counties and even those in the Thirty-two Counties, can go to the local attractions in places like Killarney, Dingle, Cahersiveen, Kenmare, Ballybunion and Ballyheigue, as well as places in other counties. We must ensure people who are cooped up in apartments in cities and urban places get the chance to go down the country and have some bit of a summer for four or five weeks. We must give the people who own these pubs and hotels the chance to open their doors, have faith in the ventures they have worked so hard to put together, and give them a bit of chance to have some bit of a summer, because if we wait until 10 August we can forget about it. The chance will be gone by then because that is only a week before the children go back to school. I am asking the Ministers to get together, open up the country and let the people get back working.	spk_245
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-05-27	dail	33	Covid-19 (Taoiseach): Statements	dbsect_7	I would be very grateful if the Taoiseach would respond to me in writing because I have too many things to highlight. There are many reports and surveys indicating that Kerry will be worse affected by the pandemic than any other county in the country. Indeed, I do not need to see any of those reports because I know of it first hand. We see that there is nothing at all happening in towns like Killarney, Dingle, Cahersiveen and Castleisland. In relation to seasonal workers, it is very unfair that they were not recognised. If the lockdown had not happened for another two weeks, all of them would have been back and would now be getting the Covid-19 payment. Bus workers, hotel workers and many others have concerns. Indeed, in the past two days, I have had over 700 emails from bus drivers and others concerned about the transport industry in Kerry. It is shambolic the way they have been treated. We are seeing yards of buses, none of which are moving, and there is no payment for any driver. Their stamps are gone and they have been totally left behind. I am asking the Taoiseach to address that matter. My next question concerns the social distancing requirement and whether it should be 1 m or 2 m. In order to get going and give some kind of assistance to the tourism industry, I am asking the Taoiseach to reduce it to 1 m. Other countries, like France, Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland, have all applied the 1 m restriction. The World Health Organization, WHO, to which the Government lately gave €9 million for its advice and assistance, is recommending distancing of 1 m or more. One metre is sufficient in rural places. If we do not apply that smaller distancing requirement, and the longer we leave businesses in the hotel and tourism industry without releasing them and allowing them to get going and avail of the national tourists who come down from Dublin and all around the country to towns like Killarney and other places in Kerry, the less hope there is of those businesses ever again opening. That is probably what will happen. I have a question regarding the young drivers waiting for a driving test.Is it possible to give them a temporary amnesty? There are thousands of them. If the Taoiseach cannot do that, surely the schools of motoring or the driving instructors could be asked to put a division between the instructor and the learner driver to allow the learner to do the lessons or the test. After the lessons are completed, and most of the learners have completed them, they could be allowed to do the test in the driving instructor's car. I am glad other Deputies raised the issue of funerals and churches. I sympathise with all the people and families who have lost loved ones during the pandemic and who did not have a proper funeral. It makes no sense that only ten people can go into the massive cathedral in Killarney. There should be some other way of deciding. I would support it being looked at again. With regard to nursing homes, I call on the Taoiseach to explain to the people of Ireland why people who toiled and worked so hard all their lives had to die alone with no member of their families with them. As somebody who lost someone very dear to me in the last few years, I know what it means for the person who is dying. Those people surely could not understand why there was nobody with them. I also call on the Taoiseach to look at what has happened with the direct provision centre in Cahersiveen, all the inconsistencies and the things that should have happened. It is clear now that the opening of a direct provision centre there should never have happened. The HSE did not agree with it, the people of Cahersiveen did not agree with it and the residents in the direct provision centre do not agree with it. I ask the Taoiseach to examine this, to close it down for once and for all and to give the people of Cahersiveen and the residents fair play.	spk_154
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-05-27	dail	33	Covid-19 (Health): Statements	dbsect_9	I am glad to have the opportunity to raise some issues. The thing that hurt me and many others the most, which I raised earlier with the Taoiseach, is that people died in nursing homes and hospitals without any family member being with them. I do not know who made that decision. We must go forward. The Government did several things right but there were a number of things that were not done right and this is one of them.This is one thing I feel should not have happened. My own father died five years ago but I can remember every one of the last hours and minutes that I was with him. If I was denied being able to be with that man after all the years, or thought that nobody was with him, it would break my heart forever. I might as well be dead as well. I feel for all the families that went through this. I ask the Minister to devise a way to let people in to see their family members who are in nursing homes. I have been asked about that several times, including this morning and yesterday. What benefit is there in stopping people from visiting their mother or father? I had another person contact me after lunch today on the same matter. I ask the Minister to review the situation. Discussions are going on to assess the benefit of that approach. I do not think it was of any benefit. Visiting could have been allowed in a controlled fashion for five, ten or 15 minutes. That would have kept many people happy. I want to go forward. We must try to scramble out of the place we are in now to get back to where we were. We pay a lot of money to the WHO, which says that 1 m social distancing is sufficient. If the Government does not follow that recommendation, many places will not go back to where they were. Many hotels, restaurants and pubs will not open because it is not possible to manage a distance of 2 m in small places. Rural places are different. We are told that this pandemic is affecting and will affect rural places more than urban locations such as cities and bigger towns. I heard the Taoiseach say home care packages could be the way to go. No one asked for an increase in home help hours more than I did in the previous Dáil. Day after day I asked for it because I know that people really want to spend as long as possible, or even the last days of their lives, in their own homes. I was glad to hear the Taoiseach say that might be the way to go or that he was considering doing that but the fact is that at the height of the pandemic he cut the home help to many people. I am sorry about that. Many of those who worked in the home help area did not get another job. Perhaps they were being kept back in case they were needed, but the fact is that it did not happen, and many people were left without their home help. I ask the Minister to restore the home help that was taken from people and to increase the home care packages so that people can remain longer in their homes and have the same people dealing with them. If that happened, they would not have to go into nursing homes or hospitals. I ask the Minister to ensure that happens. Testing is not sufficient. A man got out of his bed at 4 a.m. last Sunday morning and finished up in a hospital. The doctor said he should be tested but some other official came along and said he could not be tested because he was not being admitted. That is not an adequate response. Many people were in touch with me to help them get the Covid payment but yesterday and the day before two people contacted me who are trying to get off it. They must go online to do it but they have no broadband. They tried to make calls and were kept waiting at the end of the telephone line. They are like the two fellows who were stuck on the train who wanted to get off at Mallow. They finished up in Cork because the train was going direct to Cork. I am sorry, I have gone into my colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath's, time.	spk_268
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-05-27	dail	33	Covid-19 (Local Government): Statements	dbsect_10	I thank my local authority, Kerry County Council, its management and workers for the great work they have been doing continually during this virus. I thank Radio Kerry, the Garda and all the voluntary workers around the county who have done tremendous work for people cocooning and those who are very isolated. It is only now that we realise the value of businesses and employers. I have mentioned several times here that Friday evening is not long coming when someone has a team of men or women to pay. These are the very people who are paying for each and every one of us here. Consider what happens when they stop working. We see now there are no rates. There has been a lot of commotion over extending the three-month waiver in respect of the rates but in Kerry County Council there has always been a waiver system or reduction system for those not working or whose turnover is reduced, no thanks to the current Government. The question is whether the Government will replenish the money that would normally come in from the businesses to keep the services going.Does the Minister of State or his Department have anything to do with the cut to the travel allowance for workers in our local authority? It is very wrong to cut the travel allowance of these people, who are under a lot of pressure to keep services going. Temporary workers have also been told that their contracts will not be renewed even though some have been working for the local authority for two or three years. That is not fair or right. They threw their lot in with the local authority. We are going to have reduced services if we have a reduced workforce. On infrastructural projects, we have been promised that we will work our way out of this financial problem. I appeal to the Government to keep infrastructural projects that are ready to go, such as road and water schemes, on track and to keep them going. I ask the Government to ensure that the roads programme is not cut because, as Deputy Mattie McGrath said with regard to local improvement schemes and community involvement schemes, people in rural Ireland, including in Kerry, are every bit as entitled to good roads to their doors as people in Dublin 4. With regard to planning in rural areas, perhaps the powers that be will now realise the value of people living in rural Ireland. They are isolated from these kinds of viruses. Perhaps we will now appreciate the value of people living in rural Ireland instead of living on top of one another here in Dublin. With regard to rural cottages and demountable homes, the previous Government certainly let rural Ireland down. For the period 2016 to 2021, 13 rural cottages are to be built in Kerry even though there are almost 70 people on a list who wish to build houses on their own land, possibly their farms, to be near their own people. We have had only one demountable home sited in the past three years. When a house in which an elderly man lived fell into disrepair, the local authority used to bring in a demountable home in which he could remain until the end of his days.  Applicants are being excluded from the housing list. Perhaps that is how the Government is reducing the numbers on it. When a couple with three children begins to earn more than €33,600, they are thrown off the list. Who could buy a house or get a mortgage on that income? It is totally unacceptable. I ask the Government to keep the Killarney bypass progressing on track. I ask that the doors of the local authority buildings that supply and deliver services be opened as soon as possible. When the bank and shop on a street is open, what difference would it make to open the doors of the local authority in order to bring normality back to our country?	spk_418
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-05-27	dail	33	Covid-19 (Communications, Climate Action and Environment): Statements	dbsect_12	I too thank An Post for the great service it has given, and is still giving, right around the country. I hope that no more post offices will be closed down. I thank the local broadcasters, especially Radio Kerry. I also thank the local journalists. I wish to highlight that there has been difficulty accessing Zoom meetings. It has been explained to me that it is a problem right around the country. It is not fair that people cannot link in. Remote working is the order of the day but in Kerry it is hardly possible at all because of the number of places that are without broadband coverage. As I explained to the Minister previously, there are pockets of coverage. There is fibre passing outside one man's gate who urgently needs it but there is no break in the line of fibre and the black box that is required is some 400 m or 500 m up the road. A black box covers 11 houses. We are told by Eir that National Broadband Ireland is going to do it and will be paid for it so Eir will not do it. There are pockets between Doocarrig and Beheenagh, between Gneevgullia and Kilcummin, Reaboy and Tooreencahill where various places have been left out. Children and farmers are expected to go online. This year, farmers were told they had to submit their single farm payment applications online. This was very tough on those who had to get someone else to do it for them. It is not fair that they had to do that. Every minute of every day, someone is talking about climate and climate change. The one thing we are clear and sure on now is that it is not the farmer who is to blame.They are farming away, but looking up at the sky, it can be seen that the planes are missing. One morning, on 21 August 2019 at 5.45 a.m., I looked out the door and up at the sky - 33 lines of jets passing overhead and a blue sky over that. When I went out ten minutes later, all the droppings from the planes had merged together. There was no sign of my blue sky - gone completely. In recent times, however, we have seen a blue sky as far as we can see on either end, and we are glad to see that. It is very easy, however, to blame the farmer or the poor man or woman going to work, or the hauliers who are going through every hoop to deliver what they have to and who are penalised in every way, and now we are talking about increasing carbon tax. It is very easy to blame these people when, with emissions, really it is up we should be looking and not down. I love our environment as much as anyone else, and seek to protect our rivers and our lakes in every way. Instead of talking about the climate, why do the Minister and the Government not talk about the treatment plants around the country? Take our county, for example. Kilcummin has been waiting for a treatment plant for 18 years, Castleisland has been waiting for an extension to a sewerage scheme for 33 years, and then there are places like Curragh, Scartaglin and Brosna. People cannot get permission there to build houses around the villages because there is no treatment plant, which only draws them into Killarney. The Government is to blame as much as farmers and other people for damaging our environment. It is a fact that the local authorities right around the country, not alone in Kerry, are to blame for the most pollution of our rivers, lakes, and indeed our bathing areas. Ballybunion and other places have gone from excellent to very good, or whatever, water quality. That is where we are going because the Government is not looking at the things it should be dealing with and putting money into them. Several Governments - the previous one and the one before - have let rural Ireland down when it comes to providing treatment plants and dealing with the environment, in our county anyway.	spk_468

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-05-13	dail	33	Covid-19 (Education and Skills): Statements	dbsect_7	I appreciate that the Minister has a very difficult job. If I was a betting man he might be praying that he would get some other post in the present transactions on the programme for Government. So many of the children wanted the calculated grades assessment that I am glad they have got it but there are other pupils and students who felt they would do better if they sat the leaving certificate. I would have thought that as the numbers sitting it would then be reduced the Department would be able to cater for them to sit the exam. The Minister is saying that may happen some time later in the year but a year is then gone out of their lives and we have lost something there. How does the Minister propose to cater for mature students who were hoping to sit the exams or students who want to increase their marks in a subject that they needed for a specific course they were hoping to take? In line with many other Deputies, I have serious concerns about the July provision for children with Down's syndrome and the inclusion of other children in that category because the parents of these children are really suffering and going through a lot at present. I am hoping that project will be offered and available to those children and parents. Every year parents' income for the previous year, or the year before that, is assessed for the SUSI grant. Surely this year's income will be assessed when students and parents apply now for the grant. I hope that is the way they will be assessed this year, not on last year's income or that of the year before because incomes are way down. That is another problem caused by holding the exam later in the year. The students will be applying next year for college and the points will be raised. The 2021 class will be affected by more pupils presenting next year. We need to talk about starting back to school in September and to consider how children with underlying conditions such as asthma and respiratory problems and teachers will be facilitated. We have to engage with Bus Éireann for bringing children to school in the new year because if social distancing is still the order of the day there will have to be more buses and much more thought put into this. There is a lot of work to be done. I know the Minister has less than a minute to reply but if he does not answer everything I have said he may send on the reply please.	spk_100
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-05-13	dail	33	Covid-19 (Transport): Statements	dbsect_8	I am glad to get the opportunity to raise several issues with the Minister today. I will start with the problem of the youngest person who approached me. I refer to youngsters above the age of 16 who could legitimately get a provisional driver licence. We are told they will be able to apply for these licences online on 20 May. That is great, but they need to have personal services cards to do so and there is nowhere currently open where they can get these cards. Can that matter be addressed?  I refer also to provisional licence holders who have done their theory test, have everything in order and have been waiting for months to do the test. Can anything be done to speed up the driver test for these youngsters who have been waiting so long? They need their cars to go to work. Taxis and how they can be supported has not been mentioned during this pandemic. Can the Minister and the Government do something about taxis? These operators provide a wonderful service and they jump through a lot of hoops to do so. They are in serious trouble and some of them may not start up again when the lockdown is over.  Hotels, pubs and guest houses around our county are in an awful state. They are supposed to open on certain dates, but many are afraid to so because there is no certainty around business or when tourists will be allowed to visit our country again.  This brings me to the testing of lorries, buses, vans and jeeps. No testing is going on at present. We are told that operators' certificates will cover them until some time in October. Will the Minister ensure an extra grace period when testing resumes? They will not all be tested in one day or in one week. We were under pressure to keep vehicles tested as it was. There is one anomaly that will certainly have to be addressed. We were looking for a solution to this before the lockdown. If a vehicle has been off the road for three or four months and it is tested, a 12-month certificate will not be issued. Only a six-month certificate is issued. On behalf of the haulage industry and bus operators, I ask the Minister to ensure that when vehicle testing resumes, 12-month certificates can be issued, for the first time at least. That is vital. Otherwise the system will be clogged again. This has been bad enough for long enough, and now testing is not proceeding at all. When the lockdown is over and the country starts moving again, I appeal to the Minister not to stop operators again by only issuing six-month certificates. I refer also to elderly people who have been cocooning in their homes for the past two months with their cars parked in their yards. Is there any possibility of refunding motor tax? As I have said to previous Ministers, seasonal workers were not provided for in the pandemic supports that were given to many people. The same is true for people above the age of 66 who were employing people, because they were over 66 and possibly receiving a pension. Will the Minister bring them up to equivalence with the €350 payment others are getting?The Killarney bypass has been proposed for the last 16 or 17 years. I ask the Minister to give funding again this year for the preparatory work that is needed to get it going.	spk_194
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-05-13	dail	33	Covid-19 (Justice and Equality): Statements	dbsect_10	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about Cahersiveen to the Minister and Minister of State because the first I knew of this, like all the other elected representatives, was on the Monday before the asylum seekers came to Cahersiveen. The Government did open this direct provision centre in Cahersiveen. When it was proved wrong in many other parts of the country last year, it admitted it was wrong and that there should be proper consultation before that happened in any other part of the country. It did this without proper consultation. We have come to know that the HSE, which is responsible for health, did not approve of bringing the refugees to Cahersiveen but nevertheless the Government brought these unfortunate people from a hotel in Dublin where there had been cases of coronavirus. People were not tested before they came to Cahersiveen. It is now believed that at least 24 people, between refugees and people working at the centre, have presented with the virus. Some of the workers have also contracted the virus. For many days when people presented with the virus in the centre, more were in and out of the centre and around the town.At that stage, locals started to worry about their own health and avoided the town of Cahersiveen. Many of them are still doing so because they want to protect their own health. They know that the virus has been, or still is, in the hotel. They are not sure if it is still there or not. We have seen the refugees hanging out of windows so they can be seen through a locked gate.	spk_283

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-05-13	dail	33	Covid-19 (Justice and Equality): Statements	dbsect_10	It is clear that the refugees want to leave Cahersiveen. It is clear that the people of Cahersiveen, the locals of the Iveragh Peninsula, want the centre closed down now. It is now evident that the Skellig Star Hotel is not suitable. The asylum seekers were packed in on top of each other in the first place, with three or so to a room. That is not acceptable. They were told to self-isolate but there is no compulsion on the residents to stay in the hotel and they are out around the town. It is not suitable. The back or side of the premises is not enough for men, women and children for 24 hours a day and seven days a week. I am asking both the Minister and the Minister of State, on behalf of the refugees and the people of Cahersiveen, to close down the centre now. We have seen, in every other instance, that one has to get change-of-use planning permission. The hotel was built as a hotel in the first place but is now being used much differently. Why was change-of-use planning permission not sought? The Government did not seek that permission. I want to give the Minister and the Minister of State the chance to answer. Will they close the centre now or not? They have a minute to answer.	spk_287
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-04-30	dail	33	Covid-19 (Taoiseach): Statements	dbsect_3	I wish to commiserate with all the families who have lost loved ones to this deadly disease. I want to thank all the people, each and every one, for the extraordinary sacrifice they have made and undertaken in the past six or seven weeks. I am calling on the Taoiseach to get as many people back to work as soon as is safely possible. This includes construction work and builders who may be working on one-off houses. I want the Taoiseach to explore the possibility of getting those people back as soon as possible as well as in industries where social distancing is possible. Many companies and businesspeople will be unable to return, sadly. For farmers, I am asking the Taoiseach to open up the marts and at least allow competition in the market. We should allow those over 70 years of age out of confinement, even with a mask to go to the local shop. It is not fair on them when we see people coming here off ferries and planes and going in their midst and close to them into holiday homes and local shops. No one is monitoring whether they are isolating when they come in off these ferries. Like Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, I am asking the Taoiseach to consider those over 66 years of age who were employing people and who gave employment. We should bring their pension up to €350. What about the seasonal workers? Kerry depends so much on hotel workers, bus drivers and all that. If the lockdown had not come for another week or two, all these people would have been back to work. Now, they are running down their stamps. Some of them do not have any stamps left. They are not entitled to jobseeker's welfare because their partners have other incomes. They are left behind. Following the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael budget, tonight 2 cent per litre is being added by way of carbon tax to the price of petrol and diesel while the whole of the country is closed down - that is the fact of it. They are doing their best to get the Green Party on board. What will the carbon tax charge be when they have the Green Party with them? They are talking about reducing the national herd. We read today that the US is in serious trouble in providing beef yet we are supposed to reduce the national herd. I am amazed that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are considering blocking the Shannon liquefied natural gas project. North Kerry has been starved of jobs for years. Millions of euro have been put into this project, not to mind the importance of having access to this natural gas. Why is the Government not calling for an investigation into how and when this virus began in China? Is it the case that the Government does not want to know? I can tell the Taoiseach that all those who have lost loved ones to this deadly disease would like to know and be told the truth. They cannot touch, embrace or talk to their loved ones who are gone forever. This virus was in China long before 20 January.Some of the PPE the Government paid for and went out of its way to thank publicly the Chinese for was given to them by the Italians in early December. I am asking the Government not to buy another bottle from the Chinese to contain this virus until we know the truth. The people are entitled to the truth. I am calling on the United Nations to carry out an international investigation into what happened. We need to know.

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-04-30	dail	33	Covid-19 (Business, Enterprise and Innovation): Statements	dbsect_7	Many companies will not recover. We need to assist every employer who is going to attempt to carry on in any way we can because every job is valuable. As I said in my questions to the Taoiseach, I ask the Minister to explore every avenue when it comes to construction work, building companies and the construction of one-off houses. Every situation is different. I am sure that each person in the State realises the importance of social distancing and will be doing everything they can to ensure that they follow the guidelines.However, they need advice in respect of vans and work vehicles. They need help regarding the cost of insurance, rates and electricity bills. They need assistance with those matters. My understanding of rates is that if people are not making any money, they would not have to pay the rates at all, or a reduced rate if on a lower income. We need to assist the local authorities because the amount of revenue they are going to lose will be massive. Clarity is needed in the context of hardware stores. Are they exempted at present? What about machinery stores? I come now to Kerry and the importance of the tourism industry, hotels, restaurants, guest houses, bed-and-breakfast establishments and pubs. These businesses are asking that the Government apply a zero rate of VAT for the rest of this year, as well as providing assistance with their buildings and the way they present their premises for people coming in if they are given the green light to open. We realise that we will not have any foreign visitors and we will be depending on people from around the country when things open up to get these businesses going and making a turnover again. I refer to bus companies that provide transport for schoolchildren. The Government states that the schools are going to reopen in June for those sitting the leaving certificate, but there is a serious problem regarding transporting children. Maybe the Government is talking about reopening schools in urban areas but children in rural areas are entitled to get to school as well and there will be a problem in the context of the size of the buses needed to facilitate the social distancing that is required. I know that no interaction has taken place up until now, but it is very important that the Government interacts with the bus companies and Bus Éireann on how the children are going to be brought to school for the remaining term of this year. In view of the fact that the Government will not relent and forget about the leaving certificate for this year, it must realise now that there is a serious problem with transporting children to school. That needs to be discussed with the contractors to ensure the children are brought there safely and are looked after. It is very important. Seasonal workers are also important. They are totally left behind and Kerry depends so much on those workers. Most of their stamps have now run out and in the next couple of weeks all of their stamps will be gone. This concerns hotel workers, pub workers and bus drivers. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae stated, there is a yard full of buses parked in Killarney. It cost millions of euro to fund what has gone into that yard and they are all parked.	spk_163

Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-04-30	dail	33	Covid-19 (Agriculture, Food and the Marine): Statements	dbsect_9	I thank and congratulate the farming community around the country, especially in Kerry, for continuing to work, as it always has in the past, when most other activities are closed down. I am glad that, when we look out the door or go down the road, we are meeting farmers with tractors, jeeps and trailers and that they are continuing to work, carry on and do their bit. There is another thing I have to say that I have said to other Members in the Chamber. It is widely recognised that there is no excess carbon being emitted, or emissions being created, by farmers now, even though they are working to their maximum as they always have done. People who were focusing their attention on farmers and asking them to reduce the national herd had better start looking elsewhere. Maybe they should look up at the sky on a fine day. We can now see a blue sky from end to end so maybe the planes up there were the cause of the trouble. Maybe other things around the world were causing the trouble because it is not the farmer. The farmer is in serious trouble. Whether a weanling is to be sold or an animal is going to the factory, farmers are losing between €200 and €300 per head. I ask the Minister to do something about the marts. Every mart, whether in Macroom, Kenmare, Castleisland, Cahersiveen or Dingle, has a capacity to hold maybe 200 or 300 people.Yet, at present the farmer is being asked to drop his animals off at the gate or maybe the mart manager will come out and buy the cattle with some buyer or whatever. That is not satisfactory. While I recognise that it is important to sell the animals, it is equally important to get a good and fair price. There is no competition in the market now. I am asking the Minister to talk to the mart people, the Irish Farmers Association and everyone involved to see if we could get the marts open in a capacity whereby perhaps 20 buyers could go in with ten sellers at a time. That should surely be possible. I call on the Minister to do that sooner rather than later. If there is no competition - there is none at present between buyers - then farmers will not realise the best price, the price they should be getting. The question of meat processing plants has been raised here. Some of the meat plants admitted that they had to process Polish beef. At the same time, I know farmers around me everywhere who cannot get their animals into the factory. If they have 20 animals to sell or put through the factory, they have to wait. Maybe the factory will take five or six. They then have to wait weeks and that is costing them. John Tyson of Tyson Foods in America says he is closing down many of his processing plants. Surely there is an opportunity for us to explore other markets, whether they are west or east of us. Anyway, we have to do something. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been the Minister all this time. It is him I am asking what can be done. Can he do more for the farmers? How much money was sent back from the beef exceptional aid measure last year? The rules were totally wrong and the regulations meted out to farmers did not allow them to get the money. Many farmers did not access the BEAM at all. Will the Minister address that? The money we are getting from Europe is paltry. They should be doing far more for the farmers.	spk_366
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-04-02	dail	33	Covid-19 (Health): Statements	dbsect_4	"I too sympathise with all those who have lost family members over the past three or four weeks, for whatever reason. It has been a very difficult time for them because nobody can assist them, grieve with them or go to funerals. I knew a 91 year old man who, when he knew he was dying, said to his son, ""Goddamit, there will be no neighbour or anyone coming to the funeral."" The son is bothered to this day about it because his father was a grand man. It is hurting many people and families that nobody can help them to grieve or start the grieving process as was the tradition in Kerry and all around the country, where neighbours went to help families grieve and survive. I sympathise will all of those. I thank all the front-line staff, the nurses, doctors, kitchen staff and cleaners who are vital in all our healthcare facilities, whether in hospitals such as Tralee General Hospital or Killarney or Kenmare district hospitals, or nursing homes around our county. All those involved deserve any accolade we can give them.We will ensure we will fight for whatever PPE they need to keep our health services going. I join Deputy Michael Healy-Rae in raising the home help service. Those Deputies who were in the last Dáil will recall that day after day, I raised the need for home help services to enable people to stay in their homes for as long as possible. I assure the Minister that anyone in County Kerry who receives home help had to fight to get it. It is not the case that some of those who get this help should not be getting it. They are entitled to it and they have it. I ask the Minister to let them continue to get it. It is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. If these people do not have home help workers coming to see them, they could die of other causes in their own homes. I beg the Government to do something to ensure there is a change in the current approach. It is valuable for us to be able to come in here today to raise this issue, which is so important for elderly people around County Kerry. I would like to mention as another example of the importance of this issue the case of 72 year old man who went into a shop the other day and was accosted by some nosy parker who said he should not be out getting his messages. We cannot trap or isolate elderly people entirely. I have to raise the issue of the air ambulance for the south west that was promised in the last programme for Government. It will close tomorrow evening due to funding difficulties. I contacted the office of the Minister, Deputy Harris, early in March, but I heard nothing back. I have since been in contact with the Tánaiste's office. I beg and implore the Government to keep this vital service going. The air ambulance is vital for people who manifest with cardiac failure, stroke and various other illnesses and who are far away from where they need to go. I thank the Government and, in particular, Dr. Tony Holohan, for the massive work they have been doing. I see that the Taoiseach thanked the Chinese for giving us the PPE stuff we need. I have to say I would thank the Chinese as well if they had kept their virus. If that had happened, we would not need the gowns and the equipment we are looking for now."	spk_34
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-04-02	dail	33	Covid-19 (Social Protection): Statements	dbsect_5	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about a few anomalies. I thank the Government for many of the measures it has brought in, but we need to trim up a few things to make it equal for people who are not being catered for. Kerry, Killarney in particular, is basically a tourist county. Many seasonal workers who traditionally work from the start of March until the end of October are missing out on the Covid-19 payment. In recent days the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, suggested that they were included, but I do not think they are included because the phone is reddened at home with people saying they are not being considered. If it were not for the coronavirus, they would be all working now. This is when they would be making their few bob to keep them going for the year. They are dependent on the work from March to October to keep them going. I am asking the Minister to see if she can do something for the people who have been left behind because it is just not fair. As Deputy Berry said, there are people over the age of 66 who may be on a pension but for various reasons, including money they may have borrowed, still continue to work. At present they are getting a small payment of about €200. I am asking the Minister in these times to bring their payment up to €350. I am not asking for the €350 on top of their pension, but at least to bring it up €350 to give them some parity. The Government should do the best it can and operate as fair as it can. We all, including the Minister, know that in the past 12 months farmers have been hitting very hard times with very low financial returns. It is worse than ever. I do not honestly know how they will continue. I know that some of them have applied for the Covid-19 payment. I do not know whether they will get it. I am depending on the Government to ensure they do. Pressure on health, including mental health, is a serious matter to which we must attend, but people can only take so much. The farmers have taken a lot over the past year and a half from the factories and with other things that have happened in their sector. Bad weather does not seem to manifest itself up here on the eastern side of the country at all. It has been pouring in the west of Ireland since last August until very recently. Farmers are depressed and very downtrodden at present. There are many poor farmers out there and I ask the Minister to look sympathetically on those who apply for the Covid-19 payment. We are hearing that the banks are offering people a three-month holiday on loan payments. I am also hearing a worrying thing about the banks.They want the interest before the crisis finishes or, at the latest, when people start paying back again. They are saying the principal can be paid back at the end but they are suggesting that the interest on the principal that is being forgone for three months will have to be paid up when people start paying back again. That will drive many people under and I am asking the Government to talk to these banks. It has a very sizeable share in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks. We lost so many companies and people between 2008 and 2012 and we cannot afford to lose any more.  There is another issue. The phone is reddened at home about it. It is students who have paid their rent up-front in universities and colleges around the country. I have no problem in the world in naming the campus in the University of Limerick. They are refusing to pay back the money that has been paid up-front to the end of May. It would be €1,000 or up to €1,500 in some cases. These universities are saving now on fuel, heating, lighting and refuse collection because there will be practically no students there. There may be a few from abroad, a very small number, who are staying there but aside from all that, these campuses should be giving back the rent to the parents and students involved. These people at home who are looking for the money back have no work. All they have now if they can get it is the €350 for each person who was working, and in many cases there was only one person working. It is very unfair and it is setting a very bad example when the national universities will not pay back this money. How can we expect private landlords, who are also in the frame and are not paying back, to behave? I am very sorry they are not because they are hurting honest, good-living, hard-working people who do not have a leprechaun behind them or a gold mine. They need their money back to give them a chance to start again next September or October, hoping that we start again. It is very unfair to hold on to money that is not being used. The Minister and Government have us told that anyone with a mortgage or loan will get a chance to pay it back. Those people, if they do have loans or mortgages, are going to get a chance and they will not have to pay until a certain time, until the economy starts rolling again. These parents and students need to get their money back as soon as possible. We are in a time of crisis. We must all pull together. Something that I did not get to mention in respect of the testing is that we need a test place in Killarney. The old St. Finan's Hospital has a grand way in and a grand way out. A test centre could be set up there to cater for an area within a 25 mile radius, including Killarney, east Kerry and even into north-west Cork, as well as down to Kenmare and Sneem. Those people are very far away from Tralee and I am asking the Government to try to set up a centre there. People are asking why it is taking so long to get tested. That is a worry. I had a couple waiting practically ten days before they were called. The other problem is that we are waiting too long for the test results to come back.I am not giving out or scolding. Rather, I am asking the Government to do what it can do to ensure something positive happens in this regard.  The issue of nursing homes was raised. I have been contacted by nursing homes that are having difficulty maintaining staff numbers. They cannot recruit staff in the same manner as the HSE. I ask the Government to keep a watch on nursing homes and ensure that when the number of staff working in them at the coalface drops, assistance is provided. People are worried. It will fall back on patients in nursing homes if they are not properly looked after.	spk_79
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-03-05	dail	33	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_6	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about this important topic. Farmers, especially suckler and beef farmers, are at a crossroads. Many are not making money. Indeed, they are losing money. We must remember that farmers are not getting payments from Europe as a gift or present. They are supposed to compensate them for not being paid properly and in order that food can be sold more cheaply to the consumers of Europe. We must remember that farmers are entitled to payments because they are not being paid properly for the food they produce. If farmers were being paid properly, they would not be looking for payments. We must remember that farmers are not beggarmen, thieves or robbers of any kind or distinction but honest and hard-working people who deserve to be paid properly. Mention has been made that the CAP is to be cut by €200 million. Whoever makes up the next Government, whether it is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Green Party, Sinn Féin or whoever, it cannot accept a cut during the negotiations because that would sound the death knell for rural Ireland. It has been said that funding for Pillar 1 could drop by 10%. We cannot accept that. If Ireland has to pay more into the fund, surely we should insist that we get more out of it. Pillar 2, which includes rural development, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, the areas of natural constraint scheme, ANC, and the pearl mussel scheme, is meant to be cut by 25%. If that happens, it will greatly affect all of the payments coming into the poorer and more deprived areas in rural Ireland. It has also been said that young farmers who do not give more than 50% of their time to the farm - part-time farmers - will not be entitled to payments. That is absolutely scandalous and ridiculous and it cannot be allowed to happen. Many young farmers cannot survive on the bit of land they have but they do want to keep the door open on their farms. They want to keep their roads in such a way that someone is going up and down and ensure there is life to be seen. It cannot all be about planting forestry and closing down rural Ireland. If we are worth our salt at all, we cannot stand for that. I ask whomever is in the next Government not to stand for that.  There is also talk that, outside of designated areas, regulations and State penalties will apply to carbon-rich soils if farmers do simple things like draining the land to improve it. We cannot allow that to happen. Farmers need to utilise the little bits of land they have and produce as much as they can if they are to survive.When we discuss the levelling off of payment schemes, especially for sheep farmers, it must be remembered farmers in the west need to get more attention than the farmers on the eastern side of the country who have all the options. In places like Glencar, Mangerton in Kilgarvan or other mountainy-hilly land along the west coast, there is only the option of sheep, suckler or beef farming. Farmers cannot plough, sow grain or milk cows on such land. Those farmers have to be looked after and their payments cannot be cut. Maybe the bigger fellows on the eastern side can afford it. The Ceann Comhairle is looking at me. He is a part-time farmer as well.	spk_43
Danny HealyRae	67	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2020-03-05	dail	33	European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_6	Farmers in the west cannot afford any cuts, especially those in Kerry who are trying to survive but are not being paid for their produce. We have raised so much about the sucklers. If they do not get some payment in the near future, many of them will close down and have to give up because they are not making a profit. They cannot afford any cut in their payments. Again, it is not a gift or a present like is got at Christmas. It is compensation for not being paid properly for the food they produce.	spk_45

I thank the people of Kerry who voted for one of two Healy-Raes, especially those who voted for me. I also thank the people who canvassed for me and who went out and worked for me. I do not call them a team but an army. On one specific evening, 162 people left a place in Killarney and headed off in every direction to help me get re-elected. Many of the local newspapers and other media had me written off. They had me dead and buried. The story in the local newspaper was that Fianna Fáil was smelling my blood but I have all my blood yet and it will have to wait a while before it gets any scent of it. It was on the wrong trail and scent. I am glad to be standing here in this Chamber today, having been elected again by the people of Kerry. I thank each and every person who did anything and everything for me and who ensured that I got re-elected. I do not know who will be on the Taoiseach's side of the House and in government but they will have to listen to the needs of the people whom we represent. Our health service in Kerry is in a shambles. There are people on chairs instead of trolleys now. The cry is now from people who have been in chairs for 48 hours and who want to at least get onto a trolley. That is not good enough. It is not the way to be dealing with our sick people. People get sick and get old and they need to be treated fairly and squarely, as they have not been treated.  On mental health, suicide is ravaging our county and I know it is doing the same in others. We have hardly any mental health service at all in Kerry. There is not one mental health bed. With regard to people with disabilities, it is a shame and a disgrace that elderly parents' biggest worry is what will happen to their disabled son or daughter. They may be 78 or 80 years of age and wondering where their Johnny or Patrick will go when they pass on. A new thing came out during the election campaign. Pensioners who worked for 40, 45 or 50 years of their lives and who served this country well cannot be asked to go on the dole for two or three years. That is absolutely ridiculous. It is unfair and it is not right or just. We will not stand for that, whoever is in the Government. I want to thank especially the people who saw my back was to the wall. I saw it in many of the boxes in east Kerry. I want to thank them for giving me between 60% and 90% of the votes that came out of the boxes. I do not believe that happened in any other part of the country for any other candidate. I thank the people who did that for me to ensure I was returned to represent them in this Parliament, Dáil Éireann. I am most thankful and grateful to them.	spk_60

It is surely a problem in Kerry and especially in Killarney, where rents have gone from €700 and €800 a month to €1,200 and €1,500. People just cannot afford to pay such amounts. The real problem is that we do not have enough houses. It has to be remembered and acknowledged by the Minister of State that in many cases the Government is taking 50% because the landlords are taxed 50% when they go over a certain threshold. The Government should do something about that because landlords are exiting the sector and selling off their houses to private interests. They are getting out because with all that is involved they cannot comply. As dear as the rents are, they cannot make ends meet with the tax that they have to pay. The HAP scheme is a disaster. It is purely a means of getting people off the housing list. More supply is the answer. Another problem is that local authorities are taking much too long to turn around the vacant houses. The tenant purchase scheme that was to assist us in doing that is no longer an option for many tenants because 80% who apply to buy out their houses are not qualifying. We have asked the Government often enough to do something about that but it has done nothing about it. Another desperate thing that the Government is doing is taking people with three or four children off the housing list when their income exceeds €33,500.	spk_564

However, in Kerry, for a person to get home help another person must die. Why is it that Kerry has been without funding for the provision of home help services since last May? The wife of an elderly man of 92 years of age was on Radio Kerry over three days pleading for home help services for him.

The fact is that the Minister and his Government have retained the four-stage process demanded by the Department. That is slowing down the building of social housing. How many times have we asked the Minister to bring forward the tenant purchase scheme to allow pensioners to buy out the houses they have rented, in some cases for 40 years? In Kerry there is funding to build just 12 rural cottages from 2016 to 2021. Rent costs have reached €1,400 in the town of Killarney. I asked the Minister to do something about the tax that is being levied. In most cases the Government levies a tax worth 50% of the rent.The housing assistance payment is a disaster. It is €690, including the 20%. This is all that a tenant can get in the County of Kerry. On top of this the tenant has to pay money from that amount to the local authority. The Rebuilding Ireland loan is a disaster because it is so hard and there are so many hoops for people to jump through. It puts people through the mill, over and over again, before they actually get the funding. I am aware of a case of a vulture fund demanding to put a man, his wife and their four children, with his mother and his brother who is in a wheelchair, out on the road. This is instead of the Government buying that house by giving funding to the local authority to buy it. This would give the family a chance to rent it back. We have asked to do that several times. Why will the local authority not do it? It could buy the house and give the people the dignity to stay in the house. I put it to the Minister that there will have to be a house somewhere. This is the truth. There will have to be a house somewhere-----	spk_546

Hardly any felling licences have been granted this year. The building of roads has been held up, where farmers have invested money in forestry and they are not being allowed to build roads because of serial objectors objecting to permission for building these roads. The Government has angered and frustrated many farmers in rural areas by telling them that 2020 forestry premium payments must be applied for online. We hear the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, announcing broadband and we have heard this so many times before but it is still the case today and it will be for many years that the only line many of these farmers have is the clothesline. It is unfair to ask these people to apply for their forestry premiums online. That was never written into their contracts when they went into forestry.

If we cannot keep a GP in Milltown, there is no hope that outlying places around the coast of Kerry will have a GP of their own. The Government’s policies are wrong.

In Rathmore, where we have ended up with half of a GP service, if people get sick, they have to travel all the way to Millstreet. That is not acceptable.

I also thank Senator Dolan for all he has done in his role as a Senator and in the years prior to that to help people with disabilities to have as normal a life as possible. I only have a short amount of time. Many people with disabilities acquired the serious disability at a moment's notice. Ian O'Connell is a lovely young fellow in Killarney, County Kerry, who had a serious accident. He is doing his level best to maintain a normal outlook. He is continuing to go to school in Killarney and he intends to lead as normal a life as possible. The accident happened like a flash. He was on his bicycle in Killarney National Park, where one would think one would be safe. He is doing fine and we all look up to him for the courageous manner in which he is taking on his disability. People like his parents need all the support and help they can get to ensure that people like Ian can continue on a normal track and retain their dignity and pride. Whether they are pursuing job opportunities, socialising or anything else, it is important that those people retain their independence as much as possible. I again ask the Minister of State to ensure that children with Down's syndrome are included in the July provision. It is very important for them. They have a disability as well and they should have the opportunity to avail of the July provision. Family members take on the role of personal assistants at a moment's notice when an accident, stroke or something else happens. We must help those family members and carers in whatever way we can.

He has closed down most of County Kerry and made smithereens of the social fabric people traditionally enjoyed.I advise the Tánaiste to get into a car with the Minister, Deputy Ross, and his Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, any night and drive around the county to see the damage and mayhem the Government has caused with its Road Traffic (Amendment) Act. The Irish pub was known all around the world as a tourism attraction, a place of culture, traditional music, song and dance, story telling, a place where farmers and workers met to have a conversation, rich with characters who provided original entertainment. People such as Tom Cruise visited Loo Bridge. Sadly he would be unable to visit it again as it is closed. Many cities around the world have tried to replicate the Irish country pub but now people all around Kerry are afraid to go out and are like rabbits trapped in a burrow. Too far east is west. Does the Government have anyone measuring depression rates and how much extra is being spent on anti-depressant medication and mental health? Pubs have closed down in every town and village already: Rathmore, Kilgarvan, Currow, Faranfore, Curran Scartaglen where Tom Fleming's pub was the nucleus of Slieve Luachra and Irish music, Kenmare, Sneem, Castleisland, Brosna, Knocknagoshel, Caherdaniel in Waterville, Cahersiveen, Killorglin and Glencar where even someone like Schumacher could not do more than 30 km/h. What has the Government done? It has stopped many people going out to socialise. It does not want people to have a car. One Deputy suggests that 30 or 40 people should get into one car. What kind of a batmobile does he propose? Will there be baby seats in it? The Government wants to stop people farming. Ye do not want them eating meat or cutting turf or timber to keep themselves warm. The Government might wake up and analyse the lunacy of its actions if oil became scarce for two or three months. The health service is in a shambles. Kenmare and Dingle hospitals are only half open. The Government gave €900 million for two treatment plants in Dublin. It is all about Dublin. There was €145 million in total expenditure for Kerry County Council for the year but there was €900 million for one project in Dublin. What is the Government going to do about the people who are trapped and isolated in rural Ireland? I am asking the Government to provide a permit for people who are travelling only on local rural class three roads so that they can have their two pints and drive home on those roads. If they stray beyond those roads, then nail them, but the Government should give them a chance to live because all work and no play makes Jack a very dull boy.	spk_137

It has closed down Bord na Móna and told its workers it would give them green jobs. The only green they will see is if the door on the dole office is painted green.

We have had direct provision centres in Killarney and Kenmare for many years. Many of these people have come and gone. They have moved on. I have a problem when too many of them are crammed in together, which is something I have seen. Some of the situations are very tough. Problems arise when a whole family is put into a room. The Minister of State needs to cut his cloth to suit to his measure. If he tries to bring too many of them together in one place, the local services will be unable to cater for the people who are already there and the people who are coming. In such circumstances, there will not be adequate provision for anyone. We need to discuss how these people can be managed fairly and humanely. I have had conversations and I have helped various people along the way. The big problem for many of them is that they have nothing to do. Many of them would like to work. That is another issue and another problem. Discussions are needed when it is proposed to bring big groups of people into small rural places. Problems will arise if there are not enough doctors or schools. It is not just about acquiring a building, putting a lot of people into it and saying they will be all right. That is not fair on the immigrants who are coming or on the communities they are arriving into. We have multidenominational people from all over the world in Killarney. I have to mention the Bangladeshi people who are playing a positive role in the town. They are working and living in the community. Many of them came around 1998 and are proud to be Irish citizens now. They say ""I am a Kerryman"". They are playing their part. They love to work. They are positive in the community. I have to praise them as highly as I can because they are great people. These very good men, women and children are playing an important role in Killarney. There is one other problem. We are talking about bringing people into local areas, but the opposite is happening as well. People who have jobs and skills are being sent home even though their employers want to keep them. It is very wrong that they are being shoved out. I know three of them at the present time. Their employers want to keep them, but they are not being allowed to stay. It is hard to understand what is going on when things like that are happening. There should be some facility to try to assist those people to remain. It should be done more quickly than at present. I know an employer who has said he cannot replace a man if he is deported. There is a need. They do a certain kind of work. They have certain kinds of skills.

That means drains will be blocked and pumps will be switched off so the bogs can be flooded. That is all that is involved and there will be a small bit of work for a couple of years. What will be the green jobs? Members here speak about defending workers but they also talk about climate change. The climate has always been changing and there is nothing we can do about it. There is nothing the Ministers can do about it either. There would have been a future for the midlands and Longford, in particular, if the Government had behaved. It is trying to kid these people into accepting the idea that they will be provided with jobs and trained. What will they be trained for and what sort of jobs will they be? These people are asking those questions. It is clear what is happening in the Chamber. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are trying to be greener than the Greens. The Government is being supported in its actions closing Bord na Móna by Fianna Fáil. In the budget a carbon tax was put on the people and the argument is it will compensate the people who worked on the bogs. It will not compensate them because their jobs and livelihoods are gone. The workers are part of this but there are businesses that were living off those jobs and they will go as well. Many shops and supermarkets will close because the people will not be able to give them business. These workers will probably have to go to Dublin to create more traffic jams. What about the horticulture and composting sectors, which could have provided a future? They could have been there for an unlimited period. Where will people now get briquettes? We will import more coal from Poland, other parts of Europe or Russia. We had our own peat for many years in the midlands that could make briquettes but that market will go. The Government would have got VAT and other taxes from it but now people will get coal, timber and other fuel on the black market. They will have to keep a fire at home unless the Government wants them to perish with the cold. Ministers have spoken about insulating houses but at the rate the Government is going, it will not have them insulated for the next 50 years. At the same time, this generation is supposed to carry on like this. I am very disappointed when I see what is going on and we cannot stop the midlands from being closed along with the bogs that gave a livelihood to so many people and families over generations. This is being done in the name of climate change so that parties can try to be greener than the Greens. They are not even in the Chamber for this debate. The Government is supported by Fianna Fáil but the people in the Gallery are being let down. They will tell Members at the next election how they have been let down.	spk_404
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-11-05	dail	32	Illegal Drugs: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_35	I am glad to have a small amount of time to talk about this very important matter. I thank Deputy Curran and the Fianna Fáil Party for giving us the opportunity to discuss the drugs problem because it is a fact that drugs are available in every town and small village in County Kerry. I am sorry that I have to admit it, but it is a fact. It is also a fact that we are losing the battle and many families are affected, as it has resulted in many suicides and deaths. The closure of Garda stations on both sides of Kenmare Bay is an issue I have raised several times as it has given drug gangs endless opportunities to bring drugs into the county. Garda stations have been closed along the Beara and Iveragh peninsulas. In places like Sneem and Laraugh vast tracts of water are open to bring in drugs. They have to be brought in somewhere and they are. The closure of local Garda stations has denied gardaí the opportunity to accumulate the information they were able to accumulate in previous years. Gardaí in patrol cars are working to the best of their ability, but the loss of gardaí in local areas has been immense and had a disastrous effect. I do not believe cannabis or any other drug should be legalised. I am disappointed with the Deputy who suggested they should because they should not be. The Minister for Health has relaxed some rules. Individuals who are apprehended for the first or a second time for drugs now have to be let go by gardaí, which is absolutely ridiculous. No one in the Chamber asked for this, yet the Minister for Health introduced that policy. We are very disappointed with him. If a young person is stopped in Killarney today, how will gardaí know that he or she was let go somewhere else? How do gardaí know how many times the same person has been caught and released? It is a joke. Thugs are being let go. I feel for young parents today who are raising children because they have a serious task ahead of them.	spk_499

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-10-23	dail	32	Public Ownership of the National Broadband Network: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_35	It appears it is a case of Dublin has it and to hell with the rest of the country. All this Government cares about is Dublin and the eastern side of the country. Once everyone in these areas has broadband, there is no hurry with the rest of the country; people can wait. In rural Ireland, landlines are a rarity and mobile coverage is virtually non-existent. There is no coverage on the three roads leading to and from Farranfore airport. Several places around south Kerry, including Cahirciveen, which previously had coverage now have only minimal coverage and households that previously had coverage do not have it anymore. This Government is rolling out so much that if it was doing anything, every field in Ireland would be covered, but it is not. New technology is coming on stream all of the time. Is the Government up-to-date in that regard? Maybe we could get broadband via satellite or another way quicker, easier and cheaper. Is the Government looking into that? I have previously called in this Chamber for the Government to buyback Eir because it is critical to the provision of this service. At the rate at which parts of Eir are being sold off, there will be nothing left. Now is the time to make a move and buy back Eir.	spk_405
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-10-23	dail	32	Finance Bill 2019: Second Stage	dbsect_38	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on important matters relating to the budget. The first is my displeasure with the increase in carbon tax. As everyone knows, we have paid carbon tax for many years and it is just another tax for hard-pressed motorists. As the Minister of State will know, people in rural Ireland need a car and cannot move anywhere without one. The days of walking or cycling to work are over. It is not economically efficient because time is now so valuable. Let us remember all the drivers travelling to work, mothers taking their children to school, and youngsters going to college, apprenticeships or whatever. We in rural Ireland cannot move anywhere without a car. In places in the west such as Glencar or Cahirsiveen, the next stop to the west is America and people must travel east for everything. Even to visit a hospital in Cork, it takes two and a half hours to travel from Cahirsiveen or Dingle, and there is no other way of doing it because there is no public transport, no train or bus, at the time one might want it. While buses may travel around the ring of Kerry at certain times of the day, perhaps serving the larger towns, they do not serve rural areas such as Valencia Island or Ventry. In all the remote places in between, such as the Black Valley, to travel to Kenmare it can take three quarters of an hour of solid driving. While much of the driving may be in second or third gear, drivers must be on their marks to complete the journey safely because there are turns and bends. It is possible to make good time on the journey but there is no other way of getting into or out of such places. The same is true of the Pocket in Glenmore, which is so remote that it is two and a quarter hours from Cork city. It is nearly the same distance to Killarney or Tralee, to which people must travel if they want to do simple tasks such as renewing their driver licence. It is a day's work. The Minister of State is smiling but-----	spk_462
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-10-23	dail	32	Finance Bill 2019: Second Stage	dbsect_38	We will see. Tomorrow is another day. People are outraged by the increase because petrol and diesel are expensive enough. People do not agree it will have any beneficial effect on the climate because as many people know, the climate has changed throughout the ages and will continue to change when we are long gone. Whether there is carbon tax after our time, the weather will still change. We will still have extremes of weather in different ages or decades as we have throughout history. History has proved this. I wish to comment on the reality of diesel engines versus electric engines. A new Euro 6 engine emits 35% less CO2 per tonne than an electric car. That is the engine on a new articulated three-axle tractor unit with a three-axle trailer. Engines are so modern now and emit so much less carbon. It has been proven in tests that this engine emits 35% less CO2 than an electric car. There are still many questions about electric cars. For instance, how much carbon is emitted in the manufacture of the battery and its disposal when it is finished with? Its lifespan is supposed to be seven years but it may not last that long. Those batteries cost €7,000 to €8,000 to replace. The car is worth so much less before an owner even thinks of getting rid of it. An electric car's resale value is so much less than that of a diesel car. Diesel cars are now so efficient and streamlined. They emit much less than before. Farmers were hit again in this budget. The increase in stamp duty will affect any farmer who wants to buy an extra bit of land. As the Minister of State knows, a farmer cannot stand still; he or she must produce more. It is very hurtful to farmers that every year the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine returns money to the Exchequer. That is wrong. It should not be happening and we are very disappointed by it. Farmers are asking for simple things. They say it would be a good idea to give exporters €20 per head to help them to export cattle. If we do not continue to increase the export of cattle, we will play into the factories' hands. They are bad enough as it is. They are only paying €3.20 or €3.30 per kg. That is not good enough. Suckler farmers are on their knees. We have heard the television reports. There is proof that many more farmers will get out of the market and reduce the number of suckler cows. Despite throwing huge sums of money into health our country still has major deficiencies, for example, with regard to home help. The fair deal scheme has still not been sorted out for farmers. As far as farmers are concerned, it is a lousy deal. Just as with any other person, all that should be assessed is the value of a farmer's house. However, the Government still insists that the full value of the farm must be assessed as part of the fair deal scheme. That is totally undemocratic and unfair. Farmers feel they are paying for the fair deal for other people. Regarding housing, I asked again for the housing list income cap to be increased. People have been thrown off the housing list in Kerry when their income exceeded €33,600 per year. I am talking about a family with three children. That is wrong. The family income supplement puts the recipient over that limit. It is ridiculous that families who need social welfare to survive are being thrown off the housing list. It is totally unfair. Last week a damning Mental Health Commission report revealed major deficiencies in the level of mental healthcare provided to patients in Kerry. I will outline some key findings. Just two poorly staffed rehabilitation teams serve a population of 689,750 people in Cork and Kerry. The relevant health strategy, A Vision For Change, states that a minimum of seven is needed. While 70 nurses are required according to A Vision for Change, only six are available. Our mental health system in Kerry is not properly funded. Suicide figures have dropped nationwide but they have not dropped in Kerry. We have too much of it. People are hurt and families are torn apart by it. Like everyone else, I know there is no adequate mental health service in Kerry. I refer to the beds in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee. People are waiting on trolleys in the accident and emergency department. Beds have been closed in Dingle. Half of the beds in Kenmare community nursing unit are closed. Killarney Community Hospital is at capacity. We hope the new hospital will be built there in the near future. Pensioners were left behind in this budget. For as long as I can remember, there has always been some increase for pensioners, the old people who have served this country well. Only for them we would not be here. Many of them gave blood, sweat and tears to put food on the table and provide for their families. The Government found raising the carbon tax to be no bother in the world but old people were not given any increase. It is very unfair. I regret that the Government took this route with respect to elderly people who deserve better. They are really hurting because the Government did not give them the increase they were all genuinely hoping to get. It appears that the carbon tax will pay for redundancies and compensate workers at Bord na Móna in the middle of the country. That facility was an asset that was creating energy but the Government is closing it down and has flooded the bogs. Other options are open to the Government if it is serious about carbon. How many developers throughout the country have planning permission for solar panels but are waiting for a package that will pay them for providing energy?	spk_465

I thank the Taoiseach for apologising on behalf of the Government for the failures of the State and the health system which let down so many women, with their husbands, partners, children, parents, grandparents and siblings. I especially thank two women, Emma Mhic Mhathúna who has departed and Vicky Phelan who did so much to highlight the terrible wrong done to so many women. I hope this very public apology will in some way ensure something like this will never be allowed to happen again. When people get sick, they should receive the very best available care from the health service, but it is clear that this did not happen for many. That must change from now on. What happened to so many women and their families is very sad. It need not and should not have happened. I appeal to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the rest of the Government. They are the people on whom we depend to ensure the health service provides the required care for people when they get sick. When people are sick and vulnerable, the health service needs to kick into action and take care of them. It is clear that many aspects of the health service are letting people down and they have been let down. Emma Mhic Mhathúna who lived in Ballyferriter was let down, as were Vicky Phelan and so many others whose names I cannot remember. In many other aspects of the health service people are being let down. As Deputies, legislators and public representatives, with the Government, we need to ensure things like this will never happen again because when people are sick, that is the time they need care and are depending on us. I appeal to the Government to ensure nothing like this will ever be allowed to happen again.	spk_114

I thank Sinn Féin, and specifically Deputy Brady, for moving this motion. As we all know, what starts out as a loving relationship between a young couple can often turn sour even before the birth of a baby. A young person can find himself or herself in a predicament very quickly, with a happy-go-lucky life turned into something onerous and tough as he or she tries to raise a child on his or her own. We need to do whatever we can for lone parents, who do Trojan work raising their children and are so protective. We know that, in the early years especially, the mother cannot go out to work because she has to mind the baby. She needs every support. That is what the motion is concerned with, namely, ensuring that lone parents get the support to which they are entitled. Children are valuable. They are our future and we need to protect them. They are defenceless and cannot fend for themselves. In the cases in question, they are depending on a single parent. In many instances, there are not other family members to help. The grandparents are not around, for example, because they are too far away. A lone parent should not have thrown on him or her the requirement to prove legally the question of whether the other parent has the ability to pay. Proving that costs time and money, but lone parents do not have time when they are trying to mind their little babies and small children. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection should ensure that these lone parents are properly seen after. The one-parent family payment was cut a few years ago and has not been restored since. Many lone parents are struggling. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, not to oppose the motion. We must look after vulnerable young people, as they are our future.	spk_400

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-10-08	dail	32	Budget Statement 2020	dbsect_3	I am pleased to get the opportunity to speak on the budget. I got a clear message from 1,000 people on the budget and the economy of Kerry at Limerick racecourse last Sunday evening. It was to ask the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, to sign the hare coursing licence on which so many people in the south of the country, especially Kerry, Limerick and parts of Cork, depend. I ask the Government to sign the licence, which will cost it nothing. If it is not signed this week, it will be too late. We already had a carbon tax, which the Government has now increased. It is very clear that, by and large, this tax will have to be paid by the people of rural Ireland, such as the people of Kerry whom I represent. One cannot travel anywhere in County Kerry without a car. We have very little public transport. I have a message for another Minister, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on the one bit of public transport that we have. The ticket office in the bus station in Killarney is closed and people have nowhere to stand in out of the rain when waiting for a bus. There is no information centre now. There was a little shop but the woman who ran it retired last Saturday. The people of Killarney and visitors to the town no longer have a ticket office and they must get their ticket on the bus. That is totally unsatisfactory. I call on the Minister to wake up and to address the problem tomorrow and not the day after. We were told the carbon tax would be ring-fenced to help low-income people and to insulate their homes to improve energy efficiency. Now we are learning what the carbon tax is for. I do not begrudge the people of the midlands fair play or jobs but it is clear that this is to make up for the loss of jobs in Bord na Móna and the closure of the valuable power plants. They should not have been closed until the Government had something to replace them. We have been waiting for the Government to introduce a policy for solar energy farms. Many people have planning permission but there is no infrastructure in place to allow them to connect to the grid. Neither has any provision been made to pay people if they provide alternative energy. Other countries have hydroelectric schemes to provide electricity. We could utilise many of the streams and rivers in the country but the Government will not let us clear the rivers as it is. The question is where are we going. It is a fact that a diesel car is the most efficient and dependable one in which to travel. The Minister referred to providing more charging points and infrastructure around the country, but even if there are enough charging points, we will not have enough electricity because the Government is closing down the power plants and not making up the deficit in any real way. The people of rural Ireland especially will have to carry on in the meantime. They will have to go to work, take their children to school and do all the normal things and they need a reliable car. The suggestion that people should park all the diesel cars at this point and get electric cars is not on and is not workable at present. No recognition is given to the people who get up early in the morning. There was much talk about those who eat their dinner in the middle of the day. Many of them now do not have the time to eat any dinner but they must pay 52% tax. That is hurting many people. Many young people are complaining that there is no incentive to work hard as they are then asked to pay 52% tax. No recognition is given to those people in the budget. When it comes to health, more people than ever are on trolleys. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, we have hospitals in Kerry that are only half open. They include the hospitals in Kenmare and Dingle, while at the same time there are numerous people in beds and on trolleys, waiting to get a bed, in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee, yet no attempt is being made to fully open those hospitals. I have been asking for that since I came here four years ago and Deputy Michael Healy-Rae had being asking for it prior to that.As for home help, it is an absolute disgrace that people who served this country well and got us to where we are face such difficulties with accessing home help. People have been waiting since last May for home help hours. That is a shame and a downright disgrace. The members of this Government should hang their heads in shame for allowing that to happen. People have waiting for the chance to avail of the fair deal scheme so that they can progress to nursing homes. The Minister is really good at doing things that we do not want. To give one example, druggies have to be caught a third time before being arrested. The Minister initiated that policy and he ordered it on the spot while we were on holidays. That was no bother to him. It is a shame. The situation would be worse without the buses we take to Belfast. We have taken almost 1,000 people there now and the story is to go to Belfast or go blind. It is a bad reflection. One of the first men I took up to Belfast two years ago had been waiting for seven years. That man's grandfather had his cataracts removed in the hospital in Tralee in 1968.  Turning to social welfare, there has been no rise for old age pensioners. Again, those are the very people who got us where we are today. Everything else, such as fuel, is going up in price. It has been stated that the price of home heating oil will not be affected until May 2020. The old-age pensioners, however, are not going to get the €5 rise in their pensions to which so many of them had been looking forward. They depend on it greatly as they do not have any other income. They are very protective of the pension and many of them will be very hurt at the lack of an increase in the payment. I welcome the increase in the income qualification cap for medical cards for those aged over 70. Another group of pensioners, however, also qualify for that payment at the age of 66. Many of those people, up to the age of 70, do get sick unfortunately and they need a medical card as well. The income threshold for that group has not risen at all. It is unfair that those people who worked so hard will not qualify for a medical card. I also requested one other small thing several times, which is that when a medical card is granted, it should be effective from the date of application. That is not happening. I am asking for that measure because many people in rural Ireland do not make any provision for their health until they actually get sick. Turning to agriculture, after all that has happened and all the protests, there has been no recognition of the problems of the suckler and beef farmers. At present, they are not even covering their costs. The increase in the diesel price will hurt them even more. The increase in the stamp duty is also a shame. IBEC has been telling us that we have the lowest level of capital infrastructural projects. Access into our county of Kerry is strangled because of the delay with the Macroom-Ballyvourney bypass, as well as the Killarney bypass. We need those projects to keep the movement-----	spk_155

It is very hard to place an extra cost on people who have to smoke. There are many elderly people who were smoking before any education was available on the effects of cigarettes and it is impossible for them to give up now. This increase will not encourage them to stop and it is not the way to go. It should be education, education and education. I do not like smoking myself and it hurts to see young people doing it. However, this is not the way to go. Tobacco is expensive enough as it is and pensioners got no rise in the budget. As such, this is very unfair. My views on carbon taxes are well known. There was already a carbon tax on fuel. Diesel is now going up to €1.50 a litre, which is an excessive cost that people will not be able to bear. Working people and people in rural Ireland have no other way to travel but by car or the SUVs that farmers need so much. There is no sound alternative at present. As such, I will call for divisions on both resolutions.	spk_183

We all know that for farmers to continue to exist they must invariably buy a bit of land to increase production and stay in the race. For that reason, I oppose Financial Resolution No. 4. It would also affect young people buying a site from a farmer or landowner. In addition, it would affect developers buying a larger site to build more houses. All that would happen then is that the price of the house would increase to the young man or woman who wishes to buy a house to make a home for themselves. I am opposed to the measure. Likewise, I am not happy with Financial Resolution No. 3. We all know the banks were bailed out by the people of this country and they seem to be getting away lightly.

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-10-03	dail	32	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_15	I highlight the lack of vital infrastructure projects in County Kerry. We have been waiting for many years for these projects, despite promises year after year. The village of Kilcummin has been waiting at least 15 years. A project was promised several times but the road to the village has been delayed for at least ten years because we have been told repeatedly that the sewerage scheme will be constructed the following year. Scartaglen was third in line for a project back in 2008. The village does not have a sewerage treatment plant and nor does Currow. The county council is drawing sewage in Currow into an old tank and bringing it to the treatment plant in Killarney. Castlecove, beside the sea, has no treatment plant either and nor do the towns and villages of Caherdaniel, Kilmoyley, Knockanure, Cromane, Beaufort and Currans. We are also waiting for sewerage plants to be upgraded, including the one in Kenmare. It is possible to get planning permission to build a house in the town, but then it is stated that commencement of the building work will have to wait until the sewerage treatment plant has been upgraded. Similar treatment plants in Glenbeigh, Abbeydorney, which is in a shocking state, Kilflynn and Rossbeigh also need to be upgraded. Castleisland, meanwhile, has been waiting for an extension to the sewer for 33 years. One third of the town is not connected to the sewer. That is the honest truth. In the kind of weather we are experiencing now, people with septic tanks have to empty them once a month. The rural water programme was to be put in place to bring us from 2019 to 2022. We are still waiting for that to happen and this year is nearly gone. A contractor is in place in Glenflesk, finally, but we are waiting for approval from the Minister's Department to sanction the €1.3 million needed for the project to progress. When we put all of those projects on a list, it is shocking to see the way that Kerry has been let down over the years. This involves the Government and Irish Water, but the commitment needs to come from the Government. There is a Minister with responsibility for the environment and we are talking about the environment and protecting it every day. Kerry has been let down in this regard. Many of the villages I named are falling down because they cannot expand. It is not possible to get planning permission. Scartaglen, a grand village in the middle of everywhere, is zoned but people cannot get planning permission for a development there because there is no public sewerage system. I ask the Tánaiste to do something about this situation. 	spk_105

Irish Water will state that it is only obliged to bring its existing treatment plants up to an acceptable standard. The company will tell me, others and the local authority that it has no obligation to build new treatment plants. That is where we are. I ask the Tánaiste to talk to Irish Water about that. He is the Tánaiste of the country and Deputy Eoghan Murphy is the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. How are people in places like Kilcummin, Scartaglen and all of the places I named previously going to prosper? How are they going to build houses if there are no sewage treatment plants? That is a fact. Caherdaniel and Castlecove welcome thousands of tourists every year. Tourism is the only business in the area and these places do have not have treatment plants. The local authority tells us that there is no obligation to build new treatment plants, only an obligation to bring the ones in place up to an acceptable standard. At the same time, the plants in Kenmare, Glenbeigh and even Killarney need to be upgraded. There is a lack of funding and a lack of will to ensure the provision of vital infrastructure that is so badly needed in our county.	spk_114

I compliment Deputy O'Callaghan on bringing it forward. We hear every day of knife crime and it is on the increase. We have to ask ourselves why. Many believe that it is because of drugs and that it is used by these villains who supply and are in command of drugs and who are destroying our communities. We hear so much of it every day. I know it will be difficult for the Garda to apprehend these fellows. I believe now it is coming close to the time when the gardaí themselves have to be armed because the criminals going around now are getting more serious and are more dangerous. There seems to be more of them. In that regard, we must have ways of dealing with them and, when these fellows are apprehended, it should not be deemed to be a minor offence if they are found with dangerous knives. I was listening to the previous speakers about fellows having knives and I can tell them that my father always carried a pen knife that was certainly well edged and if he gave it to one of us he would be looking for it back. I can honestly say that for most of the time he was here he had a small pen knife in his coat pocket because he was used to having it, and would have had it at all times in his pocket. To go back to the serious aspect of knife crime, there is more of it and it is timely that we do something about it. We all support Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill and hope good will come of it because we need to protect our citizens; that is one of the reasons we are here.	spk_368

As we know, the secretaries are out of sorts because they are not being paid properly. It is not fair because they do a tremendous job. I met the school secretary in Kilgarvan recently when I drove the school bus because my bus driver was off. I saw that her job involves ensuring that children are loaded onto and unloaded from the buses. When we took in the buses, she closed the school gate so that no child would go out past the gate. They are primarily responsible for the safety of the children. It is a fair responsibility to be entrusted with the safety of another person's child. They have to be Garda vetted, and they have to be correct in every way, because this onus of responsibility is upon them. As other Deputies stated, school secretaries are the point of contact between parents and teachers. They are there for the enrolling of the children. They are there at every request. They are very important. They play a very important role. When we hear that some secretaries are paid directly by the State, it strikes us that it is time for all of them to be recognised. The teachers are taken up with teaching duties. There may have been a time when things were not as intense and principals had time to deal with things, but now we need a secretary in every school for the safety of children and all that goes with it. We have to be grateful for the tremendous job they do. Parents, bus drivers and teachers realise that they cannot carry on without secretaries. I support the school secretaries.	spk_400
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-10-02	dail	32	UN Climate Action Summit: Statements	dbsect_29	I am sorry that I do not agree with anything that has been said here tonight. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, admits that climate change occurs because of changes in the Earth's solar orbit and not because of human activity. For more than 60 years, NASA has known that changes occurring to the planetary weather patterns are completely natural and normal. The space agency has, for whatever reason, chosen to let the man-made global warming hoax persist and spread to the detriment of human freedom. Farmers who have cattle were supposed to be causing massive methane gas emissions. Now the very professor who told us that 15 years ago is admitting that he exaggerated by two thirds. In yesterday's NASA papers, this was highlighted, and it was referred to in a television programme yesterday. At times, the Earth is 5 million km closer to the sun than at other times and that is what causes the dramatic changes in our temperature and weather. At different tilts, the Earth's seasons become much more extreme while at lower tilts, they become much milder. If we had to sum the whole thing up in one simple phrase, it would be that the biggest factor influencing weather and climate patterns on Earth is the sun. Depending on the position of the Earth and the sun at any given time, climate conditions will vary dramatically and even create drastic abnormalities that defy everything that humans thought they knew about how the Earth worked. There was a lot of talk about history yesterday evening and we are glad that the Minister for Education and Skills will listen to people who wanted history to remain as a core subject for the junior certificate, but if we go back in history, the weather changed dramatically at different times. The 1730s was the wettest decade in history. In the 1740s, two years of incessant rain resulted in a famine that caused more than a third of Ireland's population to die. There was a heavy snowfall in 1917, when it snowed for two months, with up to 52 mm even in Cork. There was severe flooding in Dublin in 1802 and the big wind in 1839, which blew most of the country asunder. Before the Famine in the 1840s, there was unusually wet weather. In 1903, there was a very severe storm during which 2,000 trees were uprooted in Birr, 4,000 in Kilkenny and 2,000 in the Phoenix Park. In October 1927, nine fishermen were lost off Mayo in a storm and ten more were lost off Galway.	spk_439

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-10-02	dail	32	Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019: Second Stage	dbsect_32	This Bill focuses on a number of things. It would enable the broadcasting authority to impose, reduce, and in some cases eliminate or exempt the payment of the broadcasting levy by certain broadcasters. I am worried because we do not know what charge will be imposed. It refers to providing flexibility to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in dealing with the application of the broadcasting levy and introducing a new broadcasting funding scheme administered by the authority. It is very broad and we are not sure what it will constitute or how it will be meted out to the people who will be asked to pay. I am repeating what has been said to me all around my constituency. People are very dissatisfied with what RTÉ 1 and RTÉ 2 are producing for the fee they have to pay. TG4 appears to be the only station that satisfies a lot of people's requirements. People can watch matches and see the Fleadh Cheoil and other things of interest to people in rural Ireland. Current affairs and news on RTÉ 1 and RTÉ 2 are very good but many of the lighter programmes are repetitive and viewers are sick of them, having seen them hundreds of times, so they turn off the television. I am worried how the local radio stations in Kerry and around the country will fare under the new levies. They have to be supported because if it were not for Radio Kerry in the morning, people would not know if their neighbours were dead. The Road Traffic Act was imposed here by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and his supporters, as well as by those who abstained. Many people are isolated in their homes and cannot even go to the pub for one pint so they stay at home. Everyone listens to Radio Kerry attentively to see who is on the list of people who pass away. People like to go to funerals but they will miss these too, and there is no going to the creamery now and there are no local shops. Most of the post offices are closed as well as the Garda stations, and there is no interaction in rural Ireland any more. Radio Kerry has a great current affairs programme from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. five days per week, with Treasa and Jerry who keep abreast of everything that happens locally and nationally. The service is invaluable. We have entertainment programmes such as Dermot Moriarty's country music show and there is a fairly full schedule from early in the morning to late at night, which provides entertainment for people of all ages. We have Danny O'Mahony with Irish music. It has been a revelation since its inception. We had a great sports commentator, Weeshie Fogarty, who was known countywide, nationally and internationally. He was a famous man who did great work for Kerry and the GAA and all sports in the country. He will be remembered forever even though he has gone now. We have new people like Timmy Moynihan, Ambrose O'Donovan and Billy O'Shea, who are doing great work in the GAA.If not for that great radio station, many people would be very lonely in rural parts of Kerry. It is getting better and better and deserves credit and any support that we can give it. It is not getting money from licences, as I understand it, but it needs support because it is in competition with RTÉ. Even then, it is keeping the flag flying in Kerry and is doing a great job which we are all very proud of. I am concerned that this Bill is like writing a blank cheque for this regulator. My experience of regulators has not been good. Any of the regulators we know of that were supposed to do a job did not do it right. In one case, they left the country to go down the Swanee with what happened with financial institutions in our country. This Bill is very broad. I cannot see that I can support this Bill until we get clarification and detail as to what people will be asked to pay. Will it be an addendum to the current television licence? Will it be instead of the television licence? That is what we were told for a while. We do not know what the charge will be. As I said already, people have a problem with what they are paying for at present. People pay when they are getting value for money but if they are not getting value for money, they are slow to pay. People I represent tell me that a good deal of what is shown on RTÉ at present is not up to much. They are not happy and there is not enough modern, current content on it which would interest most people. The current affairs and the news are very good and have to be supported. We thank it for the great job it is doing on those.	spk_506

I thank the Minister for restoring history as a core subject on the junior curriculum. When will this happen? When will it be reintroduced? Will geography be restored as a core subject as well? This is a very important matter because, as many have said, if we do not know our history or how we got here, how do we know who we are? Then we need to know geography to find out where we are going. It is very important. The removal of history as a core subject would have been a very sinister move because it would have broken up our heritage, our culture and our identity. We have a great history, and our forefathers were great people. I refer to the people who got us to where we are today and all the generations since, as well as all the people who fought and died for our freedom and the people who tried over the centuries and ages to rid us of the shackles of another country. We fought for 800 years. That is all nice for the young people coming up to know: how we arrived here and how we got our democracy and our freedom. It is also nice for other youngsters to know. We now have children of many denominations coming into our country. They need to know the country they are in and how we got to where we are. This is important for them as well. Likewise, it is very important our children know about European and international history. That is a great starting point. I know that the NCCA set up this initiative under the Minister's colleague, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, but it was absolutely ridiculous to suggest that history should not be a core subject. Why would we educate teachers to teach history if they would not have classes to teach? It was absolutely ridiculous to listen to anyone calling for it not to be a core subject anymore. This is a forward step back to what we had. History was on the curriculum for years and years. It did not make any sense to remove it. I applaud the Minister for not doing so.

I have no grudge against anyone in farms being planted with a grove or a hedge. Indeed, I have done it myself. As has been said, farmers have always been doing it. Where I come from, everywhere anyone looks there are too many trees and bushes and they are growing. There are plenty of them in our neck of the woods. Despite talk about paying farmers to do it, everyone in this House knows that that is not going to happen any time soon. For years we have been asking for a grant for the planting of trees on marginal land, but it has been refused. The Government has refused it and there is no hope it will change its mind any time soon. That is the truth of the matter. It is galling to think farmers are not getting a fair price for their cattle. There was a lot of talk about Mercosur and we know what is happening in South America, where trees are being cut down. We have been asked by the man in Europe, Mr. Hogan, to plant trees and get rid of some of our cattle. It is emotive to talk to farmers tonight and tell them that it is advisable to plant trees. They know the amount they can plant on their land. If they have a small farm, they will do so much and if they have a bigger farm, they will do a bit more. However, despite being told that they are going to be paid to do it, I do not believe it. Today, yesterday and every other day, we have been asking the Government to pay for home helps, but it does not have the money to pay for the home help or the fair deal scheme. Therefore, from where is it going to get the money to pay farmers to plant more trees? That is the honest truth. Do not cod the people because they are not to be codded anymore. They know what the Government is at and that it is only talk. There is all this talk about climate change and there are parties tripping over each other in this House to see which of them will be as green as the Greens, or greener if they could be. There was a professor who stated 15 years ago that cows were creating a savage amount of methane gas. Three weeks ago he admitted that he was wrong and that they were not actually creating one third of what he had claimed. NASA admits that climate change occurs because of changes in the Earth's solar orbit, as the distance between the sun and the Earth increases and decreases at times.That is the cause of climate change, not the poor farmer-----	spk_393

For many parents, it is traumatic to find out about these needs for the first time. From that point on, they want to do the best they can for those children. We need to assist them in any way we can. Given the small amounts of money involved, we should not be penny-pinching in providing funding for children with autism and their education. Many parents lack support when their children are first diagnosed. It is vital that we support them when they find out for the first time that their child has a little problem. I have very little time. There is still a delay in the provision of home tuition hours. We are now in the third week in September. That is not satisfactory, and I would like the Minister of State to deal with that. That cannot be allowed to happen because continuity is very important for these children. If there is a delay and they are left behind for even a short while, they will go back to where they were again. In that regard, we should be making provision in July for children with Down's syndrome as well as all the other children with intellectual disabilities. We are not doing that at present, and that is very unfair on these children. That group of children should be entitled to July provision as well. That is very important.  Moreover, we make no provision at all for children when they reach the age of 18. From that point on we do not assist parents who are sometimes very elderly and do not know where their child will end up. We are doing nothing at all in that regard. In our county, we are left totally behind. 	spk_230

Despite that, it is almost certain that he is going to increase the carbon tax.Does the Minister have any comprehension of how it will affect people in rural Ireland? I refer to people living in remote areas who need their car. It will already cost them €4.50 extra to fill their car before the carbon tax is increased at all. Does the Minister have any idea that such people need their cars to go to work, to take their children to school, and to travel to doctor's appointments and hospitals? It will affect hauliers throughout the country and farmers who need their tractors. Does the Minister have any idea how the measure will hurt people and does he realise the price of home heating oil already has increased, before putting it up even further? It will affect the elderly, who we believe will receive no increase in their pension this year. How much more misery will the Government inflict on people in rural Ireland?	spk_68
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-09-24	dail	32	Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Bill 2019: Second Stage	dbsect_32	I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute on this important topic. I, too, am unhappy with the appointment of another regulator and another group of people who will be appointed by the Minister of the day.There is enough officialdom as it is if those people woke up and gave funding to local authorities to build the houses. What difference will it make to have another regulator appointed by the Government? The regulator will have to revert to the Government for approval to release funding in any case. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government demands a four-stage process when a project goes over €2 million and one would not build even eight houses for that now with all the new regulations. I do not approve of this. For almost two years I have spoken about how the Government is blocking the tenant purchase scheme, which allows people to buy their houses after living for 30 or 40 years in them. Pensioners who have come into money are not allowed to purchase their houses despite giving 30 or 40 years to renting and maintaining a house to a high standard. They are blocked from buying those houses, which is very wrong. The money used to, in turn, go back to the local authority to refurbish voids and bring them back into circulation. We now have a problem with the number of voids in Kerry and it is taking too long to turn them around. I believe the authorities when they say they do not have the required funding. What is wrong with the Government? We were told in 2015 we would get €65 million. There was much hullabaloo from the Government at the time that Kerry was getting €65 million for housing but I can tell the House we have nowhere near even a quarter of that drawn down four years later because we are being stifled by the Department and its four-stage process. There is no order in what is going on. There is much comment about landlords blackguarding tenants or charging too much rent. Most landlords are paying 52% of the money they receive in rent to the Government's coffers again. If the Government wants to do something about the amount of rent charged, it will have to do something about the amount of tax being taken from landlords. There are many good landlords and only a small minority does not comply with anything. Landlords are getting out of the game because the system is so much against them. In Kerry, there are approximately 55 applicants on the local authority list for rural cottages and we will be lucky if 12 will be built between 2016 and 2021. That is equivalent to 12 houses in five years in all County Kerry, which is not good enough. The sites are provided and all we are asking for is the funding to build the houses. We are not getting it and I believe the local authority when it says it is not getting that funding. One rural cottage that has been built has no chimney, which is ridiculous, as it is in an area with turf all around it. The people will not be able to burn one sod of turf because there is no chimney in the house.	spk_215

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-09-24	dail	32	Agrifood and Rural Development: Motion	dbsect_33	I ask that the clock be wound back. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the farming situation, particularly in rural areas such as those in County Kerry. As my colleagues and I understand it, rural Ireland depends on suckler farmers and hillside sheep farmers. In recent times, particularly the past two or three years, things have been getting worse for suckler farmers to the extent that they are not making ends meet. They are losing money. Suckler farmers have stated that they will cut down the number in their herds in spite of all the effort they have put in through the years because they cannot carry on. They meet all environmental standards and abide by every rule and regulation, but they are not being paid a fair price. The factories are nailing them to the cross while the retailers get away scot-free. In the past three months there was little discussion of the role of retailers as most attention was rightly focused on the factories.We will also have to focus on the retailers. The farmers are the only ones who are still not being paid properly. We are all glad that the strike has been stood down as this is the time of year when most beef cattle go into the factories; they are fat at this time of year and have reached the 13 months. Many farmers were held up so it is good that it has been stood down for the time being but nothing has happened to the base price and I am worried that nothing will. I believe the farmers will be back at the factory gates in the not too distant future. I hope that I am wrong but I cannot see what will change. They are not even answering to the producer organisations, and if they are not doing it now after the pressure that was put on them, they will not in time. Farmers must take all the risks, from breeding the proper calf to staying out all night to pull calves out until the calving season is over. One can see that farmers are physically in poorer condition after the calving season given the time and effort they put in. There is the cost of fertilisers and paying contractors for silage. So many people in rural communities depend on farmers, from the shopkeeper, the person with the filling station and the fellows who deliver the oil. They all live off the farmer and if the farmer goes bad, they will go bad shortly after. That is how it is now. Many farmers are under severe financial pressure. We met so many at the gates who are in trouble paying college fees for their children who had returned to college some weeks earlier. Back in 2004, when I was not long in Kerry County Council, it tabled a motion to watch the monopoly which was being created by the great supermarket bodies. The motion said they were dictating what the farmer would be paid and that they would dictate what the customer would pay. They have ensured they have a monopoly. I heard at the gates where the protests were held that Aldi and Lidl have exacerbated the price issue. The prices to the farmers are reduced all the time but we never see the price of meat on the shelves reduce. I hope that the Minister of State is listening. Regardless of what happens, when the farmer gets a bad price that is not reflected in a low price on the shelves in the Lidls or Aldis. The farmers were looking for the abolition of the four movement rule. If a carcase is hanging, no human could say how many times that carcass had moved. That rule is wrong and should be removed. The 70-day retention period should be reduced to 21 days. That was not acceded to. The 30-month rule makes no sense at all. The farmers were asking that this would be increased to 36 months. That has not happened. They are getting nothing at all for the fifth quarter and the factories are being paid handsomely for that. They are getting at least €200 per head for the fifth quarter while the farmer gets nothing. However, it is the base price which is what the farmers are asking for. The factories must give a base price and if they do not we will be back at the gates in a very short time.	spk_231

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-09-18	dail	32	Agriculture: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_27	I thank Deputy Eamon Ryan for sharing time and Fianna Fáil for bringing this motion forward, which I am supporting. The Ministers did not listen to us in the spring when we were highlighting the plight of the farmers and I do not know if they really care. I am very disappointed with the Tánaiste, who was only 20 minutes away from the gates in Bandon but he never arrived to listen to the farmers. The same applies to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, each of whom were no more than 20 minutes away from the gates in Bandon. We, and the people there, are very disappointed with that. Farmers rang me last night. There is no mention of €3.60. The figure of €3.40 is the going rate. What farmers really need and want is €4 but they would accept and could live with €3.80. A fortnight ago, they were offered €3.20. I could get the man who told me that on the phone this minute. That is not fair or right. Why can the factories not accept a little less profit? It was in the newspaper that one processing plant made €190 million last year in profits. Why could it not accept half of that and give something to the farmers to allow them to continue working the land they love and on which generations before them prided themselves and on which they survived? Why could it not take a bit less? One individual is worth €480 million. The west of Ireland and every farmer there could not make up €480 million even if they all joined together with whatever small bank accounts they have. The whole thing is wrong and unfair and is the height of blackguarding. Something better than this deal will have to be put in place to sort this out. I realise people owe money. They want to give money to their children who are going to college but they have bills to pay and need to get money somewhere. The situation is desperate. The Ministers and their Government have let the farmers in the west of Ireland down, including in the county of Kerry.	spk_334
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-09-18	dail	32	Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union: Statements	dbsect_30	I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute because this matter concerns and worries so many people all around County Kerry and the country. Whatever way England leaves, if it does indeed eventually leave, Ireland will not be as good a place to trade or to live because things will never be as good again as they have been under the regime that we have had for many years. There is already considerable worry and concern that our economy will slow down and that it will affect agriculture, tourism, haulage, small businesses and exports. They have no idea how tariffs will affect them or how we will get our agriproducts out of the country. Will there be tariffs when going through what we call the landbridge of England? What costs will there be? We are an island country and everything we export to Europe has to go through or else around England. It will be a greater cost and a significant inconvenience for hauliers not to be able to go through England. They are very concerned and are asking me what rates they will have to pay. Is that being ironed out at present? If the UK leaves, as it insists it will, with Mr. Johnson being prepared to leave at any cost on 31 October whether he has his clothes on or off, it will have a severe impact on things that people are maybe not thinking about at all. Will hauliers need one or two drivers to get from here to Germany? Will they need three drivers if they are going to places such as Finland or eastern Europe? They are asking all those kinds of questions. The hauliers will have to shoulder the extra burden and cost and they are concerned about it. We appreciate all the work that the Government is doing and it has the support of the House to do its bit for Ireland. Many people are confused when they hear the Taoiseach saying there will have to be Border checks while the Minister, Deputy Coveney, says there will be no Border checks, though he supplements it by saying that they will not be near the Border, anyway. What does that mean? People need clarification about that. The British Parliament has said that it does not want to go without a deal. What is the deal? It is clear that it does not want the backstop. What else does it want or not want? If we went to the fair in Kenmare long ago with bullocks, when we went to the top of the town, we knew what we wanted for the animals. We did not go in hoping for some fellow to say what he would give us. One had to know what one wanted. It is not clear that the UK knows what it wants. It will affect agriculture, tourism, haulage, small business and everything, and we are all concerned about it.	spk_398

I went to the ploughing championships today. It was a grand sight on a fine day. I met grand people from all over the country, especially Kerry. Every manufacturer and supplier that was at the championships today is dependent on the farmer. We are at a crossroads. I have raised this issue with the Minister and Taoiseach since early last year and throughout this year. These farmers cannot continue to operate at a loss. The deal that went through in the past few days is not satisfactory because it is not going to affect the base price.As Deputy Fitzmaurice stated, €3.40 or €3.60 is not good enough. The Minister is as good at mathematics as anyone else. It will not work. We looked for different things. The 70-day rule, which was a ministerial or departmental rule, was brought in on foot of BSE. Why can it not be got rid of now? The Minister is shaking his head but it is a fact that BSE is no longer an issue. There is no foot and mouth disease now. I am talking about the 30-month rule. An extra six months would mean that the cattle could be fed in grass and finished in grass and the farmers would get a little bit more out of them, but that is not what is happening. That was not adhered to. On the four-movement rule, if a carcase is hanging in a plant, can any man or woman tell me how many times it has been moved? It is ridiculous, yet if the CAP states that the animal has moved more than four times, the farmer is going to be paying. Like everyone else, I love my bit of land. I bought it 25 years ago. Farmers are trying to stay on their land and continue with their activities but they are not being treated fairly by the factories. I thank all the people who stood at the gates for the past number of weeks in order to highlight the blackguarding of the farmers. They gave of their time unselfishly. I thank the Beef Plan Movement for arranging all the meetings in Cahirciveen, Bantry, Castleisland, Listowel and Kenmare and at all the mart venues throughout County Kerry where farmers came to highlight the situation. They did not go there in the dark winter for fun. They are not being paid fairly, and all they want is a fair price. It is sad that the Taoiseach stated he is doing his bit to reduce carbon emissions by not eating meat. That compounded the despondency among farmers and it is a sad reflection on the Taoiseach. We then had more people suggesting that we should increase our global carbon emissions targets to hurt farmers more. We know that oil is already dear enough and it is to increase because of something that is happening in Iran. When we talk about Iran-----	spk_353

It is important that we keep our islands on the agenda for improvement. It is sad that numbers are declining all the time on the islands that are still inhabited, despite the fact that we have more modern means of transport and better ways of getting on and off these islands. That is the trend and, as was mentioned already, peninsulas such as the Iveragh Peninsula are suffering a decline in population because we cannot get work or job opportunities for people in such places. The same applies to the islands. The only future for the Blasket Islands and smaller islands such as Rossdohan and Rossmore is by developing the tourism product. I am personally familiar with Rossdohan Island, where there is an old castle that was very modern in its time. When one stands in that castle, one can see all the way up to the suspension bridge in Kenmare. There is a future there if tourism is enhanced and developed to ensure the island does not go into further decline. I am disappointed to relay what happened in Valentia Island this year. Two area plans, which spanned 12 years, zoned a little section on the island as residential. Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae proposed that it be zoned as residential again in the most recent area plan for south Kerry. The council all voted for it but, lo and behold, the planning regulator arrived down from Dublin and threatened all kinds of action. Despite it being proposed again by Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae, the rest of the council decided it was safer not to vote for the area to be zoned as residential again. For the 12 years it was zoned as residential, only two houses were built in it but it has now been ensured that no house will be built in this little plot of ground. That is wrong because if one cannot build a house for people, how can any place be sustained? We are very proud that Mr. Mick O'Connell, who hailed from that great island, Valentia Island, is still hale and hearty and he fully supported the zoning of this area and he would not want anything bad to happen to the place in which he was born and raised and lived all his life. It is sad to think that, despite his wishes and those of many other locals, the planning regulator got his way, the land is de-zoned and no houses will be built. My brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, and I also sought funding for a new ferry service for that island. That has not been forthcoming from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. He has done much harm to rural Ireland but he would not even do that bit of good to provide the funding for that small request for a new ferry.	spk_410

They are very angry. They are already squeezed by the factories and if Brexit happens, they know they will be squeezed further. It is outlandish to think the Government is considering a deal with Mercosur when it complies with no rules and regulations. The animals are not tagged or anything. There is foot and mouth disease in those countries. Against this we can see how all farmers here for at least 20 years have gone through every hoop and met the highest standards. There are inspections every day and Department vets are on top of them. They comply with every regulation so it is outlandish to think we could even consider this deal.It is of no benefit to the people of rural Ireland, the small farmers and the decent people from Kerry and all over the country who came to protest outside the gates of Leinster House today. Why would the Government even consider it when it is of no benefit to those people? It will hurt them, drive them into the ground and finish them. All those people want to do is to continue what their fathers did before them, to carry that on and hand the farm down to the generation following them in a slightly better condition. This Government has not helped farmers with the factories and is going to hurt them further by even entertaining this agreement. This deal is with a crowd from South America that are complying with no rules and regulations. They are breaking every rule in the book. Commissioner Hogan had a cheek to ask Ireland to cut down production and plant more land when hundreds of acres are being cut down every day. Back in 2013, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, told farmers to increase production. What kind of a crowd is the Government?

Early assessment of needs is vital. Many families cannot afford to pay for this themselves, are on the public waiting list and have to wait too long. The longer the children are without assistance, their needs increase, especially for autistic children. The July provision is very helpful for autistic children when they are off school. It allows them to develop social skills. Routine is very important for these children. It provides an opportunity for respite for the parents. I hope the Minister of State or someone is listening to me because it is very important. Children with Down's syndrome are being excluded from the July provision, for which they should qualify. It is important for the Government to seek to redress this very sad deficit because these children need assistance and would benefit greatly from the July provision. Another area of concern for many parents and students is where schools apply to the State Examination Commission for reasonable accommodation for students sitting their junior certificate or leaving certificate examinations and who need a scribe or a reader. Why is the Department cutting back on these reasonable accommodations? The schools are finding it very difficult to get these reasonable accommodations, especially for children with dyslexia or dyspraxia who are suffering because of the Government cutbacks. I am asking the Minister of State to do something about this. It is good to have the opportunity this evening to ask him for this. There is another idea that is being used in Kerry. The South Kerry Partnership has developed a very important model for children and people who have a deficit and are not fully physically or mentally well. They can benefit from social farming. Children and teenagers are taken out to a farm by farmers who are committed to this and get a few bob for it.It is very good for children and many of them would benefit from nature, seeing what happens when a sheep has a lamb or a cow having a calf, and all that happens on a farm. It is a wonderful idea. It is being developed by South Kerry Partnership and I am asking the Minister of State to explore this because it would help many families.	spk_688

They are very angry. They are on their knees and have been for all of this year and a good part of last year. Today, the factories will not even take beef. The farmers have to wait 30 days for the factories to accept animals. The Minister knows how much that is costing. Farmers are in a trap or vice because of Brexit, the Mercosur deal and the activities of the factories. They are facing extinction. The Government is suggesting that there is some good in this deal, but there is no good at all in it for farmers in rural areas, including the area between the Minister's home town and the county bounds.From the county bound back to Slea Head, Valentia Island, through Kenmare, Sneem and Cahirciveen, and on the other side of Kenmare Bay in Bonane and Lauragh, they are predominantly beef and suckler farmers. They are facing a wipe-out if the Minister does this and allows beef in from South America where they are cutting down the rainforest. Commissioner Hogan and, I believe, the Minister mentioned that farmers must cut production and plant forestry. Forestry will wipe out the rural communities forever because when 1 acre or 100 acres is planted there is no life in that side of the country. To think that the Minister is even dreaming of doing this is terrible. The Government is already making farmers feel guilty for producing beef. The Taoiseach has said he is doing his bit to reduce the carbon footprint. We can prove that our animals are reared in green grass up to their eyes. In Brazil and Argentina they have humps on them and are in dirty dusty yards with troughs around them. We are doing it the right way. 	spk_94

I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on this important subject. We all know too many people, young and old, who have lost their lives due to severe mental health problems and suicide. I believe that the HSE and the Department of Health are not at the races at all in delivering a proper service. I compliment the staff working in the services, however. They are working to the best of their ability amid the constraints of the environment with which they have to deal. It is very clear that when an unfortunate person presents at the weekend, in many instances there is no assistance available and that person is then sent home. That has resulted in the loss of lives and that is not good enough. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae stated, youngsters from the age of 13 or 14 up to the age of 22 or 23 should not be treated as adults or put into a ward with adults who have a long history of mental health problems. It is wrong to put those youngsters into that environment. We should be striving to get away from that situation. All of our hospitals should be examined and new systems put in place to deal with these scenarios. Some of these young people need one-to-one professional care and to talk with trained psychiatrists. Invariably, those services are not readily enough available. Instead, sedation may be used and that is not good enough. I have gone into someone else's time.	spk_504

There were two parts to the project when it was first put before the members of Kerry County Council. The first part runs from Lissivigeen to beyond Farranfore on the N22. It is to run from Lissivigeen to Castlelough on the Muckross road on the N70. It is a vital project which will reduce pressure and the number of accidents from Lissivigeen to beyond Farranfore. There have been many fatalities at Coolcaslagh, Ballycasheen, the top of Lewis road, Madam's Hill and the Four Roads junction in Farranfore village. At the last count, on the current bypass which is not sufficient, an estimated 18,600 vehicles passed by daily. It is probably higher now. The road links the Ring of Kerry, the Killorglin road and the Cork to Tralee road. The other leg will run from Lissivigeen to Castlelough to avoid the need for traffic from Kenmare and the Ring of Kerry to pass through the heart of Killarney town. All of the traffic heading to other parts of the country would not have to use the Muckross road. It would also mean that all of the traffic, the thousands of cars heading to Muckross House and Gardens and the national park would not have to pass through Killarney town and clog it up. The Muckross road, the town, Mission road and Dr. Hans Liebherr Road become parking lots at certain times of the day because traffic cannot move. On the one hand, it is good that we have this traffic into Killarney town which is the tourist capital of Ireland and where the tourism operators are second to none. However, they need assistance at this stage to ensure their product will not be diminished by visitors complaining about being held up in traffic.This project was first put in front of us in 2004. In 2017 I raised it and we got €50,000 just to dust down the files. We got €500,000 this year to carry out further studies and preparatory work. I am asking the Tánaiste to commit to ensuring this project is included in the coming year's capital investment programme. 	spk_144

I thank my brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, for assisting to arrange these tributes and Deputy Mattie McGrath, the leader of our group, who spoke at the Business Committee about the matter. I thank all of the Members who spoke in such glowing terms for their praise for our father. It was clear from their intimate knowledge of the things he had done and said that those who spoke knew him very well. It is great to be here.  I express special thanks to everyone from County Kerry who travelled to be with us. My father always had the best people around him. It is quite something to think it is 22 years ago to the very day when he first took his seat in the Dáil. It is unbelievable to have these tributes being paid to him today. A lot of those who are here were here on that day too and I must thank them also. I refer to John Donoghue, Tim Coffey, Timmie O, Richie Mc, Tim Herlihy, John O'Connor, Seamus Doherty, Pat Moriarty, Noel Lucey, Brendan Hartnett, Derry Healy, Kevin Tarrant, Mike and Sean Dunne, Mike Galvin, Ruairi and James Doherty, James's partner Kathleen Cahill, Liam Fitzgerald and Noreen O'Sullivan who nursed my father when he was sick.  I must also mention the other great people who did so much for him, albeit it is dangerous to mention particular people, given the risk that I will leave someone out. There are people who cannot be here, including Dan Dawn McCarthy, Connie Doherty and the O'Donoghue family of The Gleneagle and Scotts Hotel. I am glad that we have Paudie O'Callaghan here of the Fáilte Hotel. Some people have passed on, including Maurice Galvin who travelled every inch of the country, particularly County Kerry, with Jackie. On the day my father was elected, Maurice said, ""I can die a happy man now."" I also refer to Pats Guerin, the BB Dens from Rathmore and the Bravos, Ned Carey and Johnny Mahoney. I will cherish the years I had with my father, including when we lived in the pub in Kilgarvan. He was very good to me and all of my family. He was very good to Eileen and all of my lads. He adored Johnny, Pat, Dan, Maura, Elaine and Theresa, for whom he did a great deal. He has rubbed off on all of them. He liked it when they called him ""Jackson"" which was their name for him.  My father was successful in everything he went at, whether it was tractors in the 1950s, hackney cars or heavy machinery. He was a successful publican, auctioneer and farmer. People may not be aware that he was able to weld, mow and plough better than anyone. Work never bothered him. He could milk the cows in the morning, travel to a meeting in Dungarvan, come home and milk the cows again in the evening, after which he would go to Rathmore or Gneeveguilla for political meetings. Work was no bother to him and there was never any notion of surrender.  My father had many interests. He was a magnificent hurler, something which has been well described in the House. What I remember about him on the field is that he was faster than anyone else. What he lacked in hurling ability, he made up for in speed.  My father loved all types of music. As chairman of Comhaltas in County Kerry, he brought six county fleadh cheoil events and one Munster fleadh cheoil event to Kilgarvan. He liked many singers and artists, including Charlie Pride, Johnny Carroll, Paddy Cole, Bing Crosby, Jim Reeves and, most especially, Dermot Flynn from Lisheenbawn and Killarney.  Jackie Healy-Rae never went on holidays, but on Saturday evenings he loved to go down the town in Killarney for an hour, as he would say, to meet as many people as he possibly could. However, it was as a politician that he excelled, something about which many Deputies have spoken today, for which I thank them. My father made an enduring name for himself across Ireland, County Kerry and many parts of the world. Imagine it is 22 years since he came here. He was so proud on that day and we were all so proud of him. He won two more elections in 2002 and 2007 and held his seat until 2011 when he was almost 80 years of age. As a family and an organisation, he gave us many opportunities to celebrate and be proud of who we were. He was co-opted onto Kerry County Council in December 1973 and headed the poll in 1974. He lit a fire in County Kerry at that time which is still burning brightly, propelling my brother, Michael, and I to win two Dáil seats in 2016 and Johnny, Maura and Jack to head the poll in three electoral areas in County Kerry on 24 May last. My father won a seat on Kerry County Council in 1979, 1985, 1991 and 1999, topping the poll on most occasions. He had massive political ability and a wonderful political brain. He was a master strategist and a charmer who was able to convince people. He had the power of persuasion. He was approachable to everyone and people confided in him. He was generous and wealth never concerned him beyond having enough to keep going. He loved people and always wanted to listen, while, of course, everyone wanted to listen to him. He has left a magnificent legacy of hard work for the people of County Kerry, for which each and every one of the people for whom he worked remembers him. It involved many small, personal and private matters right up to larger community projects. He was so proud of what he had achieved and deliverd in the Dáil, including Kenmare Hospital, the Castleisland bypass, roundabouts, Barraduff Bridge, the Kenmare relief road, SouthDoc and Killarney House which he ensured was included in the capital investment programme in late 2010. There are so many other things of which I cannot think or which I do not have the time to mention.I am proud to have this chance to be in Dáil Éireann. When my late father was first elected to this House 22 years ago, I never thought that it would happen. I am honoured to have this chance to pay tribute to Jackie Healy-Rae. We were side by side for all of his life. We will continue his work while the people of County Kerry want us and God above allows us to do it. I look forward to meeting him in another kingdom at a future time. He rang me every night and every day when he was not at home. I only wish when my phone rings now that it would show the number 087-2506633 because it often rang and meant so much to me. He did so much for me. I can honestly say he gave us the chance to start. It could be the case that if it was not for him, we would never have been here and would never have got as far as we did. It is up to us to work as hard as we can to continue his work because that is what he would want us to do. His voice would be music to my ears if I could hear it again."	spk_139
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-06-26	dail	32	Carers: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_34	I welcome the opportunity to speak to this important motion. People cannot organise the timing of when they get sick. It often happens that an elderly mother, father, brother or sister gets sick and has to go to hospital. Eventually they cannot stay in the hospital any longer and are faced with the choice of going into a home or going home. Many people from different walks of life do not like going into a home; it is a last resort. They feel that if they go into a home they will never come out into the world again. People want to go home and stay in their home for as long as possible. It is then up to a family member, perhaps a single daughter or son, to look after that person. They may be working and may have to give up their job and come home to mind their mother or father. The carer may be a mother who is already very busy with a young family and is going out to work. She is then asked to give up her job to mind her mum or dad. Those family members apply for carer's allowance. That is the first time for them to be without their wages and they find that it takes up to 16 weeks to get the carer's allowance. It is unbelievable that people have to wait that long. Why does it take so long? Why can we not have more people processing the claims? After weeks it is pointed out that something is missing from the application and it takes more time. That person is either trying to borrow money from the credit union or trying to live on something they can get from the elderly parent's pension. It is not fair and it is not good enough. Government Members continually talk up the economy, but I believe there is no copper at all because anytime we look for something, money seems to be the trouble. People would appreciate it if the truth is that the Government does not have the money. There is a lovely new hospital in Kenmare with only half of it open and at present there is only one respite bed there. If an elderly person gets two weeks' respite care in a year, for that entire area that hospital can cater for only 24 people. For the entire area from Poulgorm Bridge where one turns off the Cork road back to the end of Lauragh, through Kenmare and likewise down into Sneem as far as Castlecove or Caherdaniel and all the places in between it is not enough. I am asking for that hospital to be fully utilised and brought into service.	spk_347
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-06-25	dail	32	Summer Economic Statement 2019: Statements	dbsect_32	On health, I do not know how much money the Minister proposes to put into the HSE this year but it is not performing the way anyone wishes it would. I do not know if money is the answer because so many things have gone wrong. Respite care was mentioned. Telling elderly people that they must wait until the middle of November for home help is ridiculous and nonsensical. Carers are waiting a long time to get a payment. Some people for whom they are caring have actually died before the carers got paid for caring for them. On agriculture, farmers are wondering what is going on with this €100 million or is it €50 million? Must they reduce stock to qualify for this funding or is it intended for farmers who are genuinely suffering and have lost money? I must remind the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, that in 2013, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, told farmers to increase production. The current Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and Commissioner Phil Hogan are telling farmers that they must reduce production. I have to remind the Government that in the meantime, farmers have spent millions - money they had and money they did not have but borrowed. They are now being told that they must reduce production when they might have no way of paying back that money and that they should plant some of their land. For the Government to dictate to farmers in this way rather than working with them is very unfair. It is ridiculous to think that after a short space of years, the Government is now telling farmers that they must reduce production and not grow any more.  The threat of carbon tax is another issue. I would tell the Minister and Minister of State and even Fianna Fáil that all they are doing at the moment is trying to be greener than the Green Party. They will have to be practical and bring forward practical solutions. The Government is imposing deadlines on working-class and poor people and suggesting they must get out of their cars when they cannot manage without them in rural Ireland. There is no place to plug in and charge an electric car. It is like putting the cart before the horse because that is what the Government is doing. It is hurting the people and the people are scared. There will be a general election. The Government must realise this and it will get its answer on the doorstep when it goes to the people.	spk_280
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-06-19	dail	32	National Maternity Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_31	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important motion. It is grand to be talking about something as natural as this. When we were talking about babies last year, it was talk about killing people but this is better, proper and natural. The birth of a baby is a very important thing to a mother and a family. We need to ensure we have a safe, modern and world class service for mothers and babies.I commend the tremendous maternity services at Tralee General Hospital and I congratulate the doctors, nurses and midwives who provide those services. They are exceptionally good, as are maternity services at Cork University Hospital. For many people in County Kerry, Cork University Hospital is closer than hospitals in Kerry.  As stated by Deputy Michael Collins, it has to be recognised that many parts of Kerry are long distances from Tralee General Hospital. Cuhig in Lauragh on the boundary of Ardgroom in the Bearhaven, Valentia Island and pockets of Glenmore and the Black Valley are approximately an hour and a half away from the maternity hospital. It should be possible for a pregnant woman who requires emergency services to access them in Dingle Community Hospital, Kenmare Community Hospital or Killarney Community Hospital. There must be emergency services available in these hospitals to allow for the delivery of a baby sooner than the journey to Tralee General Hospital would allow for the baby to be born safely.  It is important that we have a world class maternity service. We are appealing to the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, and the Government to ensure maternity services throughout the country, including in Kerry and Cork, are modern and world class. Our babies are our future and it is vital they are born safe and well for the well-being of our communities.	spk_371

I thank Sinn Féin for bringing it forward. It has always been my understanding that if someone gives a tip, it is for the waiter or the workers and not for management. It is for the staff. I have had no complaints in my county that anything other than that happens, but I hear it happens in other parts of the country. I am disgusted about that. In my county of Kerry I have not heard a complaint about it from any staff, and I am around it as much as anyone. I am glad to support this Bill to ensure that the staff get the tips. If I give a tip to someone, I would mean it to be for the staff, the waiters and the workers in the kitchen or whoever. It is rarely I go out like that. That is what I always understood the tip was for. If I go back far enough, and I am going back a good bit now, when I was a young fellow cutting hay with a 135 and a finger-bar mower, if I got a tip of a half crown or ten shillings from a farmer, I would make sure I cut it as close it as I could to the ditch for him and that I would leave nothing standing. One man used to give an English pound note every so often and I never forgot him. Tips are definitely for the staff and not for the management. As Deputy Michael Collins said, there has been a drop in the tourism business because of the Government's drastic increase in the VAT rate, and I hope the Minister of State is listening to me. It has already hit County Kerry and there is a reduction in business. We can attribute it to nothing else but that. We had two great years in 2017 and 2018 but the signs are that it will not be as good this year. There is only one factor that is being directed at and it is the increase in the VAT rate. It was too severe and too much altogether, and the Government should have realised that. I am disappointed the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism, Deputy Griffin, who comes from our county allowed that happen in a county that depends so much on tourism. Let there be no ambivalence about it, however, that I am supporting the Bill in order that this issue is addressed throughout the country, although it does not appear to be an issue in County Kerry as I have heard no complaints, to ensure that workers get their tips, which is what the Bill is about.	spk_342
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-06-11	dail	32	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_4	Small farmers and businesses, especially shop owners, have been waiting for a revised fair deal scheme for many years. The Minister of State at the Department of Health has announced that he will shortly bring forward this Bill, which was promised several times before. I will highlight what is wrong with the proposals the Minister of State will bring forward. The Department is still insisting that 100% of the value of the farm must be assessed for the fair deal scheme, as well as the family home, which is wrong. If a farmer gets sick or hurt, which is a possibility because of the type of physical work involved, the young person taking over must have been farming for three years and must continue to farm for six years. What is going to happen when young children cannot take over the farm and a wife would have no other income if she did not rent the farm, for example? That is very wrong. Has the Minister of State any regard for small farmers and rural Ireland, where people are barely surviving? It is very wrong and after all the time we have waited, is this the best the Minister of State can do?	spk_148

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-06-11	dail	32	Northern Ireland: Statements	dbsect_30	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute on this important matter. We speak about the North of Ireland, going back to our ancestors and history, and it should be a full part of our country. One objective that I share with many others is that we would again be one country under one all-Ireland government. In the context of Brexit, there are many possibilities that could have adverse effects on our Twenty-six Counties, and it is in that light that so many people are so concerned right around the Republic of Ireland. For the past six months nobody can understand why cattle are €200 per head dearer in the North of Ireland than they are in the South. We appreciate when buyers come from the North of Ireland for our cattle because at least it gives us a vital export market. When we see what factories are doing to farmers, particularly beef farmers around the country, live exports become very important for the farmers in our neck of the woods. They greatly appreciate buyers, whether they are taking cattle up to the North or across to Great Britain. The great imponderable matter is what will happen if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. We can consider how unfair this would be, as the people in the North of Ireland voted overwhelmingly to stay in the European Union. Brexit would affect small employers and exporters, as well as those involved in manufacturing. I have been told by employers in Castleisland, Killarney and mid-Kerry that if there is a hard border with tariffs, there will be severe job losses in parts of Kerry as well as every other part of the country. We are very grateful for the cross-border directive initiative, which allows us to take patients who would not otherwise be seen here in the South of Ireland to the North. Patients in Cork and Tralee hospitals were put on waiting lists for a simple cataract procedure and have to wait four to six years to have this done, perhaps losing their sight in the meantime. I am glad that almost two years ago Deputy Michael Collins and I started using buses to bring people for treatment in the North of Ireland. We have brought so many people on those buses. A man who went on the first bus had been waiting for a cataract procedure for six years. In the early 1960s, his grandfather had that simple procedure done in Tralee general hospital. People would like to think Ireland has moved on and improved but we have gone backwards as we have to take people who are aged 90, 92 or 94 to the North for treatment. One man with failing sight went because the doctor would not sign the application to renew his driver's licence. He had his cataracts removed in Kingsbridge Private Hospital and got his licence a few days later. These are important issues for people and we are failing in that regard. It is great that we have the opportunity to restore people's eyesight rather than have them lose it. There is an 82-year-old man getting his hip done today. He would have otherwise had to wait in pain for years for the procedure but tomorrow he will go to a hospital in Kerry to recuperate. It is desperate but there is an opportunity to treat those people who would otherwise be in pain. It would be disastrous to lose that option and we hope the cross-border initiative, under which people can be reimbursed for the cost of the procedure, will continue. As we all know, the Health Service Executive has let us down badly and many people are saying it fails people in every regard. We can see the problems with waiting lists and people on trolleys. No matter how much money is being pumped into the executive, it is not having the desired effect. The cross-border initiative is the one good thing about it. Many of us desire for the Six Counties to be united with the Twenty-six Counties. We almost had that with the Good Friday Agreement. If anything should happen leading to a hard border between us and the people in the North of Ireland, it would be a pure disaster. I appeal to the Minister of State, as part of the Government, to ensure he does everything to prevent Brexit from happening. People right around the country are so fed up by what is going on and the indecisiveness of those people in England. They cannot make up their minds as to whether they are coming or going. If we were in their position, the whole world would laugh because of what is being done. Their actions are disastrous. They do not know what they want or how they will achieve it. They have said they are leaving and not leaving. They are seeking different conditions. There are people hopeful of becoming the next British Prime Minister and they are trying to sell the story that the European Union will give them new concessions or a better deal. They will not get it and the European Union will not change just because there is a new person in the British Prime Minister's seat.	spk_508

The Project Ireland 2040 plan and the millions or billions that will be spent in the meantime matter little to a particular lady who gets 20 minutes' home help and does not have anyone to cook her dinner. She is sick and tired of sandwiches and being showered. No one has time to cook a dinner for her. That is very unfair. Another lady, who is very elderly, has €57 left for her weekly outgoings after paying for private home help to supplement the small amount of home help she gets from the HSE. This plan matters little to such people who are being cut to the bone. On hospitals, Kenmare and Dingle hospitals are only half open. There are people on trolleys day after day and other people waiting in emergency departments. During questions on promised legislation, I raised the issue of the lousy deal that is supposed to be given to farmers under the fair deal scheme. People are waiting 12 or 14 weeks to be assessed for the fair deal scheme and their families are trying to pay for their stay in a nursing home because they cannot be left in community hospitals. The plan refers to climate change and all the money that will be spent on it. The current generation of farmers are doing so well for their environment and have complied with all the regulations with which they have been asked to comply. I thank the generations of farmers who got us here, the people who came before us and looked after our land and country. Like everyone else, I appreciate our environment - rivers, lakes and mountains - and so did those farmers. They got us to where we are. There is now a new wave of people who are saying, ""Save the planet and to hell with the people."" That is what is going on. The Government is planning to spend billions between now and 2040. Where will it get that money? It will get it from the farmers and off the backs of the poor people who are trying to go to work and have only a car to take them there. The Government is talking about imposing more carbon taxes. Carbon tax matters little to those who do not have housing."	spk_530

Even though inspectors have visited sites and decided that planning permission be granted in line with what Kerry County Council has ordained, An Bord Pleanála then refuses said permission.

I thank Fianna Fáil and Deputy O'Dea for giving us this opportunity. The housing adaptation grant is very important for people who need it. None of us knows the minute or the hour when someone belonging to us would become ill or disabled and it is very important that people can access the housing adaptation grant and get a little bit of help through this. However, there are difficulties. We do not have enough funding for bigger issues, such as somebody who wants an extension. I know of several cases and in one case the husband is in a wheelchair and the wife is very incapacitated. They have been waiting for a number of weeks for an occupational therapist. I honestly believe the Government is the best crowd in the world for the bush in the gap. There is a problem with people accessing what the Government tells them they are entitled to. If they were keeping a thieving heifer out of a field they would have no bother because it is now impossible to access some of the services people are told they are entitled to. This is no fault of Kerry County Council because it is one of its best sections and it does tremendous work in giving people what it can but its money is limited. When people ask for a bathroom, shower or stair lift it is turned around very quickly because it is small money but when it increases to €15,000 for €20,000 people are waiting for a year and a half. This is too long because a year and a half for an invalid or someone in trouble is too long. The answer we get from the local authority is that it does not have enough funding. Will the Government please address this issue? We need more funding for this grant. An issue giving people an awful lot of difficulty is that the age for eligibility for grant aid for the elderly has been increased to 66 years. Previously the local authority had discretion to turn it around and do something for someone aged 59 or 60 who had a leaking roof, whether there was a door or a window falling in. We say we want to keep people in their homes for as long as possible but over the past three or four years when people over the age of 60 look for some help they have severe difficulty because the council cannot or will not give it to them until they reach the age of 66 years.	spk_288
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-05-29	dail	32	Rural and Community Development: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_32	I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on this important matter this evening. There has been much talk about rural Ireland since I was first elected. At the same time, with my hand on my heart, matters are not improving for rural Ireland. In fact, it is worse they are getting. The most effective way to help rural Ireland is jobs. Sadly, very few jobs are being directed to Kerry through Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland. If established industries like Liebherr Cranes, Munster Joinery, Michael Cronin’s Readymix and Fexco in Killorglin were taken out of the heart of Kerry, one could put up a gate at the county bounds with a “Closed” sign on it. There is tourism in Kerry but that has been hurt badly by the Government with the increase of the VAT rate by 4.5% in one foul twist. Kerry has a Minister of State but this is what he allowed to happen. There are jobs coming into Dublin city, day in and day out. Only the other day, 660 jobs were announced for Dublin. However, the Government is not able to house them or police them. They are killing each other in ones, twos and threes in the city. There is no attempt to direct some of these jobs to Kerry or the west. There are places being starved and deprived of jobs. On top of that, the Government, along with Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin, were bound to the drink-driving laws of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. The social fabric of rural Ireland has been blown to smithereens. People are isolated in their homes now because they are not allowed to have a pint or two going home from work. They can hardly come out the following morning to go to mass. I have said here before that the Government has the churches closed, along with the Garda stations and many of the schools. Many people ask me why the Government fired my good friend and neighbour, Pat Spillane. He was doing great work on behalf of rural communities. The Government got rid of him because he was telling it what it did not want to hear. He did much good work but he is now left behind. Young people are disappearing from of south Kerry at an alarming rate.To take last year, one national school in Iveragh enrolled only two children. That is a fact. At an IFA meeting in Sneem three or four weeks ago, eight people were in attendance and all of them were septuagenarians aged over 73 years. That is what is happening. I highlighted the issue of home help yesterday and between interruptions and one thing and another, I do not know if I was heard properly. I will give the Minister of State an example of two elderly ladies who are trying to stay in their homes as long as possible. The home help of one of the elderly women has been cut to 20 minutes in the evening. When the home help arrives, the lady asks her if she could make a dinner for her but the home help tells her she cannot do that in 20 minutes but will make her a sandwich and shower her. The lady told me she is sick to the teeth of showers and she is hungry. She told me she asked the home help if her husband would live on sandwiches when he comes home from work every evening and if he would be happy if she told him she would give him a sandwich instead of dinner. That elderly lady is trying to stay living in a rural place. She cannot get the meals on wheels service because she lives too far from Killarney. She is not being provided for, which is a sad reflection of what is happening in rural Ireland. The other lady is well into her 80s but she is in good shape. Sadly, her family believe she would be better off in a home but she does not want to go into a home. Between paying for private home help and what she is getting from the HSE, she is left with only €57 a week on which to live. That is what the Minister of State and his Government is presiding over. I could take the Minister of State down to those two houses in Kerry to see what is happening. It is a shame and a disgrace that this is happening in Kerry. I am sad that I have to highlight an issue as personal as this one but what I have said is the God's gospel truth of what is happening in Kerry at the present time. There is much talk about schemes for towns and villages. I admire the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring. He is a good man but he goes on a bit. Some of the things he should be providing for are not being provided. He gave us funding for the local improvement schemes but I remind the Minister of State that we have 800 applications on hand. At the rate we are going, it will be 20 years before the last of those applications is seen to if more funding is not provided. Houses in towns and villages are falling down because many people have abandoned houses. Rathmore on the N72 is the first town one comes to on the road into Kerry. I am amazed at the number of unoccupied buildings in the town, many of which are not fit to live in. It would be helpful to have a scheme to help address the state of such buildings in towns like Cahirciveen or even Kilgarvan. There are many empty houses in Kilgarvan and it appears there is no future for them. In a very short space of time, the roofs of these houses will fall in. Caherciveen is a very a popular tourist spot on the Ring of Kerry but if something is not done sooner rather than later to address the state of some of the buildings in the town, many of the roofs will collapse and the town will look terrible. In spite of the great work done all over the county by Tidy Towns committees, which I praise on high for the great work they do, they will not be able to camouflage the damage that will be done to villages and towns in the next seven to ten years. The roofs of most of those unoccupied buildings will collapse if a scheme is not initiated to address them. The Minister of State is a member of the Government that is delegated with the power to address these matters. Many villages are practically closing down. In Lauragh, the post office and shop have closed, in Currow, the pub and shop have closed and in Gneeveguilla, the shop and post office have closed. Scartaglin has been waiting for the past 30 to 40 years for a treatment plant. Castleisland has been waiting for a sewerage extension scheme since 1986. Rathmore and Kilgarvan post offices have closed. I could go on and on. Another serious issue that I raised in recent days concerns people who wish to build their own homes. They will pay for that to be done and they apply for planning permission to Kerry County Council. However, we have one serial objector who appeals to An Bord Pleanála when Kerry County Council decides to grant planning permission. An Bord Pleanála then refuses planning and overrules decisions even when an inspector has called to the site and said the application should be granted. We do not know what is going on but this would not happen in any other country. These people would not get away with that in any other country and I am asking the Minister of State not to let them get away with it in this country or in County Kerry. Other factors are preventing locals from getting planning permission. The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, issued a direction to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in 2012 not to allow people to open an entrance to a new dwelling on a national secondary road or have access to a new dwelling from existing entrances. This rule applies on a road that is miles long and where it would safe to have such access. Kerry County Council granted planning but this rule that was signed into law by the then Minister deprived five families from getting planning permission. That is what is happening in rural Ireland. I could go on. The Government needs to wake up. There are things that can and should be done. I advise the Minister of State that the Government is letting the people down and that is the gospel truth.	spk_311
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-05-29	dail	32	Development of Primary Care: Statements	dbsect_34	"I am glad to get the opportunity to speak. We have a duty of care as elected representatives and must ensure all the people who present sick, ill or whatever get a fair and proper assessment and are dealt with in a professional way as soon as possible. The Government has published the national primary care plan. I do not give it much credence. I have listened to too many plans, reports and proposals that never seem to take off. My brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, rightfully, praised the ambulance crews. The ambulance crews themselves are fine and do their job as well and as efficiently as ever they can. In recent times, a 94 year old woman was waiting for two hours for an ambulance in east Kerry. That is a fact and it is not a joke. Likewise, another person in mid-Kerry waited for two hours for an ambulance. That was not happening in Kerry up until a certain thing was done by the HSE, which it called the ""reconfiguration"" of the ambulance service. That was the word it used. What it actually meant was a reduction in ambulance services. When the ambulance leaves Killarney with a patient for Cork University Hospital, CUH, when it drops off the patient, the ambulance is told to press a button in the ambulance as they are coming out of CUH saying they are available for work. Instead of going back to Killarney to deal with the Killarney people, that ambulance could finish down in Fermoy, Youghal, Mitchelstown, in any part of Cork or even could be sent to Limerick. That is what is happening. That leaves Kerry exposed until some other ambulance comes back to Kerry, which does not happen because the flow of ambulances is to the bigger hospital. We are left waiting for two hours. Then we have ambulances with personnel from Cork and other places struggling to find places in Kerry. When they were asked to go to Lispole they went to Listowel. Simple things like that. I imagine the Minister of State does not know the distance between Lispole and Listowel. Things like that are still happening. We are talking about patient care. None of us knows the hour when we will get sick. A man rang me yesterday evening about his wife. She is doubled over with pain. She got a letter saying she is on a waiting list to be called for an endoscopy assessment. We went after it and found that if the doctor would say it was serious and urgent, she would be called within eight days but if that did not happen, she would be waiting doubled over for practically three months. That is not good enough when someone is in pain. It is the same with people with pain in their hip or knees. If they are just on a medical card, they will have to wait and stay awake at night with pain. That is not good enough. That is the health service as it is operated at the minute.  I raised the issue of home help here today. The Government is all talk about keeping people in their own homes as long as possible. That is not happening because the home help hours are being cut. In one instance a woman asked the home help, who had just 20 minutes in the evening, if she could cook a dinner for her. The home help said, ""I cannot. I can give you a shower and I can give you a sandwich."" The woman said to me, ""Danny, to hell with the showers. I am showered to death. I am actually hungry."" That is God's gospel truth. I am not adding one iota to it. Cutting the home help time to 20 minutes is ridiculous.  I refer to people with disabilities. I am talking about children who are born to a mother and father who are going to have a disability, mental or physical, for all the days of their life. This is a terrible cross and a burden on families to which it happens, but that is nature, that is life, that is the cross they have been given. I feel for those parents when they get elderly. I know a family where the father is 75 years and the mother is 79. They are very worried about where their 57 year old disabled son is going to finish up. They are still taking him in the car to meet the bus to go to day centres. The biggest worry they have now is not the problem of seeing after him but what is going to happen to him when they are gone. That is their worry. That is replicated right around the county of Kerry which I represent. I know so many people in that position. The Government is failing in that regard. It is failing to do anything about it. The Minister of State should not shake his head because I know it is and know the people who are involved. The Government wanted to put some of these disabled people in decongregated settings to put them out into the communities. I told the Minister of State about some of these people before. They are not able for it and will never be. I know one child - I still call her a child but she is 46 years of age - who is blind and is balled up in a little ball. She does not know anything but they have her kept alive in St. Mary of the Angels and the Government wanted to take her out of it. That is very wrong. The Government has some people taken out of it and is paying €600,000 and €700,000 a year to keep them in a decongregated setting. That is where the Government is spending the money wrong.  People in pain are not being seen after and I just do not give credence to these primary care plans and all other plans. There are so many little things the Government could do to ensure that when people are in pain and need help, they should be seen to, no matter if they just have a medical card. The only way we can get some of those people seen to is to send them into the accident and emergency department and tell them not to come out until they are seen. Otherwise they would remain in pain for weeks or probably until they died.  My father fought hard to get a new community hospital for Kenmare. Only half of it is open still, 80 years on. There is only one respite bed and families trying to care for elderly people and doing their best to keep them in their homes for as long as possible. They need a break. The hospital in Kenmare services from Poulgorm Bridge all the way to Caherdaniel, practically as far as Waterford, and back the other end of the peninsula as far as Lauragh. To think that hospital can only cater for 26 patients in a year.That is what is going on. The lucky patients get two weeks. That is what we get when we divide 26 patients over 52 weeks. That is all that is being catered for, while there are still 18 or 20 beds to be opened in that hospital. There is talk about the difficulty of getting nurses. There would be no problem if they were paid properly. It is the same story in Dingle Community Hospital. There were between 22 and 24 patients on trolleys in University Hospital Kerry, Tralee, in the middle of the roasting summer. That is wrong. I do not think the Government understands this. We have five Ministers responsible for health in the Government and we still do not have a proper health service for people who are sick. I am sorry. I have nothing personal against the Minister of State but I have to point out what the people we represent are telling us."	spk_344

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-05-29	dail	32	Loss of Biodiversity and Extinction of Species: Statements	dbsect_35	I am glad to have the opportunity to talk about this issue. Anything renewable or environmentally friendly will always be good but it must be practical for the people affected. If not, the country will be designated with no place left for people. Farmers must be compensated for land that is designated as a wild habitat. Many farmers have no problem with that if they are properly compensated. However, it must be remembered that lands in the Ballydesmond, Castleisland and Rock Chapel areas were designated for the hen harrier but the farmers and landowners affected have not been properly compensated to date. I have told the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that there is no problem with the Department designating any lands for wildlife once the farmer or the landowner is properly compensated. A farm is a business and it is important ecologists understand this. Terms like “custodians and caretakers of the countryside” can seem patronising when someone is running a business, raising a family and paying bills. Instead, wildlife conservation on the land must make financial sense. Proper predator controls are not in place when dealing with grey crows, black crows, magpies, foxes, badgers, rats and hawks which will clean out ground-nesting birds. As a result, we have lost the curlew and the corncrake. In England they still have gamekeepers but in Ireland we do not have any. I have been told that if we had enough gamekeepers, the corncrake and the curlew would still be plentiful in this country. We know gamekeepers cost money. It is fine to have all these ideas. We all love the insects and the bees. I do as much as anybody else and no one can take that from me. However, one has to pay the landowners and farmers if their lands are going to be designated.	spk_382

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-05-28	dail	32	Vulture Funds: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_34	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important matter. I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for doing so much work in the background to get this Private Members' business up and running. I regret the sarcastic attack that the Minister made on us because we are raising this issue. He says that we do not have a monopoly, which we do not. We have an understanding and the Government does not. We are asking the Government to deal with the matter where vulture funds are profiting from vulnerable people. We know what is happening. It is a traumatic time for a family to lose their home and to have to leave. Other things could be done to prevent that. The Government is giving money to local authorities to buy houses and compete against first-time buyers on the open market instead of building houses. The Government could do different things. It could buy these houses, give the funds to the local authorities, and rent the houses back to the families. In time, maybe they could get on their feet again and go from renting to getting a loan and buying back the house. They would remain in their home. It would mean that small children could stay in their own little bedrooms and sitting rooms, and they could keep using the kitchen and the fridge that they were used to. Small businesses, farmers and people who survived the crash and who paid employees are still going to the wall because lenders will not even talk to the people who are in trouble. The next thing that happens is that the vultures sell off their properties and leave them behind. It cannot be right for the borrower to be overruled after going into a contract with a certain lender, bank or mortgage company. They overrule it and give the poor borrower no say about what it is doing. We know what vultures are on a farm. They are great crows that come and pick the eyes out of a lamb or a calf. I have seen it myself. They are left to die. I know what we are talking about when we talk about vulture funds. I appreciate people who employ others, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, because I employ people. I do not know if the Minister understands it, since I do not know what his background is, but I certainly know that Friday evening comes very quickly if one has 20, 40 or 60 men to pay. If a payment does not come in, things can start to go wrong very quickly. Even after all the years of building up something, one can start to get into trouble. People need a bit of time. As Deputy Brassil said, these institutions will not even answer calls and talk to people, which is wrong. I read a sign in front of a pub in Killarney stating that a bank is an institution that will lend money if a person does not need it or has money. We saw that when farmers were supposed to get cheap loans. The Government made a big announcement about farmers getting loans to deal with the fodder shortage. I know what happened. If someone was a short way into the red, that person got no loan. Only the fellows who did not need them got the loans. That is wrong but it is the truth. I am hurt by the sarcastic way in which the Minister attacked us for tabling this motion. We may not have a monopoly and I agree with him on that, but we have an understanding and know that people are hurt. This is wrong. The Minister and the Government have the power to stop this.	spk_318

Deputy Mattie McGrath seems to be sure that the end game is in sight with Brexit. I am not so sure that it is. Kerry is the county furthest away from Europe and the next stop is New York. The people I represent are tired and fed up with all this talk of Brexit. It is Brexit for breakfast, dinner and supper and if people have anything after that it is once again Brexit before they go to bed. A great deal of uncertainty has come about on foot of Brexit. No more than I or anyone else, the Minister of State does not know what is in the mind of the British Government or what the latter will eventually end up doing. This uncertainty is having an adverse effect on employers, particularly small employers. Friday evening comes around very quickly for an employer and that is when wages must be ready to be paid to workers in order to keep families going. I know that from my experience as an employer. Money must be ready and there must be a plan to keep employees on board because it is difficult to get good people. We appreciate the employees we have and we want to be able to retain them. It is the same for all employers. The situation with Brexit has given rise to uncertainty and is adversely affecting many sectors. There is a fear in the tourism sector that the revenue from many English tourists will be lost to the economy if the UK leaves the European Union. Small employers exporting abroad are not employing any extra people and are unsure if they will be able to keep their current workforce.  Regarding the farming community, and this is very important, we are very grateful we have an extra window of opportunity. I do not think, however, that the Government, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or Bord Bia are doing enough to source extra markets for farmers and their produce, whether live exports or processed beef. Much more should be done. This extra time should be used wisely to ensure that farmers are not left stranded because they are already feeling the effects of Brexit. The price of cattle has decreased and costs are not being covered. No suckler or beef farmer is covering his or her costs now and that is the honest, gospel truth. Sourcing more markets would have a dual purpose - it would provide competition for the meat factories as well alternatives if the UK market is lost to us. The price paid for Irish beef in the UK is already lower than the price paid for beef from UK farmers and other countries. That is not fair and not right and there should be an investigation. I asked for this before, I am asking for it now and I will be asking for it again if it does not happen. There is a better price in the North for the same weight of cattle than there is in the South. Why is that the case? That should not be. I am raising this issue again on behalf of the people I represent. In the same vein, small fishermen are very concerned about how they will be affected if a deal is concluded and the UK leaves the EU. These are just some of the issues we face. I refer again to tourism and the English market. It has been much appreciated by our small hotels, bed and breakfast establishments and all of the facilities we have, especially around the Ring of Kerry and in Killarney. Bord Fáilte needs to source other markets if the English market needs to be replaced.	spk_323
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-04-17	dail	32	Public Transport: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_32	"I cannot support the motion. While I have the height of regard and respect for Deputies Eamon Ryan and Catherine Martin of the Green Party, I do not agree with the motion they have put forward. It focuses on Dublin and touches on Galway, Cork and Limerick but there is a lot of territory beyond Limerick and Cork where people need their cars for transport. I agree with having more public transport but it cannot be at the expense of road projects for which we have waited half a century at least in some places. There are bridges and sections of road on the Ring of Kerry on which buses travel perilously every day. We need those buses to take our tourists around the Ring of Kerry, which is one of the products of which we are proud and which brings people to the county. It is one of the things that keeps the county going. The Green Party is saying ""Save the planet and to hell with the people."" It says we should get rid of the cars and let people walk, cycle or manage however they can. They say we should not be let cut the hedges either and that we should close the roads, never mind improve them. We are not to be allowed to cut the hedges or to travel safely. We know what we went through at the heritage committee to get an extension for the month of August for hedge cutting. The Green Party says children should not be transported to school. There are long journeys it is not possible for children to take safely on foot to get to school. They have to be driven there. In 2007, we were advised to change to diesel cars and it has been proved that these cars cause no harm to the environment in rural areas. There has been a great deal of talk about battery-powered electric vehicles. Where are the charging points? There is no place to get rid of the batteries after six or seven years. They cost more to dispose of than to replace, which is €6,000 or €7,000. Even if Ireland were completely emissions free, it would mean only 1.13% of 1% of total global emissions. It is also suggested that we should charge people more carbon tax. I am sorry the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has left because I wanted to remind him about Rural Link. He introduced the legislation which the Minister of State opposite, Deputy John Paul Phelan, supported and which Deputy Brassil supported by abstaining from the vote on it. Deputy Brassil attempted to confront the Minister by saying he brought those measures in ""controversially"" but although I begged the Deputy and everyone else not to support the Minister's Bill, they did. We were promised Rural Link when the Act was passed but where is it when it comes to Cloghera More and the Black Valley and one has to come out via Cloghernoosh and Cockow? Where is the transport that was promised? There is no account of it. It was only a case of ""live horse until you get grass"". There is talk of more public transport but we are talking about the road from Blackwater Bridge to Sneem where it is not safe for a car to meet a lorry or a bus. There will be a serious accident there. The motion proposes more public transport for Dublin and Galway, while letting the people in Kerry go to hell. That is not good enough for me and I will not subscribe to it."	spk_382

I would like to mention something that is a bugbear of mine. I suppose it does not relate to the actual motion. Maybe it relates slightly to it. We hear a lot of talk about a third terminal at Dublin Airport. At the same time, Shannon Airport has been downgraded. There is less activity at Shannon Airport than there was in years gone by. I wonder whether it is in the Minister of State's remit to try to help that situation. The people of County Kerry who use Shannon Airport frequently would like to see an enhancement of the airport rather than another terminal in Dublin, where there is so much resistance to noise. I believe motions dealing with that aspect of the matter are being advanced currently. We have never heard of any uproar or concern with regard to noise anywhere around Ennis or Shannon. Maybe the Minister of State will try to take some more of the business down to Shannon Airport, rather than putting all the pressure on Dublin Airport.	spk_446

It is such an issue with everyone. People, young and old are angry about the costs of insurance for everything. We know the hoops that younger people, for example, must go through when trying to get a car on the road for the first time. With the costs of insurance for such drivers, they try to buy the cheapest car possible. They then find the insurance companies will not take a car that is more than ten years old even though it may have passed its NCT. This anomaly seriously needs to be addressed. If the car has passed the NCT then it should be as good as the new car that comes out of the factory in every way, or that is what we are told. Many a family in rural places also needs a second car for taking the children to school and to all of those vital swimming and dancing lessons and so on. The haulage industry is going through a terrible time currently with the cost of fuel and insurance. Likewise, taxi drivers have to pay premiums in the region of €17,000 and €18,000 to get their taxis insured. This is their livelihood. The insurance is costing nearly €300 or €400 per week.  Small hotels, bars and restaurants find it impossible to get insurance now. Sports clubs and show committees are also affected. Places such as Kilgarvan, Glencar and Dingle, for example, run one-day events to retain their identity. With the post offices, creameries and shops gone, it is very important to let communities have at least one day so they can call themselves Kilgarvan people, Dingle people or Glencar people. There is the committee that organises the St. Patrick's day event in Sneem, for example. The world fiddle day in Scartaglin, the Sliabh Luachra music trail, the Castleisland fair day and the Patrick O'Keeffe music festival are all very important and vital to rural communities in the area. The events are suffering and paying through the nose for insurance. Some of them are falling by the wayside because they cannot pay for the insurance.	spk_477

I do not think the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, is listening to any of us this evening. We have enough plans, reports and reviews. What we want is money and action. If the money is not available, then the Minister should spell it out and tell us that is the case. There are a number of simple things that need to be addressed. Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned that the income threshold for people on the housing list needs to be raised as a matter of urgency. A couple with two children can earn up to only €33,000, and if they go over that, they are taken off the housing list. I am aware of one couple, among others, who are on the housing list for 11 years and they are afraid they will be thrown off it due to that ridiculous situation. The cap on the housing assistance payment, HAP, is too low for places such as Killarney and the busier towns such as Kenmare and Dingle. Currently it is €550 and it is €650 if a person gets the increased 20%. That is not adequate and the matter must be addressed. I am bawling here since I was elected asking the Minister to bring forward a tenant purchase scheme in such a way that retired individuals or couples would be allowed to purchase their homes. We had no tenant purchase scheme for five or six years and then it was opened up. People who have savings and the wherewithal to purchase their homes are not allowed to do so. No funding is available in County Kerry for demountable or modular homes. They were part of the housing set-up, for example, in a case where a farmer whose house got into a bad state of repair but who wanted to stay on his land brought in a demountable home, but that is not allowed. The stock we have is not being repaired and the living conditions are not adequate for those living in them. No funding is available for them. I do not know what the Minister of State is looking at but I know he is not listening to me.	spk_361

Everyone will agree this is the most cost-effective way to care for the elderly. The Kerry and Cork budget for this vital service has been cut by €3 million, however. Some genius of an official did not include travel in the costing. The home help staff do not have wings and cannot fly from house to house. I ask the Taoiseach to examine the budget. The Government is saying the Exchequer returns are strong. On top of that, there is an issue with the fair deal scheme. No money was provided last week to Kerry and Cork for the scheme.

The issue of the waiting time for children to be assessed is one of the biggest problems that I find in the county that I am elected to represent. Another is the lack of respite care for families. Funding for home support respite is needed. I see that at the coalface, the same as every other Member and every councillor around the country. Elected representatives are dealing with families who are struggling trying to get access to the vital services they need, whether it is getting the assessment in time or the funding for the supports. That is what we are trying to highlight here this evening. Autism-specific adult services are not available at present. Extra resource hours are needed for schools. I thank from the bottom of my heart the teachers and SNAs for the work they do throughout the country. They are a valuable treasure, as the Ceann Comhairle will be aware in his own constituency. These people - I am not being patronising in saying this - are saints because of the effort that they put into their role and the work and nurturing that they give, in particular, to young people who are starting out in life and to whom we want to give the very best. Just because a person might have a diagnosis of autism does not mean to say that his or her life has to stop. It means that we have to give the person with autism the resources that he or she requires to get the most out of himself or herself. Finally, there is a lack of funding for Autism Assistance Dogs Ireland. I acknowledge how valuable it is when a child receives such a dog because assistance dogs, as the organisation itself states, are changing ""the world for children with autism"". That means so much because that is exactly what they are doing. They are like a lifeline. It is like giving them a little person to be with and to grow up with and it is so nice to see it when it is working well. I acknowledge that great group. They should get more funding for the great work that they are doing."	spk_256

We have all mentioned agriculture several times. Then there are small businesses and hauliers. Fishermen are also going to be affected. I am very disappointed that the Government, supported by Fianna Fáil, is rushing the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill through the Parliament in the coming days to the detriment and loss of the inshore fishermen of Ireland. There are 14 coastal counties and I represent one of them, which is Kerry. I am very disappointed that this Bill is being rushed through to satisfy the Northern Ireland fishermen and the British Parliament, just to please them, even though England has said that if she leaves the European Union, she will be taking back her fishing waters. What is the hurry to rush this Bill through the Dáil tomorrow? What is the hurry until we see what Brexit throws up? We all hope that England stays but with this day-to-day way they are running, we do not know whether they are coming or going. It is time for them now to make up their minds. If they are going to postpone or delay Article 50, it should be postponed for two years to give them plenty of time to make up their minds. We need to be allowed to continue our work and ensure that our people can survive in the meantime and that their job opportunities remain. The Government is saying now that it met the organisation for the big trawlers that fish outside the six-mile limit.My phone in the office downstairs is hot, with inshore fishermen ringing from all around my county and others to ask us not to support the Bill tomorrow. It is premature until the United Kingdom decides what it is doing and we see what it will do within its waters. Why are we trying to satisfy the British and letting them fish up to our door on the mainland? In doing so we will clean out whatever fish small fishermen along the coast can catch. From Kenmare Bay, along by Blackwater, Tahila, the Oysterbed and Sneem pier and all the way to Reenard, small fishermen continue to try to put food on the table for their families. Are we going to blow them out of existence? Is that what Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are going to do to small fishermen to satisfy Northern Irish fishermen, even though we do not know what we will have after they leave the European Union? This is totally unfair. The United Kingdom has stated it will take back all of its waters. The Government is to introduce a Bill next year to require 50 ft. boats to stay outside the six-mile limit. However, it will be easy to get around it by making a boat 48 ft. or 49 ft. long which will be able to operate inside the six-mile limit. What is the reason for the hurry with the Bill the Government is rushing through? It has not been in such a hurry to deal with other things that are vital to people in dire straits. What is the hurry to deal with the Bill to be taken tomorrow? I ask the Government to postpone it. The inshore fishermen have copped on and know what the Government it is at. It is only a ruse to please some Minister in the UK Parliament at the expense of small fishermen in Kenmare Bay and Dingle and all the way along west Cork who are barely eking out a living from our waters. It is totally wrong. I do not blame the Minister of State personally, but I do blame her as part of the Government. I also blame Fianna Fáil for backing the Bill. I cannot understand what it is at.	spk_392

I welcome all those in the Visitors Gallery. It shows the concern people around the country have. There is the same concern in County Kerry where there have been savage attendances at Beef Plan meetings. We thank the people involved for organising and attending the meetings. They are putting their shoulder to the wheel and saying enough is enough and that they are not going to take any more. The Minister is not doing enough for live exports or to provide adequate lairage facilities in Cherbourg for calf exporters. He is not doing enough for the suckler cow men. There was a farmers' meeting in Sneem the other night and everyone in attendance was over 75 years. That is what is happening. Young people are falling away from farms and that trend is going to continue. I appeal to the Minister and the Government. Deputy Creed is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The Government will be remembered for what it does and what it will not do. This is its time. Farmers are on their knees and their heads are down. It is up to the Minister and the Government to do something to create more live exports. The rules the factories are using are keeping down prices for farmers. They include the four movements rule, the 24-month rule, the 30-month rule and the 70-day retention period. It is the Minister who must talk to the factories and bring them to task and ensure they are not using their monopoly against the farmers. He must take off his coat and go out. Charles Haughey went to Libya and into a tent with Colonel Gaddafi. Surely the Minister is as good and can do something like that and make a name for himself. This is the time to do it because farmers are on the ground. In the last couple of weeks there has been a small market for bulls in Turkey and already it is making a difference in places such as Castleisland in County Kerry.	spk_464

Every one of us is affected by the cost of insurance. Public liability and employers liability insurance are very difficult to obtain because of the rising costs. No thanks to the Minister, Deputy Ross, or to everyone in the Government and many in the House for supporting him, pubs are closing as it is and are finding it hard enough to stay open. On top of this, the cost of insurance is increasing. Between rates, levies and the rising cost of insurance, restaurants, clubs, guesthouses and bed and breakfasts are being hit. They employ people, they pay for us in here and they pay for the services of the country, including medical cards and all the grants. They are paying for the whole lot and they are being hit with the rising costs of insurance. The Ministers and the Government have been at it for the past three years and nothing has improved. It is actually getting worse. The days are running out and the Government's time is running out and if it does not do something in the time it has left it will be remembered forever for doing nothing about the rising cost of insurance. Many communities and small parishes throughout the country run a fair day, a carnival or a music event to retain their identity. For example, Scartaglin has a world fiddle day. The one day in the year for which all these show committees and agricultural committees work is being hit with the crippling costs of insurance but nothing is being done for them. With regard to playgrounds for children and vintage rallies, voluntary organisations are finding it very difficult to keep going. Civil contractors, agricultural contractors, plant hire companies and other companies are also finding it so difficult to keep going with the rising and crippling costs of insurance. Garages are being hit.Marts are being hit and are finding it very difficult to remain open. One of the biggest marts in the country has closed. The claim culture is responsible for much of the problem. How is an injury to a person's neck in Ireland so different to an injury to a person's neck in England? The most one will receive as compensation for a whiplash injury in the UK is £7,600. In Ireland, a person may receive anything from €19,000 to €77,000 for a similar injury. What is wrong there? Why is that not being examined? Why is the Government not discussing the matter with the Judiciary? Where is the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan? What is he doing about this? Why is he not talking to the Judiciary? What is being done? Nothing has been done thus far. A person was awarded €77,000 compensation for having a finger caught in a door, with legal costs accounting for 47%. Solicitors are advertising for claims. They tell people to claim and that they will not be charged if the case is not successful - no foal, no fee. That practice is wrong. It should be stopped because it is the height of blackguarding. There is so much wrong. The young drivers in rural Ireland who are very important to us and need their cars to go to college, work, apprenticeships and so on have also been affected. Now that they are not allowed to drive without passing their test or being accompanied by a qualified driver, their insurance should decrease, but it is increasing. They are being quoted figures such as €3,500, €4,500 or even €5,000 for insurance to get on the road. What does the Government have against our young people? Why is it trying to keep them off the road? It is bad enough that they must wait six, seven or eight months for a driving test. Why is the Government trying so hard to keep them off the road? Taxi drivers are paying anything from €13,000 to €17,000 or €18,000 for insurance. Driving is their livelihood. They need to stay on the road to earn a living. Hauliers are being hit with increases in public liability and employer liability insurance as well as vehicle insurance. They are receiving savagely high quotes and are under serious pressure to stay in business. The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is representing the Government on this motion. It is up to the Government to do something. It is no good for him to tell the House that the Government cannot interfere with the Central Bank. If it cannot, who can? If the Minister of State and the Taoiseach cannot do something about this issue, they might as well own up to that and admit that is time for them to get out of here. A salutary lesson can be learned from the Government's handling of the issue of the cost of insurance.	spk_313

As we all know, for as long as we can remember, sadly, people have gone missing and at a certain stage can be deemed definitely dead or presumed dead. I refer especially to those girls in the midlands and indeed the young child in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's county, Mary Boyle. We all remember them and the people left behind. Their loved ones suffer while they live with the suddenness of these people going missing and never returning home. Then there are people who go missing for various reasons and disappear practically off the face of the earth, and the figures in this regard have been given. Their families are hurt and have been left behind, suffering anguish and pain daily. We cannot imagine what these people go through. When a partner in a marriage or a civil partnership goes missing, the person left behind needs at some stage to be allowed carry on his or her life and live it in some normal fashion. I hope the Bill will give these people some rights and provide some light in terms of the way they will be allowed to go forward. I refer to property rights, the determining of ownership of homes and land and dealing with mortgages, bank accounts and all the daily, mundane things families must go through, whether it be a man or a woman left behind. If they have children, these children must be looked after, given the same chances as every other child, get schooling and go to college or whatever. If the deceased had land, the children should have the chance at a later stage to operate it, put it in their names and work it like every other person of their age and in the same position. It is very important we get this right. Examples have been given. If an Irish person, let it be a man or a woman, perhaps goes missing abroad for a year and may have left for very good reasons, we cannot have the scenario that that person would come back to deal with their ownership of and rights in respect of whatever property, whether a house, a farm or land, and perhaps find some other head in the bed, whether a man or a woman, instead of the person they left. We could not have that after a short period such as a year or so because people leave their homes and the places where they live and have been working for many reasons we may not understand. However, the Law Reform Commission's draft civil law (missing persons) Bill 2013, states that ""the fact that for a period of 7 years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant and the applicant has no reason to believe that the other party has been living within that time shall be evidence that the other party is dead until the contrary is proved"".What is important for us, as Members, is that we get the balance right in cases where a person does not seem to be returning. As Deputy Michael Collins said, we have to differentiate between cases. For instance, there are cases where fishermen are lost at sea and their bodies are never found. There is no question whatsoever of that person not being dead. In those cases, people need to be allowed to carry on with their lives and should not have to wait a long time to get a death certificate. They should be allowed deal with issues of property rights and benefits they may hope to receive from State. Such a situation has to be treated differently from a person who may disappear in another fashion. I refer to a case where a person goes missing for a number of years and there is no sign that he or she will be returning. There are no sightings of that person in the jurisdiction or, indeed, beyond it. I am glad to support this Bill. However, we have to be careful to strike the right balance. We must ensure what is intended does not hurt people who may actually not be dead."	spk_253

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-03-12	dail	32	National Children's Hospital: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_37	I believe this is the biggest single scandal that ever happened in this country. In March 2017, our group told the Government that this was going to happen. Many of the members of parties, who are jumping up and down now, voted against our motion when we asked that the hospital be moved to some greenfield site. They voted against our motion and now they are jumping up and down as to what happened and why has the cost escalated to such proportions. We clearly identified what was wrong at that time. We clearly asked as well that this children's hospital should be for children from all parts of the country. I spoke to a Deputy from Dublin here the other day and he said that he thought the reason they went for it and why in their opinion it was the right site to use was because the Luas was servicing it. We do not have a Luas out west in Kerry or along the western coast, and we do not have many other modes of transport that the people in Dublin have. Certainly, what we would need, when there is a crisis and when a child needs to be brought up, is to use the largest helicopter which can fight the winds and land at the hospital door but we are told now that this type of helicopter cannot land at this site. We have the debacle whereby many projects will be delayed, held up and put back. Many years ago, I had a request at the HSE south forum that there would be a community hospital in Killarney. It was progressing away well but now we know it will be deferred. The population of Killarney quadruples in summertime and we need a new community hospital to enhance the services that we could give there. I am not aiming at the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, but am directing my venom at those who are not here who should be here and that is a scandal as well. They should be sitting here. Certainly, if we were talking about abortion, the Minister, Deputy Harris, would be there. There would be no doubt about it. I suppose that is what happened. The Minister took his eye off the ball because all last year his only concern was abortion and he forgot about the children's hospital. He only left it plough on whatever way it would happen. In Tralee, we are waiting for extra beds that have been promised but they are not materialising. There are many patients on trolleys in pain, waiting for proper attention. After all their life given to working for this country, it is wrong that so many of them finish up dying on a trolley because we cannot put them into a proper hospital bed in Tralee general hospital. We have people who need eye treatment and could not manage, except for the number of buses as these days, we again have three buses going up to the North of Ireland. There were three in February, three in January and there will be two more in April so far. The story goes on. We cannot deal with those patients in our own country. We will see Dingle hospital half opened. As for all the other projects, I mentioned today the Kilcummin sewerage scheme that has been promised to the people for the past 15 years. That has been put back and that is because of this issue. We have the site, with props holding up the sidewalls in the hope they will keep the houses from falling in. That is not right. What we asked for and what we wanted is a greenfield site which would be accessible for all the children of the country. I am taking someone else's time. I could go on here for a long time.	spk_298
Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-03-06	dail	32	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_19	I wish to raise the plight of beef and suckler farmers countrywide. This vital industry is at a critical crossroads because farmers are not covering their costs. This cannot continue. There are two contributing factors. First, factories have a monopoly and are not paying farmers properly or fairly for the high standard of animals being produced and, second, not enough live exports are being sourced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or An Bord Bia, which would create competition for the factories and assist farmers in getting fair prices. Farmers throughout the country, including in Kerry, are attending beef plan meetings where they are expressing outrage at the inaction of this Government. They feel they are being neglected. Last week in this Chamber I highlighted the case of a Libyan buyer who was waiting more than three months for a visa so that he could come here to purchase more than 4,000 bulls worth €5 million. I welcome that, following my intervention, he received his visa, but it is too late because he has gone to Spain to do his business there. I hope he will return to Ireland another time. The factories are applying ridiculous rules and regulations to trip up farmers. In the case of the four movement rule, if it is shown that an animal has moved more than four times, the factory will reduce the price by €40 to €80, even though the quality of the beef is the same.They will still kill it and sell it, and it is the same steak on the plate for the consumer. On the 30-month rule, there is no difference whatsoever between an animal at 29 months or 31 months. If it goes over the age of 30 months, the price of the animal is again reduced by between €40 and €80. If the animal goes over the age of 36 months, the price of the animal is reduced by €200, while the price of bulls that go over the age of 34 months is cut by €350. The factories have databases. They know when every animal was born, and when it reaches the age of 24 months, they will hold it up for a few weeks before selling it at the lower price. The 70-day retention also hurts the trade. We do not have enough lairages in Cherbourg to take the dairy-bred calves out of the country. How is it that animals sell for €200 a head more in the North of Ireland? There is only a boggy ditch between us in places in the North and South of Ireland. The fifth quarter is the most serious aspect of what the factories are doing to farmers. It is worth more than €270 to the factory but farmers do not get one red cent of it. The factories sell offal, tendons, tongues, hides, hooves and all those parts of the animals but they do not give one cent to the farmer. It is stealing and robbery from farmers who work from dark to dark to put good animals into the factories.	spk_229

I have asked him many times in the Chamber but it looks as though he just does not get it or understand what is happening. The farming community is at a crossroads, as are all those who supply them or depend on them because when farmers go bad, the rest of the country goes bad. It is time for the farming community to come to the gate of Leinster House and tell the Taoiseach what is going on because he does not get it. We could speak in the Chamber day after day, night after night but still the Taoiseach will not listen. The farmers are on their knees and will not take it for much longer. I call on them, the Irish Farmers Association, the Beef Plan Movement and all the other farming organisations to come to Kildare Street and let the Government know once and for all what it is not doing for farmers. They are on their knees and cannot take it for much longer. The whole industry will close. The Taoiseach referred to Brexit but there are so many ifs and buts. While we would dearly love the United Kingdom to stay in the Common Market, it is both coming and going and it is either this or that. It should make up its mind to come or go. Nevertheless, the farmers will still be here and the Taoiseach is doing nothing about the factories for them. He could, but he will not because he is tied to them.	spk_231

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-02-26	dail	32	Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019: Second Stage	dbsect_17	I am glad to get an opportunity to talk about this important Bill. Among every section of every community in Ireland, nothing gives rise to concern as much as Brexit, which now has been talked about for almost two years. The various groups affected are so concerned. These include farmers, the self-employed and small companies exporting to the North and to Britain. The one issue that does not seem to be mentioned in the Bill, which has been highlighted by other speakers, is the hard border and how it will be managed. I agree with others that if Britain wants to leave the EU and maintain a border between the North and the South, that is a matter for Prime Minister May and the European Union to sort out. We cannot interfere or be a part of anything that would break up the Good Friday Agreement, into which so much effort was put by past leaders, Ministers for Foreign Affairs and everyone who was involved from all sides. Sinn Féin, the unionists, including the DUP and, in our country, former taoisigh, Albert Reynolds, Garret FitzGerald and Bertie Ahern, played their parts. All the leaders along the way put in hard work and we cannot ever again allow the divisiveness that obtained in our country for almost 30 years. We do not want that back and we cannot wish that upon our people, south or north of the border. We condemn and abhor much of what happened for that time, the wrongs that were done, and we do not want to go back to that. There are small things which can be very big things. I am being asked questions about driving licences and that issue needs to be explained. Will an Irish licence be recognised in Northern Ireland or Great Britain? What about lorry drivers? It will be the same for people coming to this country with an English driving licence. Will it work  I am glad that this week, at last, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, has indicated that, with conditions, he would be in favour of having a second referendum. We spoke about it in this House when news of the referendum result broke and I believe I was the first person to ask the then Taoiseach Enda Kenny to ask the UK Government to have another referendum. I hope that will happen. Many people, all along, have been asking and hoping that would happen. The people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland should be well informed before they cast their votes a second time. It is clear that they were not advised of all the pros and cons when they went to the polls the first time and of the adverse effects it could have for their country and other countries, especially ours. The backstop is important. I hope, if the UK decides to leave on 29 March, that the backstop is part of whatever deal will be agreed by the UK Government and Parliament. Maybe they will delay the UK's exit further and eventually save the day with another referendum. It has been mentioned that Irish farmers will get a package from Europe. Farmers are in a critical state now, especially beef farmers. Prices are very bad. Farmers have sheds of cattle and they are afraid of what will become of them. They are feeding and caring for them like they always have. The farming community comprises a wonderful set of people, especially the farmers I represent in Kerry. They are very concerned at the moment. There have been beef plan meetings in Castleisland, Kenmare, Dingle and Listowel. There are more planned in Dingle and Cahirciveen and there will be one in Listowel next Monday, 4 March. The price of cattle is the issue that is exercising their minds and they are concerned. I was at one of those meetings last night. We were told about what happened to a Libyan cattle buyer who wanted to buy 4,000 bulls in this country. I do not know if the Tánaiste is aware that there is a complete slowdown in taking bull beef from the farmers. To get a call from a factory that will take a few cattle from a farmer is like winning something big in the lotto. Farmers need contacts and the way the factories are operating at the moment is not fair. A few years ago, farmers were advised to go into bull beef, to deviate away from bullocks, but now nobody wants to take the bull beef. There has been a complete slowdown. A Libyan purchaser wanted to come here to buy 4,000 cattle worth €5 million. The Tánaiste is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. This Libyan man applied for a visa in mid-November to be allowed to come to see the cattle. The boat and buyers were organised but he wanted to come and see what he was getting. Lo and behold, he still has not been told what is wrong or if he will get a visa. I am afraid that the cows carrying calves at the time he applied will calve again before he gets an answer to his visa request. It is ridiculous that this has happened. We have been asking the Government day after day on the Order of Business to ensure that our country will have other live export options around the world. This has happened to our farmers under our noses who work so hard, from dark to dark, to try and produce top quality beef and there is then no outlet for them to sell it. It is ridiculous.  This Libyan man has now indicated that he is not interested in Ireland and he has gone to Spain. It is appalling that we have lost that volume of bull beef exports. It seems that he applied to the Department of Justice and Equality for a visa. No one has come back to him.Neither has anyone said they are looking for anything. The galling point about it is that the man was in this country several times before. There could not be much wrong but it is like somebody was not paying attention. It looked as if other Deputies made representations to the Minister for Justice and Equality on his behalf. However, sadly, nothing has happened and this is where we currently stand. We know there is a large beef market in Iran but it seems this has not been explored by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Farmers at these beef plan group meetings have asked about these markets. The group which has set up the beef plan has said it is trying to secure markets abroad. It is, however, up to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to do so. While he may have been castigated for different reasons, we remember when the former Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, went out to meet the then Libyan leader, Gaddafi, and secured markets when agriculture was on its knees before. The Government should not be beyond that. Ministers should be able to do that as well. There are now more ways to travel to new markets, as well as dealing with matters through email. I cannot understand how we have lost an export market like the one in question. It is a fact the majority of our beef exports go to the UK. The UK has already put pressure on us by suggesting it will allow in beef imports from South America. Likewise, Italy and Germany are exploring how to allow South American beef imports into their countries in return for allowing them to sell cars to South American countries. These matters are concerning for our farmers. We do not have enough lairage in Cherbourg. It is not France's responsibility to provide lairage for dairy-bred calves but that of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Bia for export on to markets like Holland. We cannot get them there because we need extra lairage in Cherbourg. Will the Minister team up with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Justice and Equality, to ensure these export markets continue to protect our agricultural industry? What travel arrangements are being made if Britain leaves? Will Britain still be the main landbridge between Ireland and the Continent? What problems will arise with the transport of animals? Can we avoid going through the UK as much as possible because there will be tariffs? People are asking these questions. I am appealing to the Minister to ensure the proper arrangements are in place to deal with these matters. Time is getting scarce. Fishermen are also concerned. They find it hard enough to survive with the elements and bad weather. Will the Minister explain how much of a package we will get from Europe to assist our farmers and fishermen? The cross-border health directive has been vital for many people in Kerry and west Cork. Through it, Deputy Michael Collins and I have taken 25 buses of people to the North of Ireland to get operations to remove cataracts, get hip or knee replacements, as well as for children to have their tonsils removed. Are we sure this will continue if Britain leaves the European Union? We have great admiration for these people who have taken it upon themselves to travel this long journey for an operation. It takes seven hours to travel from Kerry to Belfast. One 96 year old man saw it as either going to Belfast or going blind. One has to admire them for going in the dark of the morning and not coming back until late the following night. We need to assure people that medicines will be available. There is much concern that there may be shortages of different kinds of food such as flour. I was told often by my grandmother that there was a scarcity of flour after the Second World War. She would tell how glad she used to be to get a ten stone bag of flour that she would carry home over 350 yards on her back from where it was dropped off on the road with just one stop. When I hear talk about scarcities of flour, I think of her and what she went through at the time. The free travel scheme facilitates people to travel North to visit relations and friends and likewise for people coming down from the North. It is hoped this will continue. We depend on tourists from the UK. Many of them come year after year. They have always been appreciated and recognised as good spenders. We hope that, if there is a hard Brexit, they will still be facilitated. Any drop in visitors from Great Britain would hit hard many of the small bed and breakfasts, as well as family run and large hotels, which provide such great facilities. These businesses provide many jobs in the Ring of Kerry, the great town of Killarney, Tralee, north Kerry and even in the heart of south Kerry in places like Valentia. These places appreciate the visitors from the UK, as well as those who come through the UK to visit our county.	spk_258

Then we have the most frightening scene one has ever seen: a hole with props larger than any I have ever seen in my life holding up the bank to stop neighbouring houses from falling in.

I thank Fianna Fáil for highlighting the anomaly that arises in estates where residents to have to pay twice to live in whatever house or apartment they are in. The property tax is a contentious matter in some areas, especially in rural areas where homeowners do not get much in return for paying it, not even a water service. People do not have a public water supply in many parts of the county I represent and have to provide their own supply. We all know that the property tax was to be reviewed in recent years but that has been deferred by the Government because it was afraid it would get roasted in the local elections and in the next general election. It is delaying this review until after those elections.  We have an anomaly in Kerry in that all along the Kerry border with Cork, the people in Kerry pay way more in property tax than the people in Cork for property of the same value, however that has come to pass. We have highlighted that often enough in the chambers in Kerry County Council but that is still the way it is.	spk_562

We have a problem in rural villages and towns where business people and those who pay commercial rates and property tax have to fight hard to keep even the street lights lit or the streets swept. More often than not it is very hard to get the local authorities to attend to some of these villages. They are doing their best with the limited resources they have. People are angry in rural areas because they have to pay this and that charge, their property tax, their insurance premia and all their other expenses but what are they getting in return for that? They are being told now that they cannot drink a pint or eat a bit of meat. They are still driving over the same little bridges and small roads that were built 200 years ago. Some 800 applications have been submitted for local improvement schemes in our county. I do not know when we will get funding for the 800th one but it will be a long way down the road. We cannot build a hospital for the children of the country or houses for the people. People did not have anything in the 1800s but a railway was built from Killorglin to Caherciveen in two years. That is the truth of it. They have every kind of a system now, every type of machine, every technology for drawings, other types of equipment for taking deliveries and all the modern gear. Traffic was held up on the M50 for six months because no one could give those doing the work a plan. The middle of the road was taken over and the traffic was slowed down. No blame attaches to the company that was doing the job, as it was waiting for six months for someone to land with a piece of paper setting out what those in charge wanted it was to do. Lorries were drawing waste soil from the new children's hospital as the big hole was been dug out on the site. Only two loads of waste material a day could be brought by some of those involved in the project to the facility in Monasterevin, and that facility was limited to taking in 100 loads a day because Kildare County Council would not let it take any more than that. If Members are wondering where the money has gone, it has been spent on things like that. Another 100 loads of waste material was being brought to a facility in Longford. That happened because some environmentalist said the material could not be levelled out in some hole that could have been found and surely there was hole in this county to which that waste material could have been brought.  A wind farm project was being developed in Kilgarvan but all the waste soil from that site had to be brought to an infill site in Killarney and some of it had to be brought to Kenmare. What is the cost involved in that?	spk_564

However, one action taken by the Department and the local authorities is the purchase of second-hand houses around our county. This means the local authority is in direct competition with people who wish to purchase a house for themselves. The local authorities and the Department should be building houses for social housing rather than competing with private individuals who are doing their best to purchase a house and put a roof over their heads. Those people are up against competition from the local authorities. Moreover, there are no loans available from local authorities to renovate a second-hand house. There are no loans of €50,000 or €60,000, the kind of figure that would put a roof over people's heads. I ask the Taoiseach to look at those issues because they affect a lot of people.	spk_199

Everyone will talk about his or her own county but the nurses do an especially good job in my county, Kerry. I met the nurses last Tuesday. It was absolutely lashing in Killarney, Tralee, Kenmare, Caherciveen and Dingle, yet the nurses were determined. One could see the determination in their faces and demeanour. As Deputy Michael Collins stated, it was not just about them but also about the patients they take care of minute by minute every day. We need to recognise that nurses have to be properly paid. Considering the amount of training they do and the amount of activity their rosters require of them every week, they certainly need to be paid properly. I know what they do because they gave great care to my father and other members of my family who were sick at various times, just as they gave it to everyone else in their wards. It was horrible to hear of a young nurse crying because she did not have enough assistance to get an elderly man into his bed. She had to ask the man's wife to give her a hand. The wife could see her crying because she felt inadequate because she could not get enough help to deal with the man. The safety of our nurses is paramount. There is certainly a staffing issue. Half the community hospital in Kenmare is not yet open because it cannot be staffed. In the hospitals that are open, we just do not have enough staff, including front-line nurses. This needs to be dealt with by the Government. We have been talking about it here for long enough. Deputies on all sides have been reminding the Government about it but it is not doing enough about it. The safety of our nurses in the wards is important. Some nights ago, I met a nurse whose mother was also a nurse. Her three sisters are nurses. She is wearing a neck brace because she got hurt while working in the hospital. She will never again work. That cannot be allowed. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, to take this to heart and do something about it. It is happening quite a lot in recent times and must be stopped. There must be security within the hospitals as well as outside so this will never happen again.	spk_344

As Deputy Collins said, we had a motion here before anyone else, back in 2017. The people that are now jumping up and down about the projected cost of the hospital did not support us. Only 18 Deputies voted for our motion. We told everyone that it would go over budget because we understood what was going on and what was going to happen. It has done so more than we imagined in our wildest dreams. Now the Minister of State is saying it will be good value anyway because we will have a hospital. He does not care. He does not care because he is not paying for it. He did not have his eye on the ball and neither did the Minister for Finance. All last year the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, was watching the abortion issue and making sure it would be available by 1 January. He did not give a tuppenny damn about the hospital or anything else in the health sector, like the waiting lists or the people we take up to the North. They would go blind if we did not take them up and we are glad to be able to do so to ensure that in the last days of their lives they are able to look around and see the world. If they were depending on this Government they would all be blind. Some 25 buses have gone up and we are taking three more next month. There is a whole lot wrong with the tendering process, whether it is for public or private procurement. There is no law and order in this country. As far as I understand it, five companies qualified through the pre-qualification process which required them to have a certain turnover. Out of the five, only two were interested. They were able to talk among themselves and decide what price to quote. That is what happened here and that is what happens with a lot of the bigger projects around the country. Then we have small companies. I am talking about the small companies around the country that are out every morning working for the bigger companies. They do not get paid the money they are owed and they go wallop. So many contractors around the country were caught, especially in Kerry. One contractor went down for €20 million. He caught hundreds of small contractors that did their work honestly, provided the men and machines and did the work. Lo and behold, the contractor went into receivership, examinership or whatever it is. That contractor is working again, but the small fellows never got their money. That is not law and order. I can go back to 2009. It could be construed that I have a conflict of interest because I got caught as well. We looked to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. What did he do for the people? He did nothing. He did nothing for the small fellows who lost their money. It was everything to some of them. Some of them went down and never came up again. I struggled in 2009, 2010 and 2011 because I got caught for a massive sum of money by these fellows as well. We told the Director of Corporate Enforcement what assets the principal contractor had. The Director of Corporate Enforcement did nothing at all. He left the people stranded. He is supposed to be a pillar of law enforcement in our country. The Director of Corporate Enforcement did nothing for the people of Kerry and elsewhere who were caught at that time. There is an awful lot of work to be done to ensure proper and fair procurement processes in our country. They are not in evidence at present. Some State bodies now look for tenders on a five-year timeline. In all fairness, how can any small contractor look into a magic ball and decide what it will be able to work for in five years? Everything changes, whether it is prices, fuel or insurance. No care or consideration is given to people who work hard, go out in the morning and do an honest day's work. They are forgotten about and are not treated fairly in our country. Shame on the Government for allowing what has happened to the taxpayers of Ireland. It is the taxpayer who will have to foot the bill. I can tell the Minister of State one thing, those taxpayers are angry and they are waiting for the Government. They will meet its members when they come to the door and they will tell them where to get off. The Government has let the whole country down with this debacle and it will be remembered in 50 years for what has happened. The Government took its eyes off the ball. It was interested in abortion and all the other tomfoolery it was going on with. This is where we are now. The Government is letting the taxpayer pay for its mistakes.	spk_428

All our young nurses are going abroad and, at the same time, we cannot attract nurses to open the other beds in Kenmare Community Hospital. I saw the determination in the nurses' faces last Tuesday in Killarney and Tralee, where I was with them in the pouring rain. The Government promised them that when the country was turned around, it would restore their pay. Just a week ago, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, sat there and said he was going to put billions into a rainy day fund. If he has the money to put into a rainy day fund to save the banks or bail out the banks at a future date, he must pay the nurses first and he must pay the people as he promised he would do - he must pay them first. He must get talking around the table with these nurses' organisations with no preconditions, please. As I said, we need to protect nurses' safety and patient safety, which is at risk due to not having enough nurses and enough protection in our hospitals for them. It was sad to see the state of one girl who will never again be able to work after what happened her in one of our hospitals. I appeal to the Government to get around the table without any preconditions. We have highly trained young nurses going abroad. Why is that happening? It is clear they are not getting the right opportunities and that they are being treated better abroad. The Government must address this issue or it may bring the Government down.	spk_38

As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle states, I have only two minutes. The nation has lost confidence in the health service. There are so many different issues, day after day. There is one scandal after another. Deputy Harris will remember well, when he became Minister for Health, that I stated he was a young man and I wished him well, but I honestly have to say to him that he has failed in his time so far to deliver or to change anything. In fact, things are getting worse day by day, for instance, with the children's hospital. Maybe the CervicalCheck issue did not start out with the Minister, but there are radiology tests down in Kerry involving false negatives as well. We do not know how many people have died because of those radiology tests - maybe four, five or six. We are not sure. Even one is too many. There is the trolley crisis. How many times have we highlighted it? There are the accident and emergency queues and the waiting lists. There are cataract patients going blind who have to bussed elsewhere for treatment. We took a bus up, me and Deputy Michael Collins, on Friday last, and that bus was coming down when another bus was going up on Saturday. They are making the route - that is the truth - one day after another. Michael spoke about the late Emma Mhic Mhathúna. We admired her so much. She gave her last days in Kerry. She was bubbly. She was so popular with everyone, and in a short space of time, she struck a chord with everyone. It is so sad what happened in her case, and her family so young left behind. She adored them all. It is so sad what has happened. We are appealing to the Minister in that regard to ensure that this debacle does not happen again. I do not understand why we have to do these tests abroad, why we cannot have them done in-house, as with all the other areas, and have a service that we should be proud of. We talk about Cuba. It is a dictatorship. If a person presents with a problem or a need for an operation today, I am told, whether it is a hip or whatever, he or she will have it tomorrow. What is wrong here?	spk_594

Anything that helps to strengthen and ensure the continuation of this valuable industry must be welcomed. There are many issues we hope the legislation will address. It must first strengthen the industry and eliminate illegal activities, of which there have been a few examples. There is a need to regulate the sale of greyhounds both here and abroad. There should be guidelines for the keeping and training of greyhounds for reward. All of this seems to be in the Bill and we hope it will bring about a constructive process, with people being rewarded by the legislation's fair enactment. The setting up of the new board will be very important. We recognise the change of the name to Rásaíocht Con Éireann; it has been changed from Bord na gCon because of the problems with the old board. Many people were up here a year or so ago complaining about doping and illegal activities, so we hope the Bill will help eliminate all those activities and give people who love the industry and their dogs the chance to be treated fairly, whether it is in racing, training or whatever side of the industry in which they are involved. This activity is taken very seriously in most of our county. We could start in Castleisland and Tralee in north Kerry before going back around Ardfert and Ballyheigue and coming to Scartaglin, Cordal and Gneeveguilla. Mr. Tim Kelly lives in Headford and gives every free minute he has to the industry, despite rearing a big family. He works so hard, even with a day job and his big family, and he really lives for his dogs. He may not have many neighbours at it where he lives but it does not make a difference to him.He is just an example of someone who treats his dogs and takes his business so seriously. We hope that this new set-up will help fellows like him. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, we are so lucky to have the Kingdom racetrack in Tralee where so many people raising funds for important things have race nights and raise up to €30,000 or €40,000. It provides money for communities that need it, whether for sports halls or all kinds of different things or for people who are in trouble with their health or whatever. This racetrack is a place for them to make money and people go to support these race nights and at the same time get enjoyment out of them. Even in the heart of south Kerry into Cahirciveen, through Killorglin, we remember people like Chubb O'Connor who was a Member of the Dáil for 20 or 21 years. He made history with great dogs. David Cahill was very famous in Chicago. He was known as ""Red David"". He won fierce races in America and in Ireland. Indeed the great Noel Browne, who carries on the great tradition and works so hard in Castleisland, is a mighty operator and has won the biggest of races in Clonmel in the past year or two.  There are people who have given their lives to their dogs, to be honest about it. It is good that we are recognising the need for proper regulation and assistance for these people who provide a great sport – and it is a sport for people to enjoy. I am very proud to be involved with so many of those people around the county because they are great people. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, we can judge a person by how they treat their dogs and these people do treat their dogs very well. Hopefully there will be no place for the rogue operators. There were only a few but the investigators and authorised officers will have the powers to deal with those rogues and villains. I take this opportunity to wish all the greyhound owners in Kerry all the very best for the future. "	spk_708

I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that they get properly paid and remunerated for the work they do. I again wish to raise the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act with the Taoiseach which has changed rural Ireland forever. The social fabric that was known to the people of rural Ireland has been blown to smithereens.Before, during and since Christmas, many people found they could not come out, socialise, meet their friends and do the things they have traditionally done since the foundation of the State. Transport was promised. Rural Link was to get funding. Now we find it is still on a trial basis and is only funded until the end of March. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and Deputy Heydon promised they would provide plenty of funding for transport, yet there has been no extension of services as promised. What we have are plenty of Garda checks. It is not the gardaí who are to blame, because direction is coming from on high. This is happening across every county and every Garda division. People are being checked going to and coming from Mass. Last week an elderly man was stopped coming home from Mass with his invalided wife. What is going on is absolutely ridiculous. People taking their children to school in the morning and women who never drank are being stopped. They are outraged at what is happening. The Government has turned the people against the Garda with its instructions and directions. That is what is happening. I have to clarify one thing. Eight of us voted against the Bill because it was wrong. Some 75 Deputies voted for it and 74 abstained. I must correct Deputy Brassil, who said on Radio Kerry this morning that Fianna Fáil abstained. That is not true. Some 11 Fianna Fáil Deputies voted for the Bill. That is the truth. The rest abstained. Fianna Fáil abandoned the people who voted for it over the years. Part of the Bill hits drivers with provisional licences. Young people cannot drive unaccompanied.

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-01-30	dail	32	Juvenile Crime: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_30	I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. We, as a society, cannot tolerate or condone crime by juveniles or others, especially serious crimes involving robbing or beating up elderly people. There is a case here of one rape; that is not to be tolerated. We cannot accept those kinds of things. People may criticise the Garda for not prosecuting these crimes, but gardaí are doing their level best. We must go forward; we cannot keep going backwards all the time. Social farming is a great initiative being offered in Kerry for people with disabilities. It is being operated by South Kerry Development Partnership, involving especially Joseph McCrohan, Noel Spillane, George Kelly and Eamon Horgan in Kilgarvan. Many youngsters are brought up in an environment with no connection to nature and animals, and are not aware of how little there is between something being alive or dead. My uncle used to say there is only the breadth of one nail between being dead and alive. This is a great initiative where people with disabilities are taken out to farms and get to see nature. They see sheep having lambs, cows having calves, and horses and donkeys having foals. While I am not saying assaults are minor, where minor crimes are being committed, perhaps these youngsters should be taken out to see nature and understand what it takes to survive or stay alive and then maybe we would not see many of the serious assaults we are seeing today, some of which even involve people ending up dead. It is a great new initiative that has not yet been delivered in other parts of the country. The Government should explore it to see what could be done to get youngsters out of a routine of violence and hatred. It could play a vital role in changing their attitudes.	spk_325

People in this generation are paying for the latest bank bailout. The Government is now getting ready for the next bank bailout and is asking this same generation to fund that bailout at the behest of the Central Bank. I do not know how the Government is tied to the pillar banks. Of the billions of euro the Government wants to put away in this fund, €170 million or €180 million would set up community banking. That would have saved a lot of rural Ireland's post offices, which are now being closed one after another. It is very hard for people to understand what the Government is at. Is it trying to cod the people? On the one hand, the Taoiseach says to the House that he cannot pay the nurses and the young teachers. He says he has no funding for this or that service, for hospitals or disability services, yet he can find money to put away to ensure that the Central Bank is paid and the banks are bailed out if something happens again as it did previously. I refer to people with disabilities and people needing respite care. We have no services in Kerry. Not enough services have been provided for respite care for people with disabilities. I know many elderly people with a son or a daughter, people whose biggest worry is where their son or daughter will go. They are 75, 77 or 78 years of age. When they die, who will take care of their children? In Kerry at the present time we have no place for them at all. Why is the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues not seeking to use some of the funding the Government is putting away to deal with those important needs? We are falling by the wayside in dealing with mental health issues. We have no services, no facilities and no personnel. We just do not have enough resources to deal with people who have mental health issues. Sadly, so many end up committing suicide. There is too much of it around my own doorstep. That needs to be dealt with. As many as 600 people a year die by suicide. As I said the other day, if it happened on our roads, the roads would be dug up and grass would be grown on them. We would not be allowed to use them anymore. We have a deficit and badly need more funding for infrastructure.We have been waiting since 2004 for funding for the Killarney bypass. Killarney is choking with 18,500 vehicles passing through it each day. The little bypass we have is practically inside the town. We do not have sewerage schemes in many of our towns and villages. Kilcummin has been waiting for a sewerage scheme since 2004. Castleisland is waiting for a sewerage scheme extension for the past 30 years. Scartaglin and Curragh do not have sewerage schemes. Is it that all those people should go to hell? Is the Government saying it will put this money into this fund and everything will be grand? Is it saying to people in rural Ireland, ""Manage away""? I am not being personal in terms of the Minister of State present but it is the truth. The Government is proposing to deny the people the services. With regard to nurses and teachers, when the economy went bust they were told that they would have to suffer a bit for a while. If the Government has this money now, and I do not know if it has, nurses and teachers should benefit from some of it. I am very doubtful the Government has the money. To take one issue I have been raising here religiously since I was elected to this House, namely, rural cottages, under the Government's watch ten rural cottages will be built in Kerry over the period 2016 to 2021. There are an additional 50 people on that list. They will provide the site and all they are asking is that the house be built for them and as sure as night follows day, those people will buy back those houses when they get back on their feet. That would put funds back into the local authority and those people would have a roof over their heads. I cannot understand why the local authority is being denied the funding to build those houses. There is supposed to be a review of the tenant purchase scheme but that has been going on since I was elected to this House. That would put the Government back in funds. We cannot understand why people who are on pensions and could buy out their houses are not allowed to do so. We cannot understand what is going on. The Government is talking about social housing but it allows people to be evicted instead of letting the local authority buy the houses and allow the people to stay in them. In that way they might get back on their feet and buy them back again. I cannot support the proposal because people today are suffering enough. They need the money. There is no sense in putting it away for another bank bailout."	spk_336

Indeed, they have lost confidence in all four Ministers in the Department. There are scandals whereby people are dying. I will just mention the CervicalCheck scandal whereby women are dying unnecessarily. There is now the escalating cost of the children's hospital, whereby the Government is going to pay €500,000 for another report to find out what happened. Where were the Ministers for Justice, and Equality, Health and Finance when this was happening? In March 2017, our little group highlighted that the proposed site is the wrong location in which to build the hospital. The reason we provided in that regard related to the fact that the cost of getting the materials in and out of where the hospital is to be built will drive the Government's projected cost up to the moon.	spk_123

Like the other Deputies, I commiserate with the families in Donegal who lost their four lovely sons. It is very sad. I do not understand what is going on here at all. I am sure the same is true of anyone outside looking in here seeing what is going on. We debated a Bill to put money away in a rainy day fund and to make this generation suffer more without services even though they are struggling to survive. They are already struggling as it is and yet we want to make sure that we pay the banks in the next bailout. The Government had money a few minutes ago to put into this fund. Why does it not do something about these people who are in distressed situations and who have mortgage arrears? Fine Gael promised it would do that if it got into government again. We all subscribed to the ideal that we would help people with distressed mortgages. I know there are some people trying to milk the system. However, where a genuine family cannot pay their mortgage, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government should fund the local authority to buy out that house and rent it back to the people who are there. If one considers it logically, they will have to finish up in a house somewhere. They are surely not going to be put out under the bushes or on the side of the road. 	spk_488

It is about connectivity and people in rural and, indeed, in urban areas. Much has been said about rural Ireland but we must realise that within half a mile of the great Killarney town, there are many places that do not have broadband. This spells out what is wrong. There are pockets that have been left behind. If one was mowing a field of hay, one would start at one side and keep working around it until one finished at the middle point of the field. That is not happening with broadband provision. Pockets are being left behind and it is driving people absolutely crazy. Their neighbours have it but they have no idea when they will get it. That is wrong and no one can understand it. It needs to be explained. We talk of broadband roll out but we would have every field in Ireland rolled if we had the roller behind the tractor. Things have happened that have delayed the process but it is not good enough. There are other elements that come into play. The Revenue Commissioners are demanding that certain things be done online and farmers have to make certain applications online. That is the law and these are the rules that these honest, good and hardworking people have to abide by. Nobody realises that in places, such as Lorrach, Sneem, Glencar or the Black Valley, and in many other places, the only line they have is the clothes line in the back yard. These laws and regulations are affecting honest, good people. The Government is responsible for letting those things happen on top of not providing the broadband. It is a double whammy for these people. The connectivity of our mobile phone service is getting worse; it is not improving. If one was to travel a mile down any of the three roads from the Farranfore Airport, the only airport in Kerry, of which we are very proud, there is no mobile phone coverage. That is the truth and for people coming into the country, it is a disaster.	spk_510

I recognise their pay claim and support it 100%. I am glad to see many nurses in the Gallery. There are some from Kerry. We are glad to see them here and we support them 100%. We have three Ministers and a Ministers of State with responsibility for health. Deputy Finian McGrath is one of them. I am sure they are all well paid. We cannot do without nurses. It is a fact that many young graduates are going abroad because they can get properly remunerated and work under better conditions. I was very sad the other evening when I met a girl who I knew very well wearing a neck brace. She will never work again because she was assaulted in her workplace where she worked as a nurse. She tried to go back to work twice but has been told she is in serious danger of being invalided if she tries to work again. That is her story after giving so much to patients and supporting and working for our health system. We all know how hard nurses work. There are too few of them on the ground. We know the kind of pressure they are under. I was in Tralee general hospital when my father was there. There are always patients pressing the button, which is their right, looking for help and assistance. Someone has to come to them and it is the nurse who has to do so. There are not enough of them at present in our hospitals. I especially thank the nurses who work in Tralee general hospital, Bon Secours, Killarney community hospital, Dingle, Bantry, Cahersiveen and Killarney, who work so hard to attend to patients. I see the pressure they are under when they take over the shift and do their rota. They have to do so much paperwork before they get going that they are then behind because there are patients in need of attention. We all know the pressure they are under. It is no problem for the Government to give three times as much to the children's hospital as was planned. It is three or four times the original cost. That is what is happening.

Members are aware the HSE was put in place in January 2005. I and a lot of other people believe that since that happened our health service has deteriorated to such an extent that it is now in a total shambles. Nobody knows - I do not know - how it will be redeemed or retrieved or what will happen to give people confidence in our health system because they clearly do not have it at present. There are four Ministers or Ministers of State with responsibility for health. We have a Government, Taoiseach and President but we do not have a health service. We do not have enough nurses and the nurses we have are not being properly paid. We do not have enough doctors or consultants. I know of one patient who has been waiting for three years for surgery. He cannot get it because he is a public patient and the consultant who was dealing with him at the start went into private practice and has not been replaced. The man has to sit in an arm chair half standing up. He cannot lie down and he cannot sit properly. He has to try to stay half standing. That is the way he is day in, day out. There is no accountability. That is what is wrong.  Kenmare community hospital has been opened four or five years now. I give credit to one man and no other. That is Jackie Healy-Rae who fought hard to get that community hospital for Kenmare. Lo and behold, it is only half opened. It is not even half open because 21 beds are still not open. It is the same story for the new hospital in Dingle. A local farmer gave the Government the land for the new hospital free of charge and only half the hospital is operating at present. There are offices in other parts of it. That is what is happening in Kerry. During the roasting summer there were 22, 23, 24 and 25 patients on trolleys day after day. That is what was happening down in Kerry. What will it be like before the springtime if the winter gets bad?  The big worry I have for the people of Kerry is we have been promised a new hospital for Killarney but if this children's hospital in Dublin is going to double its cost, will the funding be there for it? People have to wait six months for carers. Elderly people like to stay at home as long as they can. They would like to die at home. That is what they want. It is not fair that people have to wait six months to get carers.  Look at what is happening with private health insurance. When a patient goes into hospital someone comes to see if they are on private health insurance. If they are, their health insurance provider is charged over €800 for the stay in the hospital whereas it would only be €75 otherwise. What is that doing to private health insurance but driving the cost up and driving it beyond the reach of working people who would dearly like to have proper cover for their families? It is not attainable now because of the cost.  People are in pain and people are going blind. We are taking buses to Belfast week after week with people having operations for cataracts, hips, knees, tonsils and many different things. They can be done in Belfast and people can get the money back from the HSE when they come back but we cannot do them in our own hospitals in the South of Ireland. Why is it? I do not know if the Minister of State is listening to me or not. I do not know if he really cares because he made a statement a few weeks ago that in 20 years' time there will be no nursing homes in Ireland. Where are we going to go with the people then? What will we do with them? If we are going to close the nursing homes, what other place is there for them?  I have gone beyond my time. I am sorry.	spk_405

Danny HealyRae	66	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2019-01-15	dail	32	Rural Crime: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_31	I am glad to have the opportunity to talk on this very important motion. It is important for people living in rural areas and perhaps not so rural places, as Deputy MacSharry said in his speech. It is a fact that gardaí were very effective when they lived in the local community. In many instances a house was provided locally for the sergeant to live in. There was one in Kilgarvan until very recent times, and then even that was sold along with the Garda station. Going back even a generation, the gardaí helped people when pressure was on them to save hay or turf. In their time off they helped widows or people like my grandmother, whose husband was disabled, to save turf and even bring out the turf. They accrued an awful lot of local knowledge and valuable information by visiting people, perhaps sick people or whoever else, and having the cup of tea and wandering around from place to place. There was not a thing they did not know or understand about that happened in their parish. Rural places are now very lonely and desolate at night, however, as a result of the laws that were recently passed here. I am sad to say that some of the parties here abstained on and more of them voted for the Bill in the name of the Minister, Deputy Ross. This has meant that roads from rural places are now desolate from 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. and open to criminals, vandals, thieves and robbers. Before if there was a fellow going for the pint or two, he would see something or someone. Now there is no one out because they are afraid to go out. They are like rabbits in a burrow, barely peeping out now and then because they are afraid of being popped, as it were, if they go out. It is a waste of Garda resources. I challenged the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality a few weeks ago as to why they were directing the gardaí in this regard. It is across all divisions. That day I asked why people were being checked going to mass. They are being checked coming out of mass now. That is the truth. It has happened. People who have never drunk have been checked and are angry about this. Even mothers going to school with children in the morning are being stopped. People generally are so angry all across my constituency about what has happened. It is unnecessary and wrong.It has changed rural Ireland forever because they do not have the transport in the morning or at night that there is in urban places such as Dublin. Our Garda chief superintendent, Tom Myers, said there are drugs in every town and village in Kerry. Does that have anything to do with the fact that the Garda stations in Lauragh and Sneem are being closed and there are vast stretches of our coastline along the Kenmare River that are open to the bringing of drugs into our county? Maybe there should be more emphasis on that because it is sad to see mothers and fathers bringing up their children, doing everything they can for them, sending them to college and then too many of them get drugs, which are too easily available. We should and could do more to prohibit and prevent that serious scenario that is taking place.  There is constant fear and concern about the threat of criminal activity emerging as a persistent feature of rural life. There is significant under-reporting of rural crime and growing amounts of farm machinery, diesel and heating oil are being stolen. It is impossible to take care of an oil tank. They are being hit by these people, more often than not, who take the heating oil people so badly need.  The cost of legal aid in the past six or seven years ranged from €49 million to €58 million. It is sad to think that the same villains who get legal aid in one, two or three instances get it if they have 40 instances, and in many cases they do. The Minister of State should examine this and the bail laws for people who commit crime and are out on bail waiting for court hearings who think nothing of carrying out another atrocious crime. The statistics show that they carry out most crimes as they are on bail because they know they will get legal aid. It is no bother to them at all. It is no bother to them to go to jail because they learn how to do worse things when they are in there. Many serial offenders should be locked up and the key thrown away for a long time until they see sense and understand what they have done. I want to thank those responsible for our community alerts and text alerts. These people do much great work for their communities with the little funding they get. I thank this Government and previous Governments for giving them a bit of funding, however small, because these people do tremendous work. They provide a sense of confidence to the elderly people in rural communities. I know of one elderly man who lives on a long bóithrín and from his kitchen window he can see the minute a car turns into his bóithrín. The minute it does he goes to an outhouse across the way so that he will not be inside the house if they are raiders or intruders because he got caught once. He will wait until he sees through a peephole who has arrived in the yard. If it is someone he does not know he goes out the back door of that outhouse and down the fields behind the bushes. That is not how it should be. The closure of the Garda stations, taking them out of communities, has affected people like this by taking away their confidence. We will agree that if the incidence of rural crime is increasing, more people are being hit because so many have left rural places and the numbers have declined in many of the places we represent. I am disappointed that the Minister put down an amendment to our motion.  We need to strengthen the trespass laws and the rights of farmers and land owners to protect their property and their person. These trespassers can trespass on land without any prosecution because there is no law to prosecute them. That is not right. 	spk_457

Parents are concerned about this.

I respect Deputy Durkan very much. He made a contribution last night but I am glad he is here now. I believe there are far more good parents out there who are concerned and would like to help their daughters. I heard Deputy Durkan's concern when he said that it could happen within the family unit or household. It has happened in those instances and we regret that. However, there are far more parents who love their children and want to care for them and it is only right that those parents be notified to give them a chance to help their daughter at a very traumatic time like this.

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-12-05	dail	32	Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018: Report Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_28	I am glad to speak on this amendment.We all feel it is important that a woman who finds herself pregnant when she did not intend it should certainly be made aware of all the options and choices, including, of course, abortion, that are now available for women who find themselves in such a state. In times past, girls were frowned upon if they became pregnant outside of marriage and they were shunned and hidden away. That was wrong and we can never go back to that. I believe that there is a change of mindset in the world today about women and girls becoming pregnant and having children. There is no talk about marriage. It is the baby and the mother. Tremendous care, attention and respect is given to the birth of a child all around us now. That is only right because we know of too many women and couples who try to have children and fail. It is a regret throughout their lives that they cannot have a child who would grow up and be with them for all of their lives. Couples have regret when they cannot have a child. To that end, I believe that a girl who finds herself pregnant and who sees no way out other than to have an abortion should at least be made aware that such couples would gladly appreciate a baby. Adoption is another option she should consider. We know too well of women who underwent an abortion and regretted it and would have chosen another route or option if they had their time back. However, there is no going back after an abortion. It is the end of a life and when life ends there is no magic to get it back again. Certainly, it bothers women and they should be made aware that there can be adverse psychological effects after having an abortion. Women who we met and who told us about it stated they will never forget what might have been and will be regretful to the end of their time for going down that route. There are so many different types of help out there. There are benefits and supports available. When women or girls find themselves pregnant, they wonder how they will support the child. They should be made aware of all the benefits and supports that are out there because they are available. There is housing and support from the HSE and all the services the State now provides that, regrettably, we did not have in times gone by. There are many different options available to women now that were not there previously. This amendment is important because it is important to give the women advice and make them aware of their choices going forward and also to make them aware of the adverse psychological effects that they may suffer after having an abortion.	spk_437

I see nothing wrong with it whatsoever if, by giving information to a woman or a girl, one baby will be saved. I cannot see what is wrong with that. All kinds of advertisements, advice and information are available. Why not ensure that this information is available to women in the hope we might save a life or many lives? Why must abortion be the only choice? I hear what the other Deputies are saying, and they are entitled to their views, but I am entitled to my view. What is wrong with ensuring we might save a life or a number of lives? Whether it is four, six, 12 or 22 weeks, if the baby got a chance and was allowed to arrive into the world naturally, the hope would be that he or she would live out a full life like we are trying to do today.

Women in such a state can have dark days and down days, but what if the information and supports were given to them? What if advice were given to them as to the supports available, the things they could have or the other roads they could go down? There are so many advertisements here about smoking, road safety, mental health and suicide prevention, and this could be a part of it. After having aborted a child, we know for a fact that women become very upset and suicidal. No one can deny that because I have learned it from people who had abortions themselves. What is so wrong about saving one life or a couple of lives? I say to the Minister and any other Deputy who is trying to say otherwise that I do not see anything at all wrong with it.	spk_463

I imagine we will get criticised for talking about this amendment as well. I will explain what I see wrong with it. The Minister is saying that the medical profession will have to refer on people. That is where the bother lies. If he was so sure that GPs could provide the service and that there were enough GPs, midwives, nurses and other healthcare officials signed up to provide the abortion service, there would be no need to force or bully people into doing something they conscientiously object to doing. I met some midwives in Buswells Hotel who came in to meet us. They were crying. There were two of them together. I picked a particular day. They said they loved their job.All of a sudden they are being forced to turn around because the Minister has not taken the time to organise teams throughout the country that will carry out abortions without being forced to refer people onwards.

They were brought up and taught how to protect life, save it and bring it into the world and all of a sudden they are being made to do what they do not have a mind to do. The current proposal has already been opposed by over 600 GPs, many of whom have indicated that they will not co-operate with a duty to refer for an abortion. The Minister has created a completely unnecessary showdown with doctors on a subsection of the Bill that is, in reality, not practical. As a matter of pragmatism, the country cannot afford to lose a large number of GPs, midwives, nurses and other healthcare officials. As it is, we do not have enough of them and we do not want to lose any more. The health service is a disaster in County Kerry. It has emerged today that people have died because of the neglect of the HSE which has failed to provide a proper service in County Kerry, in particular at Kerry General Hospital.  The Minister is forcing people to press ahead and requiring doctors to make arrangements for women to access abortion services against their deeply held beliefs. A legal challenge is inevitable. It is very obvious that there will be a challenge if this matter is not corrected in the Bill, which will delay the legislation further. It is very possible that it will happen. I am again asking the Minister to set up a team, if he believes he can, to carry out the service without bullying or forcing doctors, midwives, nurses and other healthcare officials to do something they were never trained to do in the first place, that they do not want to do and that they will never will do.	spk_529

This amendment makes it clear that she is entitled to make that decision if she wishes.

The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, succeeded in getting Fine Gael to support the Bill in return for his support for the Fine Gael-led Government. Sinn Féin was readily on hand to give its support. The Fianna Fáil leadership thought it was best to do the same as Sinn Féin. Finally, what happened was that 75 Deputies voted for the Bill, 75 abstained and eight of us voted against. Only myself and Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, of the five Deputies in Kerry, voted against the Minister's Bill. Last summer, the Minister, Deputy Ross, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Griffin, and Deputy Heydon announced some small amount of LocalLink services aid for Kerry. That is not enough for all of Kerry. The people of the Black Valley and such places need more, as do the people from around Cahersiveen, Waterville, Glencar and Beaufort. These places are remote and far away from anywhere. We need more transport services there and likewise in east Kerry, including in Gneeveguilla, Scartaglin and Currow.Will he provide more bus transport services in these areas? It is a different story in Dublin where many forms of transport are available. This is true of other greater urban areas throughout the country, but it is a different story in places such as County Kerry. The social fabric of rural Ireland has been blown to smithereens. People who need a car to get from A to B cannot even have one pint. Who is ordering all of the checkpoints? Is it the Taoiseach; the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan; or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross? People are being checked in going to and coming from mass.

They met in pubs to talk about farming, work or football, inquire about the health of neighbours or relatives who perhaps lived far away, or have an ordinary or usual conversation.

I am still asking the Taoiseach to provide the services he promised. It was supposed to be no trouble at all to provide LocalLink services, but they have not been added to. Even the ones that were promised are not being delivered. That is the truth. The purpose of this question is to see what we are going to do to help people in rural Ireland to get around. They do not have the train, taxi or DART services that are available here. There can be no checkpoints on roads around here. If a garda was to stand there for five minutes, there would be a five-mile tailback. It is very easy to have a checkpoint at a crossroads when people are going to mass on a Sunday morning, but I do not know what the purpose is, or on whose orders it is done. Is it being directed by the Taoiseach, the Minister of Justice and Equality or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross? I appeal to the Taoiseach to answer this question.

Also sought is the length of the pregnancy at the date on which the termination of pregnancy took place. That is important. The amendment would require data on whether the pregnancy was singleton or multiple, the date and the method of foeticide, if used, and where the termination of pregnancy was a selective termination, the original number of foetuses and the number to which they were reduced. Where a termination of pregnancy is carried out under section 12, the amendment would seek data on the condition affecting the foetus and the method of and grounds for the diagnosis of that condition. Data would be compiled on whether a live birth followed the termination of pregnancy, and, if so, the care given to the baby and its outcome. This reference in paragraph (m) is vital. I appeal to every Member to examine it because there is nothing wrong with it.There is everything right about demanding that the baby is properly looked after.

I listened attentively to Deputy Durkan, who said there are sad cases and serious, bad cases where young girls are abused by parents or guardians. It is sad when that happens. We all abhor that; it is very wrong. I am sure that we all feel for the girls in that situation. We totally and absolutely hate it when that happens. I honestly believe that there are far more good parents and guardians than there are villains and blackguards. The good parents who care for their children and who would not abuse them in any way are the people I am talking about. They adore and love their children, and it would hurt them very much - and it would not help the young girl either - if an abortion was carried out without their knowing about it. As Deputy Durkan said, we rely on the GP or healthcare official the girl attends in the first instance to do the right thing. That health worker might get to know that it would not be in the best interests of the girl to notify the parent or guardian, and I am sure that is what he or she would do at that stage. The law provides for a situation where a health care professional, a doctor or someone else finds out about something like this, and he or she is bound by the law to notify An Garda Síochána that such a thing has happened. The matter is dealt with professionally and legally after that, and there are rules and regulations that protect the vulnerable or abused girl in that regard, as I understand it. For the benefit of loving and caring parents and guardians, it is only right that they are notified in circumstances where the girl is aged under 16. It is right that they should be notified to ensure that they could adequately deal with the young girl after an abortion. It is an emotional time, and there are psychological consequences following on from an abortion, which are sometimes so serious that they will last for a long time. This is particularly true where the patient is immature. A person who is underage in many cases is far less mentally and emotionally equipped to make so major and irrevocable a decision as the decision to have an abortion. She cannot foresee the immediate and long-term consequences. It is important to guard against a situation where a frightened child might make that decision on her own at such a young age, without her parents even knowing, when that decision can have such life altering consequences for her. We have all heard of how children can get upset when they do not have the comfort and loving care of parents at certain times. They can have mood swings and get so upset that unfortunate, desperate things happen. We should legislate for the good parents, because I honestly believe that there are far more good people than bad people in this world.As I said at the outset, it is really sad and bad when we read about things that happen to young girls. Again this week we heard in the media about what happens to girls around the country. However, I honestly believe there are far more good parents and guardians and it is for those people that we should legislate. We are all well meaning and trying to do our best for young girls who find themselves in this unfortunate position.	spk_561

I want to reiterate the concern of many that disability would be a reason for an abortion. Down's syndrome can be diagnosed at nine weeks. We know that these children bring many people much joy, especially their parents, siblings and extended families. Many families love and cherish these children who in some people's eyes might not be 100% perfect although they are 100% perfect because they are who they are, which is themselves. We are all proud of the many local children who have performed in the Special Olympics in recent years. We must ensure that something like this cannot be given as a reason for an abortion. In the days before the referendum, the Minister promised that he would guarantee it would not be a reason but it is not in the Bill. We are entitled to raise concern about that on behalf of many people out there. I very much resent some Deputy here from Dublin, I will not acknowledge her by naming her, telling us to cop on.

It is a fairly reasonable request to ensure the little baby will not suffer any pain and that any avenues open to the medical profession are used to ensure these children will not suffer pain for the last few seconds of their lives in this world. It is a minimal request. We all have or have had people belonging to us who suffered pain. It is terrible to see people suffering. Many people in many families are suffering pain as we speak here.We are talking about poor defenceless little babies in their last few seconds. It has been proven beyond a shadow of doubt that they have feelings and that pain affects them. Whether it is anaesthetic or some other avenue available to the medical profession, it is not unreasonable to ask that something be used to ensure that they do not suffer. Being a Member of the Dáil is an honour. However, if we did not do our best to ensure these infants would not suffer pain by asking for this on their behalf, we would not be worth anything and our lives would not mean anything. I support the amendment. It is not too much to ask. The Minister is providing €12 million for the abortion service. Surely he can dedicate some of that money to ensure that the pain of these little babies, whom the medical profession has said can feel pain, be minimised so they are not hurt. It is not much to ask the Minister to use some of the money, wherever he got it, to ensure that these babies would not be allowed to suffer pain.	spk_408

However, they depend on us to legislate and put a sensible Bill together in which we would respect humanity. It is difficult for me to stand here, hour after hour, talking about ending life because that is not what I was brought up to do. From a very young age, I was taught to appreciate life, not to hurt anyone but to do anything that could be done to help anyone. Even with cattle and other animals, I was told that if I wronged them, it would turn back on myself. I refer, for example, to situations where I might neglect animals that could not talk for themselves or defend themselves when they were tied to a stall, needed feed and so on. That is the way I was brought up by my parents and grandparents. We are supposed to legislate and that is what we have tried to do. We have tried to ensure that common sense applies in the context of this Bill. It can happen that babies who are aborted end up alive. During my first year in the House, 2016, I met a woman downstairs in Buswells, as did other Deputies. She was 39 years of age at the time, so she must be 41 now. She told us of her experience. She had been aborted and she was placed in some kind of a vessel - a bucket. I am sure that is what she told us. Some nurse-----	spk_471

She told us clearly that her mother was forced into having an abortion. That is what happened. She ended up alive because some good nurse came back, took her out, saw to her and she survived. She came to Buswells to tell us her story. It frightened me to think that actually happened. We have figures on this but they are not as real to me as that person telling me her story. The figures indicate that, in 2005, 66 babies in England and Wales were born alive after failed abortions and then, breathing unaided, were left to die. This amendment makes sure that such a scandal will not happen here. Of course, the amendment will do nothing to prevent access to abortion but it will avoid the gross human rights abuse that happens when the law does not clearly protect babies who survive abortion. The breadth of the top of my nail is the difference between being dead and being alive. A small bit of extra attention can ensure that the person is alive rather than dead, and it is likewise with a baby. This amendment provides clarity and guidance for doctors by creating a duty to save the life of a child who is born alive after an attempted abortion. The Minister said to us at the committee that this is what doctors would do in any event. All we are asking for is to be sure about that. Heretofore, we did not have abortion in this country.The doctors that we know were dedicated and trained, and the midwives, to ensure in the maternity ward that everything was done to ensure that they would live. We know that is what they are doing and have been doing. This is different. This is an abortion clinic and all we are asking is that the same effort is put into ensuring that if the baby arrives out alive he or she gets every chance at life the same as the baby that was born in the maternity ward. That is all we are asking. It is not unreasonable. The Minister should not criticise us or say that it is unfair of us to ask for this. It is only a small thing in all of this Bill but to us it is a very big thing, to the little baby that might come out alive it would be a chance at life and that is all we all want, a chance to live as long as we can. That is all we are asking. Until the day I die, whether I win or lose the next election or the one after that, I will never be sorry for asking for this here in this Chamber because I may never again get the chance to do that.	spk_483

It is clear that he is not listening to what we are saying or does not understand what we are saying. We are simply asking for something basic and humane, which is that if a baby survives an abortion, he or she gets the same attention as a baby in a maternity ward. We are talking about two different places because when a woman goes into the maternity ward, the ambition is to ensure that the baby is born and looked after. We are not sure because we did not have abortion in this country heretofore. A number of us, and I am sure a number of Deputies on the other side as well, definitely met this lady across the road in Buswells. She told us what happened to her, we believe her and she gave us a firm account of what happened. Herself and her mother are good friends now. The mother was forced into having the abortion by another family member and gladly, she survived all that trauma. We are simply asking that everything possible is done and every medical intervention available is utilised to ensure the baby gets a proper chance at life.	spk_499

Records are important to ensure that doctors are made aware when a woman who has already had an abortion is about to have a second or third abortion. I am sure there are implications for the women in question and they need to be protected given the level of care they need. It is very important that proper records are kept to determine if there is an external reason for a woman having more than one abortion. On amendment No. 44, I have been asked a lot of questions about the issue of ultrasound and how a general practitioner would determine if the baby to be aborted is less than 12 weeks in gestation. Will the Minister clarify if a doctor can determine the exact number of days or weeks of a pregnancy without having access to an ultrasound? I am also aware that ultrasound scans are not available to every GP in rural areas. We are lucky to have such a facility in Kenmare but that does not mean it is available to all the GPs in the town at the same time. Will the Minister provide funding for ultrasound equipment for every GP? If so, will GPs be able to operate this equipment? This is an important issue. A woman or girl is entitled to see the ultrasound of her baby. Failure to support this amendment would mean we are not supporting a woman's entitlement to see an ultrasound of her baby if she wished to do so. It is clear that we should support the amendment. I ask Deputies to support the amendment and the important reason for tabling it.	spk_531

When the girl or woman goes to her GP and he does not have ultrasound equipment but her medical card only covers her for him, what will happen then? We need an honest answer to that. As Deputy Michael Collins said, it is regrettable that the Minister is portraying us as if we have no care for pregnant women or women who just choose not to have their baby. That is not true. We have, as we have stated, a high regard for life. Where the Minister in his role has let them down, we are doing our best to get people looked after in the North. A woman will need to leave Dingle tomorrow morning and travel all the way up to Belfast just to save her eye. We are doing our best to ensure her eyesight is saved. It is wrong for the Minister to say we have no care for women. We have care for men too because they are facing the same dilemma. They are not being looked after and they are losing their sight as well, as we have told the Minister in this House several times over the past two years. The Minister still has not made a difference or changed anything. He is just not listening. Maybe he will look after the people in urban areas, on the east coast or inside the Pale, but he is not looking after them where we come from. We regret that he made that comparison. I am very disappointed.	spk_571

It is very important because for far too long women have been treated unfairly. The further back we go, the worse it was for women. It is only right that where women are doing the same work as men, they should be paid the same. That inequality has existed for far too long, and I am glad to have the opportunity to support the Labour Party for bringing forward this Bill. We must recognise that women have played a very important role in all our lives. We would not be here if it were not for women. In the past, women worked inside and outside the home. They kept the home going but were hardly ever remunerated. My grandmother's husband was invalided from early in their marriage.She had to work outside and do all the work to cut turf for sale. I am so agitated when I hear people suggesting people should not cut turf because I know what she and that generation went through to survive. It must be recognised and made possible for women to be paid the same as men. There are many inequalities in our system, even now. Young teachers are not paid the same as teachers used to be or as teachers who work alongside them and were qualified earlier. It is wrong, degrading and frustrating for young teachers who spend five or six years in college but end up working for much less than people who entered the workforce before them.  Likewise, nurses on the front line do vital work. It is no wonder that many of our young graduates emigrate and take up employment in other countries because it is not fair or right that nurses are not remunerated for the hard work they do in caring for sick people to the same degree as the people who entered the workforce before them. They must work so much harder because of all the paperwork, liability and pressure that is put on them. They must work long hours and it is not right that they are not paid the same as the other nurses.  I am sorry to say that the Labour Party played a role in this issue by what it did to women in the home whose pension entitlement was changed. We are only now starting to address that but it was wrong and unfortunate. I met so many women who were not going to receive the same pension and they were so hurt because they felt they had paid their contributions but, as the playing pitch was changed, they would not get the same pension that other women received, and would continue to receive, alongside them. As these women came of pension age in only 2012, they were subject to the new regulation and it hurt them badly. I am glad this matter will start to be addressed in the coming year. As I said at the outset, women, whether they be wives, daughters or mothers, play such an important part in the running of our country and homes. We must ensure that they are treated the same and that they receive the same remuneration for the same work as men. It is great that the Bill acknowledges the great work that women and girls around the country do on behalf of men and their country. They are as proud of our country as anyone else and they have played such an important role, not least in past times of trouble when they cared for men. Circumstances must change and we must move on and ensure women are treated properly. I am 100% in support of the Bill and I hope it is brought to a conclusion as soon as possible. This situation has gone on for too long and it needs to be corrected.	spk_345

We respect the way the people voted but it is amazing to think that the Minister can find so many millions of euro at the click of a finger with no bother at all. It is a fact that we are taking people up to Belfast by the busload week after week to allow them to get their sight restored. There is no bother about arranging the buses but what is wrong and tough is that people have to leave places on the crest of the Atlantic Ocean, including Dingle, Cahersiveen and Valentia Island, in the dark of night to travel that long journey up through the midlands, through Dublin and into the North of Ireland to ensure that for their remaining days they will be able to see the world and see the countryside around them. We are not providing that service for them in the South of Ireland and I applaud the people who go that distance to try to save whatever bit of life they have left in them. Some of these people are over 90 years of age and they want their sight to be restored to them but we cannot do it for them here. When the Minister was appointed, we all wished him well. I said that he was a young man and that I trusted in him to do better than what had been done for the people of Ireland and for the people who needed medical attention before, but to tell the truth he has failed abysmally. We have asked him time after time to visit University Hospital Kerry but he will not do so and does not care. Things are in a shocking order there but the Minister does not care and the Government does not care about the health service that it is not providing but it will provide funding for this. I do not mind if people who cannot pay are assisted in some way but this will ensure that people who have millions of euro can get a free service. Why can that not apply to the people who want their eyesight restored? Why does that not apply to the people who want to be able to walk and have the use of their legs, hips or knees again? There is no hurry about that but this must be in place by 1 January. Come hell or high water, that is what the Minister wants. I have the same time to speak as any other Deputy and I am not hogging the airwaves or the speaking time, so do not let any other Deputies say that I am because they are blackguarding when they go out on the airwaves and say things like that. I am concerned that we are getting people up in the dark of night to travel to get their eyesight restored and we are inviting people to come down here to have abortions in the South of Ireland and we will pay for it. That is the turnaround we have in this country and I am very worried and disappointed that we are going that way. It is not about saving people at all but about getting rid of people. Deputies are hurt when we talk about babies rather than foetuses but when they are 20 or 22 weeks old, they are babies and they are entitled to live. We asked that if the baby comes out alive, it will get the same attention as a baby over in the maternity ward would get but the Minister rejected that. When we asked if we could ensure that the little baby would not suffer pain, he rejected that as well. It is all about rushing this through come hell or high water. The Government has not even talked to the doctors or the midwives and it has not gotten assurances about anything. The Government is rushing it through and bullying people into doing this and if they do not do it, they will be fired. Is that what the Government wants? Is it wrong for us to stand here and ask that those people who have conscientious objections be given the right to object to carrying out this atrocious act? They have the right but the Minister does not seem to want to listen and many of his buddies here are helping to rush this through. There was no pre-legislative scrutiny but the Government does not want to hear about that. It is case where if a fellow is not saying what the other side is saying, then he should not be talking at all. I am very hurt and disappointed that we are going down this route of paying to get rid of little babies when we will not pay to look after our people who want to be relieved of pain in many different ways with our health service letting them down. The Minister is happy to do that but I am not.	spk_344

It is not for the reasons that other people have because I do not believe in climate change. The climate changes but not for the reasons that people say. The climate has changed over the centuries, and always has, including when there were few mechanical vehicles or use of oil to cause it. However, I realise that we need competition and other sources of energy. This year, electricity has increased in price by 13% and gas by between 9% and 12%. The cost of fuel for vehicles has increased. Any other source of energy would be welcomed. This is a very good idea and I support the idea of microgeneration. Going back 90 years, in Shandrum in Kilgarvan, the Sweeney family made their own electricity and rigged up their house with a hydro scheme. They built their own little hydro dam to produce their own electricity for many years. If a family attempted to do that today, the fisheries authorities would pursue them, threaten to jail them and maybe succeed.	spk_408

We could do many things. I remind Deputies that there were salmon in the rivers at the time and there are not now. There is no doubt that there were salmon in the rivers at that time. We could certainly do more to produce more energy, similar to the people who came before us. If they were able to do that 90 or 100 years ago, why could we not do it successfully today? This is a laudable idea. I thought the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, could have been more supportive and have had more gusto. There are too many people looking at ideas and seeing what is faulty in them. There is too much apprehension about going forward. People have to take a leap and bring these things to fruition. I must mention a genius of a man in the Kilgarvan side of Mangerton, Gerry Cunnane, who made his own turbine. He put it together and has been generating his own electricity for the last 25 years. It can be done but people need a bit of help and maybe a grant system to aid them, with support and advice to get it going. We need competition and more energy because we have more people and more usage of energy. It is a laudable Bill. I ask the Minister to support it.	spk_410

In University Hospital Kerry the situation is no different. Often, when elderly people are well enough to leave hospital they are told that they should access the fair deal scheme and go into a nursing home. Many elderly people are reluctant to do this because they believe the next step is the graveyard. They see it as the departure lounge. We could do far better for these elderly people if more public health nurses were provided and if more home help was provided to look after these people in their own homes. Many of them would prefer that. However, they are only able to get home help for five days.That is not good enough because they are sick and need attention seven days a week, including on bank holidays and other holidays.

If this measure had been in place over the last number of years it would have helped many people and young couples who wanted to put a roof over their heads to get planning permission to do so. The Minister of State, Deputy English, and the Government are forever telling us what they are going to do to help people and to provide housing for them. In this instance, we are talking about people who want to build houses for themselves. They are not asking for money. All they are asking for is permission to build a home for themselves but they are being denied it. In places such as Gneeveguilla, Scartaglin, Castletownbere, Lauragh and Sneem the ground is heavy. Several proposals, whether for reed beds or otherwise, were shot down and people were refused discharge licences for rural cottages. Many people have applied for discharge licences. During a meeting in the council chamber I stood up and said that the council was robbing the people because it has not granted even one discharge licence. That is the truth. Not one discharge licence has been granted. The facility to apply exists but a licence will not be granted. We want change. The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, read out a speech that had been written for him. I know that he did not understand any of what he read out. I do understand it. Propositions can be put together and once a discharge licence can be obtained people will have a chance to put a roof over their heads. The Minister of State, Deputy English, said that there is a review under way of the rural group schemes and so on, which is fine, but the review will not include the issue addressed in Deputy Martin Kenny's Bill. Instead of opposing the Bill and tabling an amendment seeking to delay it until the end of 2019, I am asking the Minister of State to allow it to proceed to committee where it can be discussed with the EPA. The people who made the presentation in the audiovisual room today could also make a presentation to the committee. Southern Scientific, which is operated by Michael Murphy in Killarney will tell its side of the story to the committee, which is representative of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party, the Independents, the Green Party and others. We want an opportunity to thrash out the issues to see who is right and who is wrong. We believe that we are right because we have been told by the professionals that there are systems that will work. We want to give those systems a chance. We want to allow people the chance to build, including the young man who could not get permission to build on his own farm or a couple of miles away in another townland owing to the rural settlement rules. Is this young man expected to purchase an expensive house in a town at a cost of €500,000 or €600,000? He cannot do that, because he cannot afford it. This is the reason people are homeless. All we are asking for is fair play. I ask the Minister of State to withdraw his amendment and not to hold up the Bill so that people in rural areas will have the opportunity to live in their areas.	spk_469

I am thankful for the opportunity to talk about this important topic. I do not believe the Government when it said funding would not be an obstacle. I believe it is. I have my reasons. I have spelled them out here at different times. We have nearly 40 or 50 people waiting for rural cottages to be built. The people have their own sites but the local authority does not have the funding or the ability to give them the green light. With regard to social housing, the Department is holding matters up. There are four stages of approval. Private developers are finding it very hard to gain access to funding. There are so many levies and obstacles to be overcome.I am aware of one developer who is trying to start building houses for a voluntary housing group. The process has been going on since the summer with one thing after another. If it is not Irish Water requiring matters to be dealt with, there is duplication between the local authority and all the other agencies. There are so many problems. The Department is also involved. There is so much red tape. One would have the houses built while there is all this paper and pen pushing. Something must be done to unblock that. In addition, funding must be made available to private builders. There is a shortage of supply. People are complaining about the cost of rent and how rents are increasing. The lowest rent in Killarney is €1,300 per month. People cannot find that type of money. It should also be realised that the Government is taking 50% of what most of the landlords are getting in rent per month. They are paying 50% tax and something must be done about that if we want rents to decrease.	spk_443

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-11-07	dail	32	Apprenticeships: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_27	I, too, thank Fianna Fáil for bringing this important topic to the fore here today. There is a shortage of people with skills in the building industry, such as plasterers, block layers, carpenters, electricians or plumbers. Clearly, there is a deficit and it needs to be addressed. At an early age in the secondary schools there should be some discussion with students to enlighten them that to have a skill or a trade is important. I am not saying that people should not go to third level college, but it is not for everyone. There is a place for everyone on this planet. There is a place for those who go to college but there is also a place for those with skills and trades. There is definitely a shortage of people to build houses. As I said, electricians, plumbers, block layers, plasterers and carpenters are scarce. It is driving up the cost of building houses. We have spoken often in this Chamber about the housing crisis. When a company's tender is successful, whether to build one house, 20 houses or 100 houses, the problem arises of having access to people with the skills available because the jobs may be in one part of the county or the country and skilled people and tradespeople are needed to do the work. Since the bust, we have a reduced workforce. It is made up, by and large, of older people, with fewer of them, and they are doing the work now because we do not have skilled people. Likewise, there is definitely a shortage of drivers, whether lorry drivers or bus drivers. I myself know how hard it is to get drivers because we have a small company. There should be advice and assistance given to teenagers coming up. It is costly to do the driving test to be a lorry driver, an articulated lorry driver or a large coach driver and young fellows do not have that kind of funding available to them at that stage in their lives. They need assistance and the Government should be providing some financial assistance or supports to help them to become qualified in whatever field.For example, we talked about excavator drivers, who are very scarce. There is much that we legislators and politicians, in particular the Government, could do to help these people to give them choice. This should be relayed to them before they go to college. If they go to college, they usually stay three or four years, and it is hard to ask them to go back for another year or two before starting out life in the trades or becoming part of the skilled workforce. The Construction Industry Federation is calling for more apprenticeships to fill the gap. It states that 3,000 new apprenticeships are needed every year, but only one third of that number of places is being taken up. We should be doing something to encourage them. As I said, if there is a shortage of builders, mechanics and so on, it will drive up the cost of everything. There is a real need to address the issue of apprenticeships and young people in the trades and other skilled operations that have to be carried out to keep our country running. The hospitality industry is very important. We need an increasing number of staff in that area but it is becoming increasingly difficult to get those staff. In my local newspaper last week, I saw that a local restaurant in Killorglin was not going to operate for certain hours of the day because it could not get staff to keep it going. The owners decided that as they could not get the staff, they would cut the hours and provide fewer meals in the restaurant.	spk_380

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-11-06	dail	32	Water Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_32	I am glad to have the opportunity to highlight the needs of the people of Kerry who have been left behind since Irish Water took charge of much of the water and sewerage schemes in the county in 2014. I am glad the Lough Guitane water treatment plant, which services Killarney and Tralee, is now operational. The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, attended the official opening ceremony yesterday. That is one good story but we have a lot of bad stories in Kerry. Irish Water took over the water services in 2014. It keeps telling us it is only responsible for the maintenance and upgrading of sewerage and water facilities that are already in existence. It is not concerned with all of the places, particularly the small villages, that have no treatment plant. Kilcummin is one such village. It was promised a sewerage scheme in 2004. Funding was approved for the project in 2008 but then it was withdrawn. The road leading up to the village is in a shocking state. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the Kilcummin sewerage scheme is on the investment programme for next year. There is a nursing home in the village which needs to expand. The road needs to be serviced or upgraded and the people in the catchment area need a proper treatment plant to protect the Deenagh river and the lakes of Killarney.  Kenmare urgently needs an upgrade. A planning application for 50 houses was granted but the developer was told that not one house can be built until the treatment plant is expanded. There are many group water schemes in Kerry that are ready to be taken in charge. The elderly people in such schemes can no longer keep them going but Irish Water does not have the funding to take these schemes in charge and says it is not responsible for doing so. I ask the Minister to consider this issue and to work with Irish Water and the local authorities on it, particularly in Kerry where there are many group water schemes waiting to be taken in charge. We also need funding for the provision of new group water schemes, new water mains extensions and new group sewerage schemes.  The people of Castleisland have been waiting since 1986 for improvement works to the treatment plant and for an extension of the sewerage scheme to the people of the Black Road, Tully Road, Brosna Road and College Road. There are over 120 houses with septic tanks in the town of Castleisland. The village of Scartaglin was number three on a priority list in 2007 or 2008. The former Deputy and councillor, Tom Fleming, and I worked very hard in the Killarney electoral area to ensure it would progress up the list. It was at number three but where is it now? It is not on any list, programme or plan. The people of Scartaglin are deserving of a treatment plant. The village of Currow, a few miles from Scartaglin, comprises a council housing estate, a shop, a school and all that a small village should have but there is no treatment plant. What is happening? Each week, the sewage is being drawn into the treatment plant in Killarney, which is not acceptable in this day and age. Currow needs its own plant. The village of Beaufort is also awaiting a treatment plant. Many villages and communities in Kerry cannot expand or progress without a treatment plant. I ask the Minister to work with Irish Water. Many people have free water, free sewage treatment and free everything and the people in rural areas are entitled to these services as much as the people in Dublin 4 and other urban areas. I appeal to the Minister to address this anomaly because the people are entitled; they are paying their taxes, including property tax. The people of Glenflesk, Currans, Cromane, Cloghane, Castlecove, Caherdaniel, Boolteens, Ballyfinnane, Astee, Templenoe, Knockanure, Lauragh and many other places are entitled to treatment plants. They are being left behind but not alone are they being left behind in terms of sewerage facilities, many of them cannot get funding for group water schemes either. Everyone is entitled to a clear, safe and plentiful water supply. We must address this issue. We need a plan. The Department must work with the local authorities because these communities cannot be left behind.  Deputy O'Dowd, when he was Minister of State, was in Tralee to announce Irish Water's takeover of water services. I told him that we would prefer to keep the existing regime under the local authority but that was not to be. I remember asking Deputy O'Dowd to ensure that the provision of water would be kept under the thumb of the Minister. There is now a split or a divide, with one group of people being looked after and others being left behind. The people in the rural towns and villages and rural areas are being left behind. Irish Water is saying that it is only responsible for ensuring that existing water and sewerage facilities are maintained to a high standard but that it is not responsible for providing any new services. That is the anomaly that must be addressed.  In 2008 the excellent director of finance in Kerry County Council, Mr. John O'Connor, made the case to councillors that levies would have to be charged to new planning applicants for the provision of sewerage and water services. The levies that were put in place were exorbitant. The justification for the levies was that the council would be fined €500,000 each year until all treatment plants were brought up to scratch. Ten years later and the people of Kilcummin still do not have a treatment plant. They do not have a road either. The road will not be resurfaced until the treatment plant is built. If the road had been done in 2004, when the need for the treatment plant was identified, it would still have to be done again now. Imagine what the people of Kilcummin have suffered for the last 14 or 15 years. The road is terrible. It is like the bed of a river. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that funding is provided to Irish Water or to the local authority for the Kilcummin sewerage scheme next year. It is one of the most pressing issues in the county. All of the rural villages and small places to which I am referring are dying because planning permission for housing will not be granted in the absence of the facilities that are available to most urban dwellers. People in rural areas are entitled to the very same facilities.	spk_403

Many families that need a second car are losing the second car because they cannot afford it with all the costs, and wages and social welfare have not gone up to meet those costs.	spk_22

Indeed, they have reduced by 30%, and it is expected they will drop by 30% this year. At the same time, there has been a 60% increase in the number of farmers who have failed inspections. We are asking for a change in the inspection regime under the new common agricultural policy, CAP, where the farmer would be given the chance to rectify any problem identified in each year. We are asking that Ireland, if it participates in the new CAP, would be given discretion in this regard to allow farmers to rectify any problems identified rather than penalising them.	spk_159
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-10-24	dail	32	Post-European Council Meetings: Statements	dbsect_21	I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this important issue, which takes preference over almost everything else, and rightly so because it has so many possible implications. It creates so many problems for farmers and businesspeople, and virtually everyone in the country will be affected if we have a hard border. The British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, has many different movements and positions, and I am not just alluding to her ability to dance, for which she would not win any medals either. The problem is that when the English people voted in that referendum to get out of Europe it was basically to sort out the immigration problem that they have and that they still think they have.It is hard to understand how some sort of backstop would ever be accommodated by them. The MPs are clear there definitely will not be another referendum. That was what we had all hoped for, and I think I was the first person in this House to ask them to do that. It was the immigration problem that led a majority of people to vote to leave the European Union. If immigrants come here and want to use Ireland to get to England, if there is no border or some sort of checkpoint and they get into the North of Ireland, it is easy for them to access England. It is hard to visualise how we are not going to have a hard border when that is what the English people looked for and voted for. It will definitely affect business and jobs and even our fishermen who were badly served by the agreement reached in 1973 because it certainly did not favour them. Our fishermen will find themselves in a far worse situation after this. There is also the movement of cattle and of vehicles. Are we really prepared? Is this country really prepared? Is our Government making the necessary preparations for a no deal scenario? That is where we could suddenly find ourselves. I hope the Government is successful with a backstop for Northern Ireland because the United Kingdom will not help us. If the Government is successful it has to be a permanent backstop for Northern Ireland. As my brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, just said there is so much hullabaloo about climate change. We are only a small country. If we were to be totally emissions-free we would only make 0.13% of a difference in the world wide context. Consider Japan and places where one cannot see one's nose with smog and smoke, and yet we are closing down Bord na Móna and are considering stopping cutting our own turf. I spoke of this last week. We are trying to stop people cutting turf to heat themselves. What grander sight was there than to see the people out this summer cutting turf, saving it, turning it and bringing it home? Now they are able to have their own fuel but think of that in the context of the people who have to buy fuel for heating, whether gas or oil, the cost of which has gone up. Home heating oil has gone up by 30%. Look at the cost of that on people. What was ever wrong-----	spk_222

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-10-24	dail	32	Finance Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_29	"I am glad to get the opportunity to raise a number of issues relating to the budget. When we talk about the budget, right around the country people anticipate or hope that their sector or their cause will get funding. We welcome the positive aspects of the budget but there are many other aspects of it that neglect and do not adequately address the issues that need to be addressed. I recognise the extra spend that has been put into health again this year, but I am worried that, like all the other money, it will be consumed by the HSE. While I recognise that we have to have managers, it is evident that the HSE is top heavy with administrative staff and we do not have enough front-line staff. Our front-line staff are not paid adequately to ensure they remain in our health service to provide the healthcare that we need to provide for people who present as sick and who have health problems and issues. There is not a house in the State where someone is not affected one way or another as the days go by. I wish to highlight to the Minister of State what is and is not happening in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee. We have had five Ministers for Health and I have raised this issue so many times; for the past five months there have been no orthopaedic operations. There have been emergency surgeries but no elective surgery has taken place in the hospital for the past five months. I would plead this case. It would not be too much for the Minister for Health to visit the hospital and challenge the manager to see what is going on there. I ask that the Minister would meet the hospital manager. On two or three occasions we have been given indications that these services would start, perhaps at the start of September or the middle of September. Then they were to start on 15 October and on 1 November. Now the services have not started. I feel that it will now go into the new year. This is not good enough when elderly people are roaring in pain to have their hips replaced. I know of one man who cannot sit down; he either has to stand or lie down. That has been his story for four or five months. He cannot see anybody as no one will see him. Another person was so bad with pain for his knee problem that he had to go to Belfast last week to be seen and to get treatment. Earlier, the Taoiseach said that treatment waiting list numbers were going down. I can assure him that the numbers have gone down in Kerry for people waiting on cataract, hip or knee procedures. This is because Deputies Michael Healy-Rae and Michael Collins and I have a bus going to the North every weekend. People are brought up to the North at the weekend and they are being seen and treated during the weekend. That does not happen in the hospitals in the South where elective surgery does not happen over the weekend. Up North, healthcare staff work around the clock to ensure people are dealt with properly. It is sad to think that elderly people have to go away early in the morning and get on a bus. I admire them for wanting to help themselves. They get on a bus and travel the seven-hour journey to Belfast. They must stay overnight and they get seen to the next day. They then have to travel back again. One man who went on that bus, whose grandfather had his cataracts removed in St. Catherine's Hospital in Tralee 50 years ago in 1968, had to wait seven years for his procedure. He would still be waiting only I took him up to the North of Ireland on the bus where he had his two eyes done. This man is now driving a bus himself. That is the gospel truth. Tralee hospital is short of consultants, specialists and front-line nurses. We are told that the HSE will advertise for these positions - and maybe it is - but we do not know what is happening. People cannot say, ""My leg will only get bad when the consultant arrives"". This will not happen because people get sick and they have no control over it. They would certainly like to be well but old age and hard work happens. We will see how concerned our Minister for Health is in ensuring there is money available for abortions.There will be €12 million, wherever that was found. All of a sudden money was found to carry out abortions. There was lot of talk from the Taoiseach this morning about the Tuam babies and what happened there. What happened there was a scandal to God but what is going to happen to these babies? Where are they going to be put? What grave are they going to have? Will they have a grave? I have asked that question but there has been no answer to it. It beggars belief to think that we are trying to save people and get them back to health while ensuring that we are going to have money to pay for abortions and ensuring that we will have the staff to carry them out. It just does not make sense. Kenmare hospital is only half opened. It has now been there for eight years and it only half opened. It is the same in Dingle. The site was provided free of charge by the farmer who gave it and we cannot open the rest of it. There are offices in a good part of it. On suicide, it is clear that we are not giving enough money towards mental health and not addressing the issues in that area. The level of suicide in one small pocket of Kerry is such that there have been four suicides in as many weeks, or maybe a bit more. There is an average of 25 people on trolleys in Tralee general hospital. People are waiting to see consultants who are not even there. Again, it is down to the HSE. We just cannot understand it.  The jump from 9% to 13.5% in the VAT rate for the hotel, restaurant and hostelry industry is a major blow to all of Kerry, which is predominantly a tourism county, because in 2009 and 2010 it was the hotel industry and that sector that brought a bit of life back to the county, as did farming. Farming was looked down on but when the farming industry is going well, it brings up the rest of the community around it. Places like Killarney, Kenmare, Dingle, and, indeed, Castleisland and Crag Cave provide attractions and amenities for the people who come in great numbers to our county and they have been doing great work. The Minister of State must realise, however, that most of those places are closed from this time of year until St. Patrick's Day. They depend on the busy months to survive, to sustain and to improve their product. This is a big blow to them.  I and many other people thought that if the rate were to be increased, it should have been done as a gradual transition. If it was raised by 1.5% each year, in three years we would have reached 13.5%. People would have worked towards that and perhaps it could have been accepted. Hairdressers were outside the gates yesterday. They are also very hurt by the increase. It was a savage increase for them. To be competitive they will either have to forgo any profit they were making or, as one hairdresser said to me, they will not be able to take on young trainees because they just will not have the funds to do so.  We are worn out from talking about housing. Each and every Member here is as concerned as the next. There are so many reports and so many actions and different things. The Government keeps saying it is not a matter of funding. Will the Minister of State please explain why up to 50 people are waiting for rural cottages in Kerry and yet only ten will be built from 2016 to 2021? These people have the sites themselves. I was even told by one young person whom I asked about it the other day that nobody will even come out to see him for three years. Imagine that, when he has the site himself and we are talking about putting roofs over people's heads.  Rents have increased. There are a lot of complaints about landlords. I would say that 99% of landlords are fine, but they also find themselves on a tough wicket. If they get €150 a week for a house and are taxed at 50% or 52%, it means that they are only getting €75. The Government is actually getting half of the rental value of the house. The landlord has to provide for the upkeep and the insurance and pay all the other things to ensure that the house is standing in reasonably good shape. Under the tenant purchase scheme, local authorities used to always get a bit of money to do up voids and vacant houses. The scheme that is there at present will not allow 80% of the people who apply to buy out their local authority house to do so. We are waiting for the Government to review that and I would be very grateful if the Minister of State will explain that again to his colleague. Demountable homes do not cost very much but we are not allowed to have them in Kerry any more unless there is a fire or flooding. It was always an acceptable standard of housing for a lone farmer whose house went into bad repair and could not be repaired or who, for one reason or another, had a site and a place for a septic tank and everything. We are not allowed to have them anymore. That is a departmental guideline. We can only have them in the event of a fire or a flood. I spoke about agriculture this morning. The farmers were begging for €200 per suckler cow. They will get €40 through the beef genomics scheme but this scheme is not what it set out to be. Farmers are now being asked to weigh the calves and the cows. This is dangerous work that involves health and safety issues. To gain this €40 they will have to spend approximately €20. We are being told that many people are getting out of this scheme, and will be getting out of it next year, because it is too hard, overcomplicated and bureaucratic. We are talking about jobs. The provision of jobs is vital for the survival of rural areas. I, like other Deputies, cannot understand what is happening at present to the jobs in Bord na Móna in the heart of our country. If we survive long enough, this country will be all environmentalists and no one will be working if the environmentalists continue to get their way as they have been. There is now going to be a rush. We believe that all the Departments are going to visit the place and strategies will be put in place to see where they can find jobs for these fellows from Kildare, Longford, Offaly and Roscommon. I know one man who has been there since he was 16 years of age. He is now 59. Where is he going to go? Why did the Government - we will not just blame this Government, but the last one too - not talk to the people in these places and see what could be done to provide jobs for them if it was going to make them lose the jobs they have?It is absolutely ridiculous. What they were doing was sourcing what was their own and selling briquettes and turf. There is nothing wrong with that. As I have said today and other days, if Ireland was totally emission free, it would only mean 0.13% in the worldwide context. That is the truth. We are tripping over ourselves to meet these guidelines, the 2030 Paris agreement or whatever, yet in China and Japan, they cannot see their noses or feet with the smog and smoke. That is a fact. The Government will paralyse the people with carbon taxes and stop them cutting turf for sale in the midlands. If these environmentalists get their way, they will stop people cutting turf in their own places where they have traditionally cut it over the years. That is how my grandmother survived and that is how she reared my father and all the rest of them by selling a bit of turf to the local garda or whoever it was. They did not hurt the country or the world one little bit. With regard to the people who are still doing it, it was grand to see them at it this summer when the weather was fine. It is not so nice when it rains; it is tough then. It is wrong to try to tell the people in the midlands who were working in Bord na Móna that we will get some other job for them because the environmentalists are saying they are doing harm and affecting climate change. The climate changed back over the years and it is a fact. I will say it again because it is the truth and when one is telling the truth, it is not a lie. The temperature has risen by less than 1% since 1850. That is the truth. It is God's gospel truth. It has risen by less than 1% since 1850 and we are going to drive people down through the ground. We will make the people in Kildare, Offaly, Roscommon and Longford give up their jobs for these environmentalists who have these mad kinds of notions. I would say if we looked to each and every one of those environmentalists, not one of them has ever hired a man or a woman or has ever paid a fellow on a Friday evening because if they had, they would realise money does not fall out of the sky and that one has to work for it. Friday evening comes very fast when fellows have to be paid. If they are not going to be paid in the midland counties and if they do not have jobs - it is hard to see where they will come from all of a sudden - the Government and the State will have to pay social welfare to them. Everybody else who remains working will be contributing towards that cost. With regard to women's pensions, we hope the issue of the women who were short-changed in their pensions as a result of the 2012 changes introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Burton, will be addressed in the coming year. There were also women before that who worked in the home and who were never recognised and many do not get a pension of their own. They get paid on their husband's pension but they still need to be recognised because they played a part in the formation of our country. They are the women who brought the people who are running the country today into the world and fed them and reared them. We should not forget about them. Their numbers are diminishing because they are getting older. They should have been recognised in this budget. "	spk_307

I wish them well, and every good luck. I am glad to have the opportunity to talk on this very important topic. We all know that there is too much plastic around. It is a demon, and it is hard to control. As a publican I can see that plastic is everywhere, and it is hard to understand why we need so much of it. A few years ago every bottle in the pub was made of glass. They were all refundable, and if one gave out a few bottles for a station or something similar one made sure to get them back again. The bottles here noted wherever they went so that they could be retrieved. We have moved away from that. There was nothing wrong with that system. The bottles were brought back, washed and reused. Today bottles are either made of plastic or glass, but they are non-returnable. Coke bottles do not go back. Lucozade bottles are not wanted back by the companies. Many of the cider bottles are made from plastic. Six-packs are wrapped up in plastic and the bottles are non-returnable, as are sparkling water bottles and Smirnoff Ice bottles. People have no interest in bringing them back and publicans do not want to go out and get their bottles back. We have a great facility now where one can go into any shop and get a cup of tea no matter where it is. In most shops in most rural villages one can get a cup of tea, but we are inclined to bring away a plastic cup. People should be encouraged and incentivised to bring their own cups and reuse it all the time.	spk_344

The river needs to be cleaned from Gortahoosh bridge through Curreal and Glenflesk village up as far as Loo Bridge against Clonkeen. This stretch of the river is almost totally blocked with trees, silt and gravel which in the past nine or ten years has caused many houses in the catchment area to be flooded several times. Up to 35 homes in the area of Glenflesk are under threat or affected in one way or another. The houses have been flooded or people cannot get into them. In the last couple of days one eye of the bridge at Glenflesk has been blocked by a fallen tree. There have been many deputations led by me to the area committee meeting in Killarney and they have been supported by all of the area councillors. My daughter Maura led a deputation last May, a meeting I also attended and at which I was a spokesperson. People are very agitated and upset that the river has not been cleared. In the early 1980s Jackie Healy-Rae brought locals in a deputation to meet Charles Haughey at the Gleneagle Hotel and the river was cleared at the time. There were few problems for 25 or 27 years, up until nine or ten years ago. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, for coming to County Kerry last year when he saw for himself the problems in Glenflesk and other places in the county. He gave an assurance to the elected Members in the Chamber that he would provide funding once Kerry County Council had made an application for it. Last April the council applied for funding to clear half of the river. That is why we had to have a second deputation to get agreement that the other half of the river would also be cleared. A total of €168,000 is needed to clear the river from Gortahoosh Bridge to Curreal Bridge. Rivers - the Flesk is no different - need to be cleared and maintained all of the time. However, in the past 20 years landowners have not been able to touch any river because if they do, they will lose their farm payments. This rule of cross-compliance has to be adhered to. That is why the river is so bad again and affecting so many. Houses cannot be lifted, but roads can. The N22 was raised because it was being flooded. However, even though it has already been raised by 10 ft, it is still being flooded to a height of 3 ft. The river needs to be cleared. That is what we are asking the Government to do. There is a need for ambulances to be able access hospitals and people to access everything else.	spk_98

No person should be required by force of law to take innocent life. Irish doctors, nurses and midwives entered their professions to protect life, not to take it. For the first time in Irish history, a Minister for Health is proposing to force doctors to refer women for abortions. Forcing doctors to become involved in the abortion process against their conscience is deeply unjust. There is growing anger among nurses, in particular paediatric nurses, doctors, midwives and pharmacists because they were never consulted. It was said wrongly that this was GP-led. However, there was a GP poll and of the 900 GPs who responded, 75% said they do not want to participate. Theatre staff and gynaecology ward staff will be forced, and bullied, I believe, to do this job when they never entered the profession thinking this was what they would have to do. How can a nursing staff manager take over a 12-hour shift where the nurse leaving says there are three terminations of pregnancies going ahead, when the second nurse does not want to be involved in that? She is going to be forced into it. Indeed, two Scottish nurses lost their jobs for the same reason in 2014. I can see this is what will happen in our country down the road and we are not addressing those issues. Most GPs have no ultrasound service available to them and most of them are not trained to operate an ultrasound machine. If a girl presents and says she is nine, ten or 11 weeks pregnant, how can he be sure it is not 14, 15 or 20 weeks when he does not have that ultrasound service available to him? Where a girl presents up to 24 weeks on mental health grounds, and something happens with the father of the child and she is in a very bad state, what is the definition of ""mental health grounds""? This will allow for the abortion of a 24-week old baby. Only the other day I had the pleasure of seeing and meeting a baby who was born at 22 weeks, and he is perfect, a lovely little boy. The people I am talking about came into the profession to save lives, not to kill. What happens the babies who are born alive? Are they going to be saved once they are outside the womb? I met a woman of 39 years of age across the road from here last year. She was aborted and thrown into a bucket, and a conscientious nurse heard her moaning and saved her. She was perfect last year, 39 years later, across the road from here. With regard to foetal abnormality, we understand the case of the baby that has no hope of surviving outside the womb. To be honest, everyone felt for that situation, as I did. That should have been addressed on its own, aside from any abortion Bill. The Bill refers to a foetal abnormality up to nine months. How much of a disability are we talking about? This has never been explained or defined. Is it some child with a cleft palate? Who is going to decide that? If a baby that is in the womb for nine months is going to be aborted for no good reason, to me, that is murder and it should not be allowed. There are many Deputies here who have an awful rush on them to get this Bill through the Dáil. I believe the Taoiseach does not want to allow pre-legislative scrutiny, which is wrong because this is very serious. An awful lot of people around the country will be very hurt when they see and understand what is happening in the case of an abortion, and what happens to a little baby. I believe that once a baby is in the mother's womb, it is alive. Although it is constantly being referred to as a foetus, I refer to it as a baby. We are talking about this happening up to nine months. A couple of days later it is a baby outside the womb whereas a couple of days before that, or even hours before that, it is called a foetus and can be aborted. It is very wrong. Our abortion laws will be the most liberal in Europe. I respect the vote of the Irish people but they relied on us in this House to do what is right. If we are going to rush this Bill through the Dáil, I do not think that is right. On every little aspect I have raised here, I had only ten minutes to speak. This should be gone through in minute detail, not rushed through. The people out there are depending on us to legislate properly for abortion. We must ensure the doctors, midwives and paediatric nurses, who were never consulted, are consulted and talked to in order to see how this will be carried out. It is all right for the Minister to say, ""There is €12 million there. Do it."" That is not the way it should be done. We should go through it properly and ensure plenty of legislative scrutiny is given to the matters I have raised here tonight because it is very important.Many healthcare professionals have called on the Government not to force doctors to refer women for abortions. The legislation must be amended to remove the obligation on doctors to refer women for abortions."	spk_342
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-10-10	dail	32	Financial Resolution No. 4: General (Resumed)	dbsect_18	"I am glad to have the opportunity to speak again on this year's budget. I acknowledge the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, and the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Moran, who are in the House. Both are dedicated hard workers. I thank them for their input into Kerry. The Minister of State, Deputy Moran, has visited flood areas and has assisted us with finance, and is still working on projects. We are hopeful of getting finance for other very necessary projects that have needed to be addressed for the past seven or eight years. I thank the Minister, Deputy Ring, for funding the local improvement schemes. I asked him about this several times at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Community and Rural Development and I am glad that he acceded last year. It has meant a lot to what are called public-private roads in Kerry. They are not private roads. They are public roads but they were never taken over by the local authority and the last 100 yd. or half a mile to a person's door is the most important part. I appreciate the fact the scheme is being brought back. There is a request in for more funding and I hope we will get that in the not too distant future to carry on that very important work. I also have to acknowledge the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Doyle, who is here as well. He is working very hard in his role. Class 3 roads are small link roads that do not really come under the community involvement scheme but there is very little funding for them. They have been waiting a long time. Some have been in a desperate state for 20 years and some people tell me their road has not seen a bit of tar for 40 years. Many Governments have come and gone in that time. Will the Minister, Deputy Ring, address this? Last night I mentioned the need for the Killarney bypass, which is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, but I do not know whether he knows much about roads or has an interest in them. Nevertheless, I ask that the bypass be progressed because it would mean so much to the town of Killarney through which large volumes of traffic pass every day. For example, 18,600 vehicles use the current bypass daily. That is increasing all the time. I ask that it be put into a programme that gets funding. We were told in 2003 that it would progress in 2006. That is 12 years without a move on it. I spoke last night about the health service. Morale and confidence in our health service in the county of Kerry is at an all-time low. The Ministers have been told several times no elective orthopaedic procedure has been carried out there in the past four months. People are roaring with pain and are suffering. That is terrible. All the stops must be pulled out to ensure these people who have waited so long will not have to suffer through Christmas and into another year without being seen. I asked the Taoiseach about this on the Order of Business. Some 124 people have been assessed and are waiting to have a procedure but there are more who need to be assessed. We do not know the figures for them but they are many. They telephone me and other public representatives every day. I ask that they be treated in private hospitals or sent to Cork, Limerick or Dublin. We will be taking them on buses to Belfast in the coming weeks. It is not right that our health service is letting all these people down. I have asked that the Minister for Health go to Tralee General Hospital unannounced to see what is happening in the accident and emergency department there, where elderly people aged 80 and 90 years are waiting 24 or even 48 hours to get a bed. It is chronic. This is not good enough. We are told that in Cuba, which is a dictatorship, if a person presents for a hip operation today, he or she will have it tomorrow. That happens in other countries which have much less than we have. The Health Service Executive is top heavy. There has to be managers, and there are good people there, but it is overloaded with managers and there is not enough front-line staff. With the €700 million extra that is being given this year, will we see any improvement in the services for the sick people and those who need attention? I worry that we will not. It is more money but we will be standing still. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, was in here earlier but the agricultural sector is very disappointed, especially those in the suckler cow sector. They are very hurt that they did not get anything in line with what they looked for, or even near it. The story of the €40 per calf if a farmer is in the beef data and genomic scheme is of no benefit at all because people have lost confidence in that scheme. They see the quality of the beef sector reducing under the scheme and when the five years is up many will get out of the scheme. Those in the suckler cow sector are in a dire situation. Farmers are not getting anything like what they should have got at the marts around the county. Prices are way down. The farmers who used to buy that kind of weanling on the eastern side of the country do not have the feed to buy them this winter. When there is less competition at the mart, the price will not be long falling. To give one example, there was a man who used to take 720 heifers from one mart in Castleisland and when the mart telephoned him to ask why he was not coming to it he told them he was selling his bales for €50 a bale and was buying no heifers this year. That is what those in the suckler cow sector are up against. There is something every year. They are all reducing the size of their herds now. That will mean that in a very short time our beef industry will be in trouble because if farmers do not have the calves, they will not have the weanlings or the two year olds, the beef to sell to the factories. I was listening to Deputy Deering, a Fine Gael Deputy. He said there was unfairness in the market and we all know there is. The beef processors and the factories are not being fair to farmers. If he knows that and he is supporting the Government, I ask the Government to follow up on this to see if anything can be done about that unfairness in the market. We all know there is unfairness and that something needs to be done. The other thing that hurt me very much last night was the ""Prime Time"" programme. The budget was being discussed on the programme. It was like the word ""agriculture"" was taboo. It was never once mentioned in the programme and I watched most of it. I will excuse myself if I missed it because I could not watch all of it. All the time I was watching, however, agriculture was not mentioned at all. Can that be imagined? Agriculture was not mentioned at all on in the ""Prime Time"" programme on the national broadcaster in our country on the night of the budget. That signals to me and to people in rural Ireland that those people do not matter. What matters is what affects Dublin and the urban areas around the city. That is what is talked about and there is no interest in what is happening down the country. I can tell the national broadcaster, however, that when the farming community is struggling it follows on that the rest of the country will struggle after that. Farmers are the backbone of the country and always have been. They are not prospering and they are not being looked after and helped by Governments. I will not just blame this Government. Farmers need help just as much as anybody else.  On housing, there is much talk about landlords. They are being criticised all of the time. From my knowledge of landlords, 99% of them are fine. I heard the previous speaker talking about rents of €1,400 a month. That is happening in places - it is reaching that in Killarney - but more than half of that €1,400 is going from these landlords to the State. That has to be remembered. I asked here several times if some incentive could be given to landlords or some help could be given to reduce the tax taken from them. Give them some incentive to see if the rents can be kept down. The landlords have costs as well. I am not saying that €1,400 is a reasonable sum. It certainly is not but neither is €700 for people on social welfare. At the same time, the landlords provide the house, they have borrowings and they have to pay many different things. Out of whatever they get, most of those people are paying 50% or 52% because if a landlord has a couple of houses he or she is over the limit that brings him or her into the higher tax bracket. That has to be remembered by anyone talking about housing and landlords. Much of the cost of rent is going back to the State. I sincerely hope the State can do something. I have been asking the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to see if something could be done about this to bring down the cost of rents. I mentioned the tenant purchase scheme. It is being reviewed for a long time. When will the review be complete? It is very unfair because there was no tenant purchase scheme for a number of years. Then a certain number of tenants reached pension age. A pensioner now, however, cannot buy out his or her house even though he or she might have the savings to buy it and might have been paying rent for 30 or 40 years. It is very unfair that these people cannot buy out their homes. I welcome the €5 for pensioners and social welfare recipients. It is not much but it is still to be appreciated. The extra funding for the back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme, special needs teachers and the capitation grant of 5% is welcome because schools are struggling. I know this is not anywhere near enough but at least the Government is recognising there is a problem. We will keep pressure on the Government to ensure that funding is increased again next year. I turn to the €466 million taken out of the tourism sector. People in Kerry are hurting seriously from this VAT increase of 4.5%. It was thought, at the worst, that it would go up by 1.5% over three years and there would be a chance to get ready for it. It is an awful slap in the face to them. Many of these small businesses are closed from now until St. Patrick's Day. It is very seasonal for them. It is different up here in Dublin. It will not hurt the hotel or hospitality industry up here at all. Many people are criticising, and critical of, the rainy day fund. Those people are saying they are being doubly hit. They are being hit with a lack of services, more tax and all of the different things that have happened to people because of the breakdown in the economy in 2008. The Central Bank looked for the Government to put this rainy day fund in place. The Government is paying money back to Europe for what happened in the last depression and also getting ready for the next one at the behest of the Central Bank and the other banks. Many people are very critical of this. The amount of money being put into the rainy day fund each year now would match what was taken out of the tourism sector in this budget.  I welcome the change where sole traders and the self-employed, if their business goes wallop or whatever, will be entitled to social welfare. I raised this in Kerry County Council for many years. We had a promise from Deputy Joan Burton that if she got into office, which she did in 2011, she would sort out that anomaly. She did not. I am very thankful it has been done now. I see the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, is claiming credit for it."	spk_337
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-10-10	dail	32	Financial Resolution No. 4: General (Resumed)	dbsect_18	I know he was self-employed himself and that he understood it. I had so many people come to me crying about it and they were proud people. They had paid thousands and thousands of euro in tax when their businesses were going good. When they went wallop, they did not have a penny and they could not get a penny. It was wrong and I am glad that has been addressed in this budget. I am thankful for that. While I have been critical of what happened in the tourism sector and I am disappointed with agriculture and the suckler cow situation, I am very glad of that aspect of the budget because it was very unfair. We have been told that the tourism VAT increase could jeopardise 5,000 jobs. In Kerry, there are 6,800 jobs in the hotel and hospitality sector.If anything was to go wrong and jobs were lost, I do not know which companies could employ those people. Employment is hard to get in that area, and I feel let down by the lack of new employment coming into the county. If not for Fexco, Leibherr, Munster Joinery, Cronin Readymix and other private sector companies, one could put up a gate at the county boundary and at Rathmore because there is no new employment coming into the Kerry. I am very disappointed about that. There has been much ado about the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme. The problem I have is that one can buy a second-hand house under that scheme but there is no fund for people who want to renovate a house. As a result, people wishing to fix up properties are stuck in limbo.	spk_339

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-10-09	dail	32	Budget Statement 2019	dbsect_3	I commiserate with the family of Ms Emma Mhic Mhathúna, who have lost a mother and a wonderful person. It is sad to think we are speaking about the health service tonight that was not good enough to save her life and let her down. She was a wonderful person and the people in Ballyferriter made her their own. She was witty and everything that one would ask for in a nice person. Our health service let her down. It is sad to think that nobody has been held responsible for what happened to Emma and many other women like her. If somebody's life was neglected or lost like this in any other system, somebody would be brought to account. It is time to call in the special branches of the Garda to see what happened and get a fair assessment. We must bring somebody to account for what happened in these sad cases. It is sad to think other women are out there with a death sentence hanging over them. They know they will die as well. The Minister allocated €700 million more to the health service, bringing the total extra allocation for the year to €1.2 billion, but will it make a difference to those people waiting on trolleys? In Kerry general hospital this year there was an average of 25 people day after day waiting on trolleys before they could get a bed. Will it make a difference to people waiting for procedures for hips and knees? These are people roaring with pain for the past four months and we have been asking about their treatment here day after day since we came back. We want the orthopaedic section of Tralee general hospital open again but it is still not open. Will it make a difference to the hundreds of people who still must travel to the North to get cataracts removed? This month Deputy Michael Collins and I will take two buses full of people. We will take two buses in November and another bus in December. We have taken people up all year.Will it make a difference to front-line staff who are clearly overworked? We need more nurses but cannot recruit them. Will nurses be paid properly? Will doctors and consultants be paid properly so that we will have a proper complement in University Hospital Kerry? Will this money open the six beds in Dingle Community Hospital that are closed? Will it open the other half of the new community hospital in Kenmare, only half of which has been open since the opening of the hospital?  Will it make a difference in mental health where there is clearly an underspend and half the people are not being seen? In our neck of the woods, I am sad to say that we are losing people practically every week to suicide. No proper attempt is being made with the mental health services.  Medical cards are so difficult to get. We all know the farmers or business people who are working for themselves - the self-employed - never think about health insurance or getting a medical card until they actually get sick. They have a stroke or heart attack, are in the hospital, apply for a medical card and are there for a number of weeks before the medical card comes but the medical card will not pay for the bill that is outstanding or has accrued since the patient went into hospital. I again ask that the medical card cover the person from the date they apply for it. If they are entitled to it, it should apply from the date on which they applied for it.  While there was some small improvement with the fair deal scheme in respect of capping the number of years, the scheme is very unfair on farmers. The entire value of the farm is assessed in deciding whether the person will be entitled to the fair deal. Paying back all that money is too onerous on the young man taking over when the entire value of the farm is assessed.  In August, the IFA made several representations about €200 for suckler cow farmers because they are under savage pressure. We think they are getting about €40 but we are being told that it will be so difficult to get that it may not be worth the trouble. We asked for €5 for the hillside sheep men and got nothing. There is money for forestry, which is welcome if the Government deals with the blockages in forestry where a farmer will only get a grant for his or her forestry if it is 80% green ground. It is the other way round on many farms. It is 80% the other way and only 20% is green ground.  We do not have enough gardaí in rural areas minding our very isolated people. I know of two brothers who moved out of their house because they had been broken into and moved in with their nephew. There is a lot of talk here about climate change. It is ridiculous because if we deal with just one aspect of it, the temperature in Ireland has only increased by less than one degree since 1815. There is an awful lot of hullabaloo and talk about how we must do this, increase carbon taxes and put more pressure on hard-working people.  The tourism sector has been dealt an awful blow by the addition of 4.5% to the VAT rate taking it from 9% to 13.5%. It is taking €466 million out of this sector. The stimulus was given in 2011 when the sector was on its knees and helped turn the country around in a big way. It was a big help to Kerry and created employment in hotels in Killarney, Dingle and Kenmare and residences all around the Ring of Kerry. Increasing the VAT rate could have a very serious adverse impact on this industry. I wonder where the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and the famous Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, were when this was being decided. What were they at while this was being put into the budget? For employers in the private sector, including hoteliers, Friday evening is not long in coming when they are paying staff, as the weeks go around very quickly. People in the public sector do not realise it but in the private sector, Friday evening comes around very quickly for employers and the self-employed.  Much has been said about housing. There is a four-stage approval process for projects costing over €2 million. While, there is a one-stage approval process for projects costing under €2 million, that will only build eight houses in Kerry, whatever about Dublin. It might build only one house in Dublin. We will get ten rural cottages from 2016 to 2021. The Land Development Agency will be just another layer of bureaucracy. The tenant purchase scheme has been under review for the past two and a half years and there is no account of it. Older people who have paid rent for the past 20 or 30 years and who might have saved a bit of money are not allowed to buy their houses. The Government is buying houses instead of building them and is competing with youngsters who are trying to buy houses. The Government should build its own houses and not compete in the private market with young people who are trying to buy a house and put a roof over the heads. The Government is limiting the amount of land being zoned, which is giving a monopoly to some.  We are urgently looking for the Killarney bypass to be reactivated and put on a programme because Killarney is being choked by traffic in the summer. In one way, it is good. It sends a signal that the county is booming but it not fair to people parking their cars on a warm summer evening when trying to get into the town of Killarney, which is what is happening. It is regrettable that a decision was taken to close the post offices when the Dáil was in recess. It is depriving small parishes of the identity they were proud to hold and loved dearly. 	spk_129
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-10-09	dail	32	Financial Resolution No. 3: Value-Added Tax	dbsect_17	This is a savage attack on rural Ireland. Dublin and the big urban centres are not hurting. This a direct attack on small businesses in County Kerry. If one looks at any part of the Ring of Kerry or any rural area in County Kerry where there is a small guest house, bed and breakfast accommodation and a small restaurant, one will see that they will struggle to keep the doors open between now and St. Patrick's Day. They face an uphill struggle and things are bad enough without hitting them with this savage tax as they have no way of making the money up. They cannot increase their rates because they would not be competitive. They still have to pay their employees.As I said earlier in the day, when one is an employer Friday evening comes very fast and one must find the money to pay everyone. I am very surprised by what has happened. I believed we were safe when we had a Minister of State from my constituency. I did not or would not expect anything from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, because he is totally against rural Ireland. I cannot understand what has gone wrong with the Government because it was the reduction in the VAT rate that bailed out the sector and helped it to survive and keep going.	spk_204

Nurses throughout the country are under severe pressure, both mentally and physically. In the first place I am asking the Taoiseach to take County Kerry as an example. An extra 43 beds are needed, but we need 60 nurses to man them. Six beds are closed in Dingle because we do not have enough nurses. They are looking to recruit six nurses there. Nurses are under so much pressure. I will highlight just one case.

I do not know what he has or does not have but I must also declare an interest. He does not tell me anyway. The Minister and the Government have said all along that money was not the problem in the building of houses, but it must be a problem. In Kerry, we are limited to building two rural cottages a year from 2016 to 2021. That is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. That is not enough for us and there is, therefore, something wrong in terms of money. There was much talk this morning between the leader of Fianna Fáil and the Minister on the stages of approval required by the Department. As I understand it, a single stage approval can only be given if the project does not cost more than €2 million. Is the Minister listening to me? A single stage approval is possible only if the project does not cost more than €2 million. That would amount to eight houses in Kerry, but it may only build four houses in Dublin, I do not know. Single stage approval, however, does not comply with the Department of Finance guidelines on value for money. The Minister is aware of this and if he is asked the question properly, he must tell the questioner this. In every other instance there are four stages of planning approval. We highlighted this to the previous Minister but he obviously did not listen. This is why time has been lost. In Kerry, if a development exceeds eight houses, it needs four stages of planning approval. In Dublin, that may apply to developments of only two or three houses. The Minister must review what is happening in the Department in this regard. It is very wrong of the Minister or anybody else to blame the local authorities. There were murmurs here this morning blaming the local authorities. They are not to blame. The Department is to blame for the delay with the stages of planning approval and that is where the delays must be tackled. The Minister is in charge of the Department and he must bring it to task and bring it around because that is where the delay is.	spk_493

This is another attack on rural Ireland, or what is left of it. I am a publican and I make no bones about that fact.

The Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, probably understands that most villages have only one pub and one shop. There are not too many places that GAA clubs can go within their communities in order to try to attract support. What is proposed will deny those clubs an option. We are referring to the GAA in rural communities in this context. To deny a GAA club the option of going to the local pub to obtain sponsorship is deplorable. I hope the Minister is opposed to the amendment. Denying clubs a chance to get sponsorship from the local publican - whoever he or she may be - is an almighty attack on GAA clubs. This will break up whole rural communities, villages and small parishes. Small GAA clubs in rural areas face a desperate task in trying to retain their identities and even in trying to get enough players to field teams. Consider the great village of Sneem, from where the great John Egan came. John Egan feared nobody in any county, in Croke Park or wherever he played. The village of Sneem has had to join up with Castlecove and Caherdaniel in order to field a team. In south Kerry and along the Ring of Kerry, it is a struggle to even make up the numbers in schools. Only two new children enrolled in one of the schools in south Kerry this year. Where will the sponsorship come for local clubs if publicans are deprived of the opportunity to provide sponsorship? They are doing their best. GAA officers are trying to keep the game going and to keep children involved. It is absolutely ridiculous that it would even be suggested that the link between local business people and GAA clubs should be broken. What is proposed is terrible and it is shameful. I do not have the words to describe how bad it is. This is a real attack on rural Ireland. The Minister will be reminded of it when his fellow Deputies are on the canvass. If the Minister stops publicans from giving a few bob to their local GAA clubs, he will hear about it and he will be bullyragged about it everywhere he goes. This is a really serious attack on rural Ireland. The Minister will never be forgotten if he does this to the people in rural villages and small towns.	spk_660

I did say that it would hurt people in rural areas more because in a rural parish or village there are perhaps only four or five businesses that can be approached for sponsorship. There may be one shop, one pub and perhaps a couple of other people that a club can approach so the proposed amendment would have affected rural areas in a more adverse way. More goes on in a pub than the consumption of alcohol. People go to pubs for different reasons. One of them is that it is a place to meet because there are not too many places in a rural area where people can meet to have a cup of tea.	spk_686

It is very welcome. I have to talk about suicide because it is a demon which has affected many families. Everyone talks about their own place. In Kerry, we have had too much of it. Teenagers have pressures in schools and colleges, then people fear becoming homeless and have financial worries and family problems. There are many different pressures which cause mental illness. It is hard for us to understand someone who has a mental illness. It is a real problem. The problem in our county is that we do not have a 24-hour service. If someone presents at the weekend, as they often do in emergency departments, there is no real help for them. I remember getting a call a few months ago from a family on a Friday evening. Their brother was told that he was going home and there was no place for him. I will not say which hospital. Families recognise when a member of the family is in trouble. This family had lost another family member and knew that they were in bother with this person. Gladly, he was kept there after an intervention and that boy is perfect. That did not happen for others and there are family members who are very sore and hurt about it. We do not have enough services. Many of these youngsters - they are youngsters, by and large - need one-to-one care. Families are tied up. They have other commitments, children of their own and other matters. We do not have the services to prevent many of the suicides that I believe could have been prevented. I appeal to the Minister of State because this affects vulnerable people. My uncle used to say that there is only the breadth of a nail between being dead and alive. It is a defining moment when someone commits suicide, with all that it brings with it, with so much hurt and loss for a family, and stigma too. We have to do more for people with mental illnesses.	spk_317

However, this Bill has gone all over the place, proposing to cover bottles with cancer warnings, among other things.This amendment would mean that people could not have a drink without being charged for it. I want to make a few points on this. Many retrograde things have happened to rural Ireland since I came here. In rural Ireland, there is a thing called a wake. People go to wakes and stay with the family for a few hours, and a few drinks are given to the guests. Are we going to police an event like that, so that a person cannot take a drink at a wake? In rural Ireland there is also something called a station, where mass is said in a house. Each house's turn comes around after four or five years. A few drinks are provided. However, as the Deputy said, to take a drink or not is a person's choice. I do not drink but I have nothing against those who do. The word is ""moderation"". This amendment is open to an interpretation whereby opening ceremonies or book launches, where a glass of wine is provided, would be illegal. Rural Ireland has a thing called a ball night at which a locality or a parish celebrates. People dance and play music and drinks are available that do not have to be paid for. They are paid for by the people who organise the ball night. Likewise there are Biddy balls. I do not know if Members know what a Biddy ball is."	spk_436

It has been said that it is not in this amendment but I will talk about it, because it is fairly ridiculous and stupid. It will also be fairly hurtful if it goes through. It looks to me as though some people have gone stone mad. Again, a person makes a choice about whether they want to have a drink. The choice is theirs.

No other county in Ireland has a higher percentage of people employed in the drinks and hospitality sector. The drinks industry is the lifeblood of many communities. Elected representatives must do everything they can to protect those jobs and that is what we are attempting to do and will continue to try to do. We are elected to make sure the Government is aware that what it is doing is wrong. There is no necessity in the world for this measure. We all want to tackle the problem of harmful and underage drinking, which was the purpose of the Bill when introduced a number of years ago but it has now deviated from that objective in terms of the labelling provisions and what is proposed for supermarkets and so on. No other country in the world has mandatory cancer warnings on alcohol products. This measure applies a stigma to products made in Ireland and damages our reputation as a country that produces recognised quality products of international standing. The reputational damage to this category could be huge in Ireland and in export markets, undoing all the hard work of recent years. Several foods such as red meat, sausages, bacon and ham have been classified as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. If Ireland requires the inclusion of cancer warnings on alcohol it is likely that similar requirements will be introduced for foods, which is of serious concern to Irish food processors. It is about everything in moderation. Alcohol in moderation does no harm to anybody. Will this measure stop people who drink excessively? It will not. It is a gimmick on the part of the Minister for Health and the Government to make people think they are doing something about excessive drinking. This measure will not stop underage or excessive drinking, which is what we started out to do, but we have now moved away from that.People have drunk alcohol for years and drinking plays an important role in sustaining socially supportive friendship networks, improving happiness and combating loneliness and isolation. Maybe people living in or near cities do not know about loneliness and isolation but in rural areas people have little else to do but have a few drinks for company's sake. That is as it ever was. It is ridiculous what the Government is doing because Scotch whisky and whiskey from other parts of the world will not have the cancer warning.	spk_539

I am concerned for small breweries, such as Killarney brewery and the Dingle Brewery Company, that it will affect them adversely or reverse the progress that has been made and the jobs that they have provided. If one goes back six years to when the Dingle Brewery Company started up, there were not many jobs in Dingle at that time. The people there are glad of the employment that the brewery provides all year round. They are also glad that it has become a tourist attraction. What is proposed in the Bill will have an adverse effect on those people and on jobs in Dingle. Likewise, any time I pass the Killarney brewery on the Muckross Road there seems to be a crowd being taken on a tour of the place. It is proper that I record my concern, on behalf of the people who have developed those businesses and their employees. There is no need for this. It will have no beneficial effect for the youngsters. When this Bill was being drawn up first, it was to help prevent the abuse of alcohol by youngsters and binge drinking. I cannot see what is the connection between binge drinking and tourists coming like that to our country who for one hour may visit these places. It is ridiculous. What the Government is doing is preposterous. These visitors may even only stay for a half an hour. I do not know how this is to be of any benefit in stopping underage drinking or excessive drinking.

I am still asking for that and many people around the country hope that at the last minute, they will hold another referendum and that the result would be to remain. For farmers, particularly in disadvantaged areas, Brexit becoming a reality will have a detrimental effect on so many. Some say that many will be wiped out and that farming as we know it in disadvantaged rural areas will be lost forever. Worry over Brexit has meant that the price of cattle has already fallen. The price of cattle is very bad.Business people are worried about changes in the value of sterling. People with small industries who export to the North of Ireland and the United Kingdom are already losing money because of the cost of sterling. We are worried that the cross-border directive, which we use frequently to bring patients to the North to get cataracts removed from their eyes and thereby prevent them from losing their sight, will cease or will not work for us anymore when Brexit becomes a reality. Many people would have gone blind by this stage if we had not been able to take them to the North on buses over the last 12 or 18 months.

The Department is slowing down local authorities with too many hurdles. In Kerry, ten rural cottages are to be built between 2016 and 2021. People are providing their own sites. Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae received a reply in a notice of motion at a council meeting the other day and I also received it. People who begin to look for a rural cottage now will have to wait three years before somebody will come out to them because the funding is not there. That is wrong. Demountable homes are all over Kerry for single farmers who finish up in a house that is not good enough to live in but we cannot get any more of them. The Taoiseach did not know what I was speaking about when I mentioned demountable homes. The Government will not allow the local authority to zone enough land, and what is happening is that one piece of land is developed and that developer has the monopoly to charge what he or she likes for the houses built on it. There should be competition. Zoning does not really matter. The planning authority can decide how many houses will be granted but it is wrong to grant them all on one side of a town and to allow one developer to have a monopoly. With regard to the tenant purchase scheme, which was parked for a number of years, many people who have paid rent for their houses for 30 or 40 years are not allowed to buy them just because they are on a pension. That is very unfair after they have paid rent for 30 or 40 years. They have the savings but they are not being allowed to buy the houses because they are on social welfare and someone has to be working to qualify for the tenant purchase scheme.	spk_385

It will cost householders an extra €160 for each fill of a 1,000 litre tank. It is recognised that it takes two fills to heat a home for one year, so this is an increase of €320. Ireland's heating oil costs are four times more expensive than in the North of Ireland due to higher levies, taxes and carbon tax. Petrol prices here are up 11% and diesel is up by 14%. The Government has room for manoeuvre in this. We know that the price of a barrel of oil has increased, but in line with this increase the Government's take in taxes, levies and carbon tax has also increased. I ask that the Government forgoes some of that increase in the budget to give poorer people a chance to heat themselves. On top of this the Government is trying to stop people from cutting turf. Does the Government want people to perish with the cold?	spk_126

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-09-19	dail	32	Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2018: Second Stage	dbsect_29	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this very important Bill and also to thank Deputy Clare Daly for her input and her long-standing work on this matter. The coroner services, which are operated by the local authorities, are in many instances the final verification of what happen to a family's loved one and on all occasions it is a very sad time for families. So many families have to endure and wait for this inquest which in some cases takes a very long time. I would ask that going forward these inquests be expedited. If they go on for a long time while families are getting back and starting to live without their loved one, the inquest brings it all back again maybe two or three years later. That is not good enough; inquests should happen a lot sooner. The key provisions of the Bill include clarifying that the purpose of the inquest goes beyond establishing the medical cause of the death and establishing the circumstances in which the death took place. In the case of farm accidents or road accidents, it is very final and very sad to know how the person died medically, but it is very important to determine what caused the accident so that we could eliminate that cause or prevent a case like it ever happening again. Another key provision is strengthening the coroner's powers to summon witnesses to an inquest and to direct a witness to produce documents and evidence and to answer questions. I think that is only fair because, again, families are waiting for the truth and that is very important. In some cases, witnesses may be after travelling from very far away. When the inquest takes place they have to travel a very long distance and maybe they do not have finances. Things like that have to be taken into account and it should be possible to try to help or finance someone who is having a difficulty coming to the inquest. Another key provision is new powers for the coroner acting under a warrant from the District Court to enter and inspect premises and to take copies or possession of documents or material relevant to the inquest. That is very important because otherwise cases and the truth will not be made available. There will be appropriate penalties for witnesses not co-operating with the inquest and I believe that is very important also.  At this juncture, I would like to thank our own coroner in Kerry, Terence Casey, who retired last year after giving more than 20 years' service to south Kerry. He did a wonderful job in tough conditions. It is always tough when we go through the real aspects of what happened. We need good people to be able to withstand what they see. We are also very lucky, in respect of farm accidents and road accidents, that we have Inspector Jim O'Brien, who operates out of Tralee and is doing a tough job brilliantly. He has vast experience and is most helpful. We respect him for his expertise and his honesty and the great work that he is doing. There is greater clarity and transparency in the mandatory reporting of certain types of death including a detailed list of specific examples of mandatory reportable deaths. I hope that suicide is not going to be one of these mandatory reportable deaths. Suicide is such a tragic death when it happens in a family and I do not think the general public needs to know what happened in those instances, that it was suicide. Families are going through enough and are trying to retain their dignity. I think it would be very unfair on these people if it had to come out publicly that their loved one's death was caused by suicide. It will be an offence for a responsible person not to report a mandatory reportable death to the coroner. That is very important. There is to be updating and modernising of the provisions regarding post mortem examinations to take account of forensic developments and current practice. That is very important as well because as technology has improved we need to make provisions for it. Reflecting on the provision of Deputy Clare Daly's Private Members' Bill regarding maternal deaths, I think that is most important and should have been there before but at least we hope it is to be in place going forward. When a couple loses a baby before it is born, in mid-birth or whatever, that should not be public knowledge to anyone beyond the family. It is very tough on a couple who may be trying to have a child and loses it before it comes into the world. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak and I support the Bill.	spk_396

We have a Taoiseach, a Tánaiste, a Minister for Health, three Ministers of State at the Department of Health and a Government, but we have no proper health service for the people of County Kerry.

Indeed, I thank all the Oireachtas Members from all sides and all the people around the country who work and strive to keep Ireland ticking over, from the highest-paid executive to the people on the community employment schemes.They all deserve credit for the great work they do. Of the men and women who get up in the morning, 99% of them do so with the notion of doing well for everyone. Yesterday I assisted into the audiovisual room people from all over the country who wanted to highlight the need for tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, and medicinal cannabis to be made available to them to improve their lot and assist them in counteracting the medical conditions they have. They included Noreen O'Neill from Kilgarvan, whose people's farm is separated from mine by the Roughty river and who has a little boy, Michael, who will be two in August, as well as Rosemary Clough, whose son, Gerard Darlington, is in a wheelchair. I asked him how he was and he told me he was not good. Also there were Deirdre Coughlan and her son Stephen O'Mahony and Caroline O'Sullivan and others. I thank all of the Members and their secretaries who attended the presentation on behalf of men, women and children who asked for the availability of THC and medicinal cannabis to minimise pain and increase their chance to live a normal life. The Minister for Health has stated licences can be granted to allow for prescriptions to be given out but consultants and doctors are reluctant to sign applications to apply for this licence. Only seven have been granted up to now. It is clear that doctors and consultants have a difficulty in applying for the licence because they do not have the backing of the HSE and they are not indemnified by the HSE. They are afraid of liability being attached to them. I ask for the Government to deal with this. We are all going on holidays and Noreen O'Neill is terribly afraid her little boy will not survive. She drives to Bantry for THC and pays €180 for a bottle that lasts for 12 days. She pays for it out of her carer's allowance. Other countries have dealt with this and legalised it. Why are we lagging behind? It has been going on here for a year and a half or almost two years. Some people have it but it is not available and we need it.	spk_152

I agree with him that consultants and doctors have the knowledge but they are prevented from signing the applications because it looks like they are not indemnified by the HSE and that liability will fall to them. Time is not on the side of many of these patients. I am asking the Government to do something, by statutory instrument or whatever, to allow the consultants and doctors to sign the applications. Doctors prescribe medicine. They will not prescribe an item that remains a Schedule 1 banned substance. It needs to be rescheduled to Schedule 4, in order that doctors would be prescribing a designated medicine. The time and effort required to make a single application, let alone a consultant having to apply for multiple patients, is logistically impossible. In the interim, the Government can bring in all the laws and legislation it wants but it should do something and sign some statutory instrument to allow this medicinal cannabis to be obtained. I am not looking for cannabis for any reason other than medicinal purposes to be administrated through our chemists and doctors.	spk_154

We do not know what will happen with Brexit and neither does the Minister of State. We need to be ready and ensure that our ports, including Rosslare, are up to scratch. The customs process must also be ready in order that we can still trade with the UK if it still wishes to trade with us. Likewise, the roads infrastructure leading to our ports needs to be upgraded. I know one road where articulated lorries pass me daily on the way to Castletownbere. The road going from Kenmare to Lauragh is in a desperate state. Going back a number of years, my father got funding for a part of it but the Cork side back to Castletownbere is only fit for two donkeys and cars to pass each other. That is the truth. It is not fair on the lorry drivers trying to negotiate the roads with loads of fish. I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Boxer Moran, who visited us in Kerry this time last year. There is a slip on the road to Fenit and following his visit, the Minister of State allocated €176,116 just to deal with the slip and ensure the road stays open. We thank him very much for that. Liebherr uses the port at Fenit around the clock and if that company is to continue trading with Britain, that port must be improved. All of Kerry depends on Liebherr for employment and if anything happened so it could not export through the port or a delay was caused, it could mean many people would be out of work. The entire economy of Kerry would fall asunder if Liebherr did not have the facility available in order to trade with the UK if it goes outside the European market. It is a consideration that must be taken into account. The roads leading to our ports, such as the road to Fenit, must be upgraded for the massive volumes of traffic using it every day and night. It is how people operate. We welcome the money we got from the slip but the roads must be further upgraded to facilitate the vehicles of today. There is much work to be done and I hope the Minister of State is listening to us. It is serious for the bit of employment we have in Kerry. We are trying to hold on to the employment we have because we do not seem to be able to attract new employment to the county.	spk_341

It should be a full medical card on account of the great work they do. Many are family members who give up their jobs and their time to care for their parents or other relatives who would have no one else to care for them and they get little respite or time for themselves. I agree with Deputy Collins. The home help service is 30 minutes and when family members in Kerry ask for a second home help they cannot get one. It takes two trained people to operate a hoist and some patients are very fat at that stage so it is a total no-no. Many families pay for home help out of their own pockets. There is no home help on Saturdays, Sundays or bank holidays, apart from in very rare cases. Sick and elderly people do not get better for the weekend or a bank holiday. They need the same attention and care for seven days as they get for five days. When carers apply for funding to be a carer they have to wait for 12, 14 or 18 weeks. Live horse and you will get grass, and grass is very scarce at the present time. The wait is too long. Another thing that is happening is the removal of medical cards from elderly people. I do not know who authorised this but they are looking for all sorts of information from people as old as 85 or 86 who have had medical cards since they got to pension age. Will the Minister explain what is happening? Why is there such a shortage of funding and why are we taking medical cards away from these people? Nobody can understand it. Reviews are being done into people's circumstances and I know one man aged 89 who had a medical card but does not have it now. He has gone through the hoops to get it back but he has to pay for his drugs and whatever he needs to take on a weekly basis. It is very unfair on old people who have served the country well and brought it to where it is now.	spk_372

Today, I had contact from a person whose accountant was sick. That person received a fine because the deadline was missed by a few days. The small companies in my neck of the woods are all family-run operations. They have to work all of the hours God gives them to make ends meet. On my way here this morning, I received a call from a fellow trying very hard and just because his accountant was sick and could not do the accounts he has to pay a fine. This man can do everything but he is not good at paperwork and he depends on his accountant to keep things straight. This is what has happened to him. It will be very prohibitive and costly for companies if they have to go to the High Court and employ barristers, and we know what they cost. I appeal to the Minister and I will vote against this part of the Bill because it is not fair on small companies. I do not know who thought up this idea. I do not know whether it is the Government or the officials, but I regret very much this is what they are at because these small companies are the people keeping us in here. They are paying the Bills for the civil servants, the Members and the local authorities, and they help to pay for the services. If we nail these people by insisting they must go to the High Court to extend the deadline it will be a very regrettable day. I am glad I have an opportunity to lodge my complaint against this. There are many things going through the House, but we are going to hurt small companies with this. The District Court is well able to deal with it. The way the thing has gone now, it is totally loaded on the side of the State because there are only so many days to make returns. People do not have a C2 certificate for the year any more. It is now on a two monthly basis. It is a hard struggle for many companies out there. I do not know what line of business the Minister is in besides politics, but I know what small employers are going through because I am one and I know about many others. What happens on top of everything is the people who are working hard are caught by the big contractors for massive sums of money at the end of the jobs. We have asked the Government to do something about this. The big contractors do not care when they are tendering because they know they will not pay the subcontractors at the end of the job but will let them go whistle their ducks and not pay them the last of their money. I know of one company that had €20 million practically written off. It reddened people from Malin Head to Mizen Head and down through the country, including small shopkeepers and operators who needed their money but they left them without it. They are after getting away scot clean. They are out now and they will pay a sum of 5 cent in the euro to all of the creditors who are struggling. One young fellow was left without €600,000, and that is the truth. We are doing nothing to help the people who are affected. We are doing nothing to prevent the larger companies from doing this. They are able to get these jobs because they have such a big turnover. There are only so many of them allowed to tender for the big contracts or any worthwhile contract. One of the bars to being allowed to tender is turnover. These companies have the turnover, which is why they can put in whatever price they like and let the small businesses suffer at the end of the line because they will not get the last of their money. This is happening. It is not happening just in Kerry. It is happening throughout the country. To think we are coming in here this evening and agreeing that these poor contractors or companies, that are trying to put bread on the table and working very hard for their money and not getting it for nothing, should come up to the High Court or go to the High Court in Tralee or Cork to extend their deadline. This is highly unsatisfactory and I ask the Minister to drop it because it will hurt a lot of small businesses and drive them further into the ground.	spk_394

I gave several weeks to discussing the programme for Government and pulled out before I had finished because most of the stuff I was putting into it was being pulled out as fast as we were putting it into it. I did, however, think the Government would do something about insurance. It has the power to do something about the cost of insurance, the cost of claims and all of the racket that is going on, but it is doing nothing about them. There is nothing in the Bill that will help the ordinary young person on the road today or who will try to go on the road tomorrow to get insurance at a reasonable cost. All I can see is that there will be a percentage added to insurance premiums to help insurance companies to go wallop as they have been doing. We all saw clearly after Quinn Insurance went out of business how the cost of insurance went up. Surely the Government can also see that they now have a monopoly. There is no one competing with them; they are all doing the same and offering the same price. Will the Minister of State do something about the business of ten-year-old cars which are perfect in every way, with a low mileage and doing a low mileage, for which the insurance companies will not quote? Will he talk to them and did he talk to them? He will not talk to them because it is clear that if he did, he would get some results. Quotes for older people are being doubled from €400 to €800 or €900. Young fellows who deserve a chance to go on the road for the first time are being quoted €3,500, €5,000 or €6,500. How can they manage to pay that sum? I am talking about people living in rural Ireland who do not have a bus, DART or taxi service or access to any public service. The Government talks about seven or eight bus routes that it has added to Rural Link in County Kerry. For what will that cater? It may be wrong for me to point my finger or direct my venom at the Minister of State, but where is the rest of his gang who were here in numbers last Friday clapping for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross? Where are they tonight? Why are they not all here listening to this debate on the serious matter of insurance for people who do not want to break the law and need insurance to go on the road to get to work, their apprenticeship or college? There is no holding them here tonight, but they will clap for the Minister all right when he ensures more people will have to stay at home, thumb or cycle from vast distances into towns. Business people are being hit by the cost of claims. In England someone who suffers a whiplash injury will receive £7,600. In Ireland, for a very minor injury, someone will receive €19,400 and the figure has been known to go up to €77,000. They must have brass necks or gold necks. It is very unfair to think that is happening here and that the Government has been told about it before, but it has done nothing and will do nothing about it. It is two and a half years since it promised that it would. I thought that in this Bill it was going to sort out verything to do with insurance, but there is nothing in it. The Government is only codding the people. It told lies and I mean that. A few weeks ago it stated the cost of insurance had gone down by 17%.	spk_466

That is happening and has happened in County Kerry. More places will now be designated as flood plains and walls will be built around them to hold the water, rather than clearing out rivers. In the meantime the people living all around the area will not be able to get house insurance. That is what is going on. We had one great event in County Kerry, but it is not going ahead this year. Local communities need these yearly events, whether it be a music festival, a carnival, or whatever else.	spk_468

I raised concerns yesterday evening about the clause inserted in the 2040 plan whereby planning may be granted in rural areas if it does not impact in urban areas. That says it all. It is all about Dublin and the larger urban areas and letting rural areas go to hell. It has already been a very bad day for rural Ireland because of what happened with the Bill put forward by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. That legislation is going to change rural Ireland completely for everyone, whether young or old. The young fellow with an apprenticeship or who is at college will not be able to drive. It is no cause for laughter because it will be very hurtful. It will hurt farmers and the different classes of people in rural Ireland. It will isolate people who will have to stay at home in the future. They will have no outlet now. To return to the Bill before the House, a number of smart fellows have made comments. One of them, an individual by the name of John Moran, has stated that rural Ireland is a burden on the State. I disagree with him in that regard. The people I represent disagree with and resent statements like that. The Government appears to be listening to him, however. Deputy Penrose and I can highlight what is wrong with this, but to what avail? The Government is supported by Fianna Fáil and they are talking about confidence and supply. They are the all the same; they claim to represent different sides and views, but their views are the same except that each party wants more seats than the other. There is no difference whatsoever between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil today.	spk_431

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-07-06	dail	32	Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016: From the Seanad (Resumed)	dbsect_7	The State, as small as it is, has two countries in it. What is inside The Pale or inside the M50 is what is important. The Government fights for them and forgets about the people along the western coast. The farther one goes, the worse it gets. People have no services. If more people got their way, they would not be able to travel the road because the briars would be meeting from both sides. What will happen is we will give all the power to this regulator and to the Minister to supersede county development plans. I have been dealing with planners since I first became a member of the local authority and they have to go by the guidelines that they get from Government and, indeed, Europe. There is nothing in the Bill stating that serial objectors should have to pay a larger fee than the person who has an honest concern about something being built in his or her area. There is nothing in this to compel a serial objector to pay €1,000, or, if I got my way, up to €2,000, where people are deprived of getting planning where it is granted by the local authority. Where a planning application was granted by the local authority in a recent case, a serial objector came along and appealed it to An Bord Pleanála, and An Bord Pleanála refused permissions. An Bord Pleanála deemed that the planning applicant, because he was living a little over 6 km from his place of work, did not need to live in that area. The applicant was getting the site from his uncle and it was a big start to him to build a house for himself and to put a roof over the heads of himself, his wife and his family. He will not have that chance now because An Bord Pleanála got from somewhere that 6 km was too far away. Where will the Government provide employment for such people? Will it bring them all into towns and cities and not allow people live in the countryside where, as Deputy Penrose said, they could look after their elderly parents and save on the cost of home help or home care or putting them into nursing homes? Is that what the Government wants to do? It is all so ridiculous what the Government is at. Likewise, the grandparents could look after the children while the parents were out working. The Government wants to tear the family fabric asunder. I am putting down a marker. I am against what the Government is doing. The Government wants to give the Minister or the regulator power or an open book, and the Minister of State did not even know who would appoint the regulator last night. The regulator will be appointed and he will supersede county development plans while the local authority members slave hard to represent local people on the ground and help them get planning permission or the services that they are entitled to every bit as much as the people in Dublin. The Government wants to supersede the county development plan into which members and management of local authorities put so much work. I deplore what the Government is at. It is scandalous. As Deputy Penrose stated, this will have an impact. There will be no planning permission granted in rural areas even though the applications comply with the criteria. They provide their own sceptic tanks to a high standard. They provide and pay for their own water and they kick up no racket about it. The sad truth of it is that in their taxes and in many other ways they will pay for people in Dublin to have free water. I reject and resent what the Government is at but we cannot stop it because the Government has the support of Fianna Fáil in this instance. They state it is confidence and supply but it is a coalition to keep Fine Gael in power. Until the next election, we can do nothing. However, we will try our very best to ensure that we change it because the Government does not deserve to be allowed continue what it is doing to the people of rural Ireland. The Government's thoughts or considerations are not with them at all.	spk_440

I am very doubtful that it has the money. In 2015 we were told that €62.5 million was to be given to build social housing in County Kerry. That is well over three years ago and I can guarantee that €62.5 million has not landed in County Kerry. A total of 20 houses have been built in Killarney. That is the number that have been built so far and a few more have been started. A few houses have also been bought here and there. The Taoiseach did not know what a demountable home was. There are several families in County Kerry still living in such homes. One couple has been living in such a home for 22 years and they are now looking for a new one. There is a blockage for the local authority which has been caused by the Department.No demountable home can be brought to anyone unless his or her current place of occupation has been burned or flooded and it is not to be lived in permanently. Not being able to use a demountable home in that way is clearly a blockage. I know of several farmers who are living on their own or with their wives, but the couple I mentioned raised their only daughter in a demountable home and she comes back to them every weekend. They have no other place in which to live. They want to live on their own land. The situation is the same in the case of rural cottages. If the Government has money to give to local authorities, why is it the case that only ten rural cottages will be built in County Kerry in the period between 2016 and 2021? There are a further 37 households on the waiting list for a rural cottage to be built on their own land. They have the site, which is the main element, but the local authority is only receiving enough funding to build ten cottages. These are the facts. If the Government had the money, I am sure it would allow the local authority to build 47 houses, instead of just ten, but that is not happening. Under Project Ireland 2040, people who just want planning permission to build their own house are being denied it. A family received planning permission from Kerry County Council to build a house, but a serial objector appealed the decision to An Bord Pleanála on a number of points. Planning permission was refused by it on the grounds that the person concerned was living too far away from his place of work. That is the whole truth, your honour, and nothing but the truth. A distance of 6 km was considered by An Bord Pleanála to be too far from his workplace.	spk_346

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-07-05	dail	32	Home Building Finance Ireland Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_46	"Perhaps that is what is wrong, but I will tell the truth wherever I am, be it here, there or anywhere. One will always win out with the truth. I am sceptical about the €20 million figure, but the Government could take simple actions. For example, it could help small builders by reducing the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9%, which would achieve a great deal. Other blockages are preventing small builders from building houses. If a house costs €200,000, the Government will receive more than €40,000 in VAT and levies. With the purchaser of the house paying 3.5%, the Government will receive up to €55,000 in taxes, bringing the total to more than one quarter of the overall amount. Developers were classed together in a bundle as a bad lot, but that was not true. Of course, there were a few rotten apples, but, by and large, most builders, especially the smaller ones, always served the country well. A few years ago there were four staged payments. A builder was paid when he or she brought a house to floor level, to wall plate level, to roof level and on completion. In that way, builders were able to finance their activities and the Government would not need this €20 million which is ""expected to be provided"". The Government could do something about the issue. We all accept that some houses were not built to a proper standard, but local authorities now have building control units and houses must be built to the standard set and in accordance with planning permission. The Government could take that route, instead of pursuing yet another idea that will not work. By the time the small developer or builder accesses the money, he or she will have been put through so many hoops that there will be a bush in the gap and the people waiting on the house will be very cold if they do not have somewhere else to stay. We saw what happened with the repair and lease scheme. It was only made available where there was a large demand for social housing. It did not help anyone in a small rural village or where it was deemed there was insufficient demand for housing. Some people are able to do up and rent out their houses and none of them is left idle. If the Government had made the repair and lease scheme available in rural areas, it would have worked, but it was never intended for them because what I am smelling is that the Government does not have the money. If it told us straight that it did not have the money, every Deputy would accept it, but putting bundles of paper in front of us again and telling us that it is expected that 6,000 homes will be built offers no surety to those who are waiting for a home. If a couple and two children who want to get on the social housing list have an income of more than €33,000, they will be prevented from doing so, but if they are to obtain a loan from the same local authority, they must have an income in excess of €50,000. As such, a group of people are not being catered for and I am not convinced that, regardless of who dreamed it up, the Bill will help them. As I have often said in the Chamber, I do not believe the Government has the money. We would be grateful if it just told us this. Everyone would accept it and we would make do with what we had. In 2015 we were told in County Kerry that we would receive a sum of €62.5 million. We will probably only receive it by 2035 or thereabouts. The Government's members are master architects of spin and not dealing in reality.I have learned here in recent years that any of these ideas the Government comes up with are just ideas and they are not working for many people. The sad fact is that in the 2040 plan, the Government says that people will still be allowed to build one-off houses in rural areas if it does not detract from urban areas. We want honest answers about what that means. What has the Government told the local authorities? Is it telling the local authorities that people must buy much more expensive houses in urban areas where development land is much more expensive and that they cannot build on their own sites that they may be getting from their fathers or uncles? That was always allowed. Is the Government going to change that entirely? At the same time, it does not have the wherewithal to build social houses. I know first-hand that in Kerry, only ten rural cottages can be built between now and 2021 when there are 37 more waiting. They are being told that they will have to continue to wait. I hope that what the Minister of State says will work out but I am sceptical about it in light of what has happened or, more correctly, what has not happened in the past two and a half years."	spk_358
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-07-05	dail	32	Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016: From the Seanad	dbsect_48	Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice has asked for clarity on what the Government means in its 2040 plan. The plan says that one-off housing may still be built if it does not detract from urban centres. People need clarity on this. As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, the interpretation is that if so many houses are to be built in a county then urban areas may use the bulk of the allocation. Where will this leave people with their own sites in rural areas? Where will it leave rural Ireland? It would be devastated worse than it is currently. This has already manifested itself in Kerry. A couple was granted planning permission by Kerry County Council. Lo and behold, one of the serial objectors who has caused mayhem right around the country appealed the decision to An Bord Pleanála. After due time the planning permission was turned down on the grounds that the applicants lived too far from their place of work, which was 6 km away. Members are aware that farming for many today is part-time and people have to travel some 20, 40 or 50 miles to teaching jobs and to different kinds of work. This is the nature of employment. One has to travel to go to work today. I hope the policy will not deny people who get some or a greater part of their income in one area from living in the rural area where they were brought up. This is the fabric of their lives - where their parents are and on their own farms. They may want to be near their parents to see after them in their twilight years. Grandparents often have a great input with grandchildren. They could be the minders of the grandchildren while the parents are trying to secure an income to supplement or maintain the household as a viable unit. I hope the Government is not going to try to change this. The word is that this is what the Government is trying to do with this plan. What direction has the Government or the Department given to the local authorities? Will this planning regulator supersede our county development plans, which our local authority members have worked so hard on to put together? They put a great amount of effort into those plans over the years and the decades. The elected local authority members' views were adhered to in the subsequent county development plans. Will the new planning regulator have a superior role to or supersede the county manager? Time will tell, but Ireland has not had a good result from regulators up to now. The energy regulator has ensured the gas project in north Kerry has remained at standstill for many years.	spk_383

We accept that national primary roads are a no-no, but five families along the national secondary road from Killarney to Barraduff were stopped from building houses for themselves on sites with existing entrances all because of a document signed by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2012.

As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, we will be fobbed off when it comes to the Minister and the regulator. The Minister must ask the regulator and the regulator must ask the Minister. I am very concerned about that. Regarding An Bord Pleanála dealing with developments of more than 100 houses, I am open to correction on this but my understanding is that the land does not have to be zoned. We will have to call a vote on this because it is too serious an issue and I can see what will happen down the line.When I was a county councillor on the southern health forum asking questions of the HSE, it would give answers to the effect that it would have to ask the Minister for Health for information. When I came up here and asked the Minister for Health, he stated that he had to ask the HSE. I do not know. When we have a possibility of county development plans being interfered with, changed or being the subject of other directions, it is very serious. The original intention of the Bill was just to appoint a regulator but now we are changing and adding in an awful lot of addendums that could affect local authorities and people in a very hurtful way.

The Members around me in the House have no briars prohibiting them from getting to their doors. I have no personal gripe with them but I have listened to enough rubbish now and I am taking no more of it. This Bill is about allowing people to go safely on narrow roads to their door and allowing their children and old people to walk and cycle without their eyes being taken out. All we are doing here is extending hedge cutting to allow people to cut in the month of August. If I had my way, the roadside hedges would be cut all the year round, full stop. We are entitled to that. Those supporting these amendments have the Luas, trains, buses, taxis and everything else and they do not give one damn. They are taken to their door and they do not have to operate a car, pay tax or insurance or pay for anything else, but they want to stop the people in rural Ireland from having a safe passage to their door. I regret it but that is what they are trying to do. Countrywide, I have nothing at all against birds or bees or any other thing-----	spk_451
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-07-04	dail	32	Heritage Bill  2016: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage	dbsect_35	"They were addressing me when they were looking this way. I can look around too, Acting Chairman, and I am entitled to do that. I will tell you one thing, Acting Chairman. I have no gripe with birds, bees or any other thing like that, and I would love to hear the curlew singing. However, they have the countryside besides the roadside - they have all the rest of the country. We are not saying when the hedges should be cut in the rest of the country. In addition, we are asking that farmers be allowed to burn their scrubland because they are being fined by Europe if they do not have their ground clean. In that type of ground, if anyone in the House does not know it, people cannot operate a lawn-mower, a mowing machine or a forage harvester. The only way they can clean these places is by what I would call controlled burning. Farmers are being blamed for burning and gorse fires. I want to mention two sad stories from places where people did not get their payments for their Christmas dinner, in Tuosist to the west of Kenmare and in Awnaskirtaun near Rathmore. The people involved did not set the fires or put the fires there. They reported them to the fire brigade and gave every help they could to stop the fires but they are still without most of their payments, which is not right. All they are asking for is to be allowed to burn their ground for the month of March. It is allowed in the North of Ireland, which is the same country, until 15 April. What is so different about us here? It is ridiculous. I heard Deputy Burton say there is something wrong with the way farmers are producing meat and that people are moving away from meat. Farmers were never more regulated and they produce their products to the highest standard. They have done everything they can to help the environment by building slatted tanks and slatted sheds, they are holding effluent and doing everything that is required and requested of them. They are doing their level best and it is very wrong to blame the farmer. What I will fight for is the people of rural Ireland, who are entitled to a safe road to their door. There are deaths on our roads and I would like to eliminate as many of them as possible. We had the death of poor Denise Crowley before Christmas last year. We asked for a simple thing, to change the speed limit signs in Glenflesk village. Down the road at Rusheenbeg, where five people had been killed one after the other, we asked for a safety barrier but we did not get it and we have not got it yet, although several other elected representatives have asked for it besides me. What we are asking for now, and it has been asked for in our local authority for the last ten years or more, is that the roadside hedges are cut so people can come and go safely. If people were interested in ground nesting birds, there are other things we could do. We could talk about vermin, mink, foxes, magpies, grey crows, badgers and rats. They are hurting the nests way more than what it is suggested this Bill will do in regard to cutting roadside hedges. That is a fact. They should go after them but they will not do that at all. They will only go after the poor people in rural Ireland and ensure their roads are made narrower, with trees falling down on them. We cannot touch a tree, a bush or a briar. They say: ""Let them suffer on, let them manage any way they can, and do not allow the roadside hedges to be cut."" I am very critical of the Government for certain things it is not doing and will remain so. However, I support it 100% in what it is doing in the Bill. If I had my way, and I had an amendment down on this, I would ask that the hedges be cut all year round, but we will take this much for now because the people really need it to make the roads safe. Our roads are narrow whereas there is no problem up here. Here, they have motorways, with three lanes going down one side and three or maybe four coming up the other side, and the sides of those roads are being cut all year round - they are cut the whole time. Why make fish of one and something else of the other? It is just not fair. I have no personal gripe about this but it will hurt rural Ireland if it is not addressed. I appeal to those putting forward the amendments to give over because it will create a divide eventually if they try to stop these roadside hedges being cut and stop burning for the month of March. These are minimal requirements and we would not fight so hard for them except people out there are waiting for this.I ask the Minister to progress the legislation as quickly as possible given the huge number of people who are asking for it. Their roads are in a shocking state."	spk_453

When the weather is wet or rainy, the scientists are blaming what we are doing on this earth for causing it to rain. Likewise they are blaming people now for the fine weather as well. The facts are that since 1850, since what was known as the little ice age, the temperatures have risen by less than one degree.

Cross compliance means farmers are not allowed to touch a river.They will lose their headage payments, which means they will lose the bread from their tables. This is what is causing the rivers to be choked. None of them has been touched for the past 20 years.	spk_201

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-07-03	dail	32	Urban Regeneration and Housing (Amendment) Bill 2018: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_34	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this matter this evening. I believe that most people who get up in the morning want to do right and they mean well but I have concerns about putting compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, on land or taking land off people. I am worried about that because if land was handed down or had to be bought at a high price, it may not be fair to take it off people if the balance is not right as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said. Developers may not be able to get finance, there may be right of way issues, there could be several things, there could be title issues or there could be many reasons so that is why I would not put my name to a CPO directive to take land off people and hand it on to anyone. There was mention this evening of 200,000 houses being vacant around the country. That could be right but they are not in the right places. There are houses vacant in different rural, isolated places where families will not or cannot go as there is no public transport, facilities or services. Mention was also made of the repair and lease scheme. The reason that scheme is not successful is that there was not enough money given to it and because the local authorities could only operate the repair and lease scheme where there was a need for social housing or where there was pressure on. As far as Kerry was concerned that was Tralee, Killarney and Dingle. The repair and lease scheme did not apply to all of the rest of the county. The Government is saying it has so many plans and reports about what it will do and what will be done but I believe that the finance is not there. Why does the Government not come out straight and say it because in Kerry there are 37 people now who have applications in for rural cottages. They have the sites themselves. They will not be considered until 2021, so if people who have the sites and the need cannot get their houses built because the Department will not give the green light to the local authority, that signals that the money is not there. It is the same with the way demountable homes are being blocked by the Government. The Taoiseach did not even know what they were but I can tell the Minister of State that I know what they are and the people who are inside them and living in them at present in Kerry want them to be upgraded but they will not get that. The only people who will get a demountable home now are those whose house gets flooded or goes on fire. Those are the reasons that have been given by the Department. That rules out demountable homes altogether and that says to me that the Government just does not have the funding. To get back to this Bill which proposes to take property off people. These are human beings as well and most of these people mean well. We have to look at it seriously. We should let the Bill progress and let it be evaluated in the other forums but I have a concern, as I always had, about putting a CPO on property belonging to someone else because it is not the right way to do it.	spk_471
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-07-03	dail	32	Heritage Bill 2016: Report Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_36	I welcome the Bill and the extension of hedge-cutting time to include the month of August and burning time to include the month of March. Farmers in Northern Ireland are allowed burn until 15 April and, as there is only a ditch between the North and the South, it does not make much sense for farmers here to have to cease by the end of February. Many Februarys have been wet and farmers could not burn. Burning is necessary because land becomes overgrown and useless and cannot be grazed by sheep or cattle. There is great merit in extending burning time to include February or March because there might be a dry spell in the middle of February and one would be able to burn the land one wishes to burn. We should go back to farmers' former practice of controlled burning. At that time, Coillte helped farmers. A farmer would notify Coillte that he or she wished to burn and it would assist the farmer to ensure that the fire did not spread to forestry or other land. That can be done methodically and carefully by opening a fire vent such that the fire does not travel. All farmers whose land is prone to burning or whose fire may spread to other land should open fire vents, which is not very expensive. It could improve matters greatly if controlled burning was carried out and we should be aiming for that. Under the Bill, the cutting of roadside hedges will be allowed in August, which I very much welcome even though I have always maintained that the cutting of roadside hedges should be permitted all year round for the safety of all road users. We are told that it is good for our health to walk but those doing so on country roads are in danger. Some roads are so dangerous that one's eyes might be picked out if one tried to stay close to a hedge on a narrow road in order to avoid being knocked down. Cyclists could be knocked off their bicycles by briars, etc. It is imperative that roadside hedges are cut and that roads are safe for people to walk, cycle and drive on. Many people regularly complain to me about hedges which need to be cut. They have difficulty passing cars on narrow roads. A new car costs money and one should not have to run the risk of one's property being scratched or damaged by hedging. I also receive regular requests for hedges or branches to be cut in order to allow school buses pick up children on country roads. That is one of the main issues with which local representatives deal. It is important for the safety of children that a branch or briar does not break the windscreen or side window of a school bus and injure a child travelling on it. Farmers regularly complain that they cannot get goods or milk lorries up or down the roads to their farms. Wing mirrors, which may cost €1,000, are often broken. Parts of the Ring of Kerry are still unsafe for tour buses. The road is only the width of one bus and buses cannot pass a car where hedges or briars extend into the road. It is ridiculous that people are stating that the Bill, if implemented, will lead to nesting birds being harmed. As I put it to Kerry County Council, what bird would be so foolish as to make a nest on the side of the road where the wind from a lorry could blow the feathers off the bird and leave it standing naked in the middle of the road? It does not make any sense. I do not request permission to cut the field side of hedges but the side facing the road should be cut, and continually so, for the safety of all road users. The next thing will be for someone to say that part of the road should be given over to wildlife as well as the side of the road. The side of the road is part of the road network and should be treated as such. Local authorities have previously refused to cut roadside hedges because of a law passed by the Oireachtas in approximately 1993, as a result of which the local authorities believe the cutting of hedges is none of their business. However, if one were to take certain actions beyond the ditch forming the border between one's land and the road, the local authority would not be long in putting a stop to it. The roadside is part of the local and national road network and should be treated as such. Another Bill progressing through the House will require motorists to give cyclists 1.5 m passing space. However, if a cyclist is keeping out from briars, he or she will be closer to the centre of the road, which would mean there may be no space for a motorist to pass on a narrow road, particularly with, for example, a car and possibly a bicycle coming in the opposite direction. I support the Bill, which is designed to ensure that roadside hedges are cut in the month of August and that farmers be allowed to burn in the month of March.	spk_494

I do not know how or where that interpretation came from because it seems that everything is still up in the air. I believe the discussions should be between Ireland and England and between Europe and England to ensure we do not have a hard border. It will hurt farming, especially in rural areas, and it will hurt small businesses exporting to the UK and to the North of Ireland. The Government needs to put pressure on Prime Minister May to come clean and to make a decision sooner rather than later. All this is not helping our cause. Britain needs to be cornered - that is the word - and made to come clean as to what it is going to do. The Taoiseach is now saying that he will fight and more or less put it up to Prime Minister May. I hope he will. I believe, however, that the Government should also be trying to encourage the British Government, and indeed the Labour Party, and have talks to see if there is any way another referendum could be devised that would give people in Britain a chance to vote again. Many of them voted the last time purely against the establishment and are sorry now about the outcome of the referendum. I met my own cousins and I asked them about this. They said they had all voted to get out of the EU but if they got one half of a chance, they would not even have to be asked much, they would all vote to stay. We hear people like that, that we know, and are perhaps surprised at their vote in the first place to get out. That is what I am asking because it is hard to see how we will not have a hard border and how that can be devised. People need to be told how that will be arrived at. The Government now needs to pull out all of the stops and do its best for this country because we are depending on it and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee. We appreciate what is being done but pressure needs to be kept on to ensure we get what is best for Ireland.	spk_290

We should do what is wanted by the people out the country being affected by thieves, blackguards and criminals. When dealing with serial offenders, we should give them no bail or legal aid. The first day they are caught they should go before a judge and be jailed right away. Waste no more time or money with them as that is the way they should be dealt with. This applies especially to those people convicted before courts for other crimes. They should not be treated the same as the poor person with a single misdemeanour who is entitled to bail or free legal aid. In cases of serial offenders, like in America, the day after being caught they should be brought before the judge and jailed right away. They should get no other chance as that is what they deserve. They do not appreciate what is right and wrong and they should be made to understand it. Garda stations have been closed in rural Ireland and I call on the Minister to reopen them, particularly as they had a positive effect in the past. They were there since the foundation of the State. In good times and bad, we kept them open. The Government is boasting that the country has been turned around and things are flying again.

If he or she blots his or her copybook, I would accept it, but they are not being given a chance. The Minister does not understand what it is like to live in a remote place. If he was asked to live in a place like Glenmore, Lauragh or the Black Valley for three or four weeks and did not have a car, he would understand how hard it was and what it was like to try to manage in such places. Gardaí have enough to do as it is without having to monitor this new law. There are drugs to be monitored, with thieves and robbers, as well as anti-social behaviour. Does the Minister know that if he succeeds in pushing or ramming this Bill through, it will hurt many elderly people who took up driving when their partners died? I refer to those who had to start to learn to drive and took the 12 lessons. It could be a woman in her 60s who took 12 driving lessons. They are perfectly good drivers and can drive well in rural places, from Kenmare to Lauragh, Sneem to Caherdaniel and Gneeveguilla to Rathmore. However, when they have to go into a city to take the driving test, they lose confidence and start to shake and shiver. Many of them are finding it very hard to pass the test. Does the Minister realise he is going to hurt this group of people? I was in a supermarket in Killarney very early last Sunday morning. A girl who has been working there for a few months asked me when the Minister's Bill would be passed, or whether it had already been passed. I said it had not yet been passed.

Why do we not have enough testers? Is there trouble with the unions? Are we being held over a barrel such that we cannot employ more testers? Surely there are people who are qualified and who could do the testing? Why can we not hire them? It is not fair to be holding up these people in this way. Reference was made to the Local Link. The Minister announced eight routes in Kerry. One of them was agreed before the Minister ever dreamt up the idea. Route number 3 runs from Castlegregory to Cloghane. A car came on Tuesdays once a month for ten months. How is that going to help people who cannot get from A to B? Will the Minister expand the rural Local Link so that we can help young drivers who are waiting for their tests? That is an issue that I support and want addressed as well. We barely have enough school buses to take the children to school. Routes are being cut. Where fewer than ten children travel, the route is squashed. It is simply a way of getting out and saving money. Where is the Minister getting the money? Is it from the Leprechaun? Bus Éireann does not seem to have the money for the school run.Where will this money come from? It is not too late for him to do more assessments of what he is doing. I ask him to return to his plan and to live in a rural place in Kerry for at least a week without a car to see how he would manage. He might have his thumb up on the road with nothing passing.

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-06-26	dail	32	Special Needs Assistants: Motion	dbsect_35	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important motion. We must all recognise that the special needs assistant scheme is vital in ensuring the integration of children with special needs into mainstream education and the positive role SNAs play in the development of children in schools. They must be thanked for the great work they do and the way that they bring children forward. They play a key role in supporting children who have additional care needs to attend school and participate in education. It is difficult to get onto the SNA supplementary assignment panel as an SNA is required to have a minimum of one year's service. However, service in a substitute capacity, that is, covering maternity or sick leave, career breaks or job sharing does not count. Parents have to fight and are rightfully very anxious that their child gets the necessary special training to bring their child to the same level as the other children. It is clear that children who have the greatest need require intervention from a very early age. Most improve greatly as a result. Sadly, some may not especially those who are not assisted in time. Sometimes these children reach adulthood and become physically very strong and become a worry to their parents. Often they present with mental health issues and sometimes can even be a threat to their parents. In Kerry there are few supports, if any, for these children or grown-up adults. Parents have no respite or assistance. I know one poor mother who must lock her door every night because she is afraid of her son. One mother in north Kerry lost her life after her son killed her. Each year, principals and boards of management spend significant time making applications for SNA supports in their schools. We call on the Government to provide job security for SNAs by providing permanent contracts. One SNA who was in a position for over 12 years has been made redundant twice in the last three years. That is not good enough.It has to be recognised that SNAs carry out several different duties in the schools including toileting, facilitating students' mobility, escorting students around the school, feeding and dressing. It is an intense job, mentally and physically. One is on the go for all the hours one is in the school. I ask the Minister to give us the support we are looking for in this motion.	spk_429

I ask the Taoiseach to forgo that massive revenue take increase and give some of it back to the poor people. Hauliers, ordinary people who drive to work and farmers are being driven into the ground with this additional cost burden. Surely, the Government can forgo some of this revenue and reduce the cost of petrol and diesel on behalf of all the people who have been affected by these massive price increases.	spk_196

They cannot sleep as they are worried about when consultants will see them and they are waiting for treatment. Elderly people are waiting for hips and knees and every other type of operation. The most serious thing at present is that people are waiting in our cardiac unit, a unit that does massive work for many people in Kerry, Cork and the south of Ireland. In CUH there are people waiting as we are speaking. We have five Ministers for Health, a Government and a Department of Health but we do not have a health system. That is the truth of the matter. One man I know very well was to have a planned triple bypass. It was arranged for sometime at the start of April. The day he was to go in, it was cancelled and then he was waiting for three or four weeks. The next thing that happened was he got the heart attack and he was admitted to the hospital and he was there for three weeks. He was promised day after day that he would be done the next day and he was only done in the last week. That is not good enough. I have raised this point at different times on the Order of Business. It is happening again. There are several patients there at present in the same capacity, waiting for a triple bypass. What is wrong? The Government needs to put more resources and more surgeons in there. The work needs to be done. These people do not have time. They will get a heart attack and die and that will be the end of them. The other thing is intermediary care vehicles. It is a nonsense - a joke. The Government did this thing called ""reconfiguration of the ambulance service"" in Kerry and emergency ambulances were cut way down. That is the result of it. An 85 year old man was to be taken from Tralee to Cork and because the emergency ambulance could not or would not take him, he remained on a trolley for two whole days. That is not good enough. That is not the way to treat our elderly who have served our country and brought us to where we are. I am told there is a way better health service in Cuba where there is a dictatorship. That is the truth. In spite of having five Ministers for Health, a Government and a health service, we cannot serve the people."	spk_327

That goes against the grain of humane behaviour. I would not condone it and I deplore it. We are depending on the same Government led by President Trump to be lenient with Irish immigrants to the US who have played a major part in building America since the 1700s when many of our forefathers went there on the coffin ships in the hope that they would survive. Many of them lived and they played a great part in building that great country, the United States. We all have relatives there today. We appeal to President Trump to be lenient with illegal immigrants from Ireland who continue to work there. We hope they will be provided with some mechanism to allow them to come home for weddings and funerals, as it breaks their hearts when they miss such events. They cannot come back here, because if they did, they could not go back to their jobs again. We hope President Trump will do something for them. There has been much bashing of President Trump since his election, although many people voted for him. He has played a vital role in neutralising Korea. A few of our Ministers wanted to go there to sort it out but perhaps they will stay at home and do something here instead. It appears that President Trump has alleviated that threat to world peace. We must give him a chance in that regard. We appeal to him not to separate children from their parents.	spk_358
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-06-20	dail	32	Summer Economic Statement 2018: Statements	dbsect_34	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this very important debate and will begin by speaking about health. We have five Ministers and Ministers of State in the Department of Health and we have a Government but we do not have a health service that is fair to sick and vulnerable people who need care. As was mentioned already, mental health services and treatment for people with depression and other mental health problems are practically non-existent in Kerry. If such people are unwell on a Friday evening, all they can do is ring SouthDoc or go to the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Kerry, which is already overcrowded. Proper assistance is not being given to people who present with mental health problems and so many are committing suicide. It is such a shame because a life is a life and these people are not getting the attention they deserve. What the Government is proposing with regard to congregated settings is not right because one size does not fit all. We have been asking that the policy in that regard be reviewed and an assessment be done on those who have been moved out from congregated settings to see how they are doing. We have asked for a report on that but nothing has been forthcoming. On housing, I have said many times that if the Government does not have the money it claims to have it should just come out and say so. I believe that the Government does not have the funding it claims to have for housing. Ten rural cottages will be built in Kerry between 2016 and 2021. People are providing their own sites but there are 37 more people looking for rural cottages. Why does the Government not just give them the money? The Government said three years ago that it was giving €62.5 million to Kerry for housing but that money has not been spent. IBEC has said, with regard to roads and infrastructure, that Ireland has the lowest amount of capital projects in Europe. I know of one project that must be progressed but which only received €25,000 this year, namely the Killarney bypass. The town is choked with traffic.Approximately 18,600 people travel on the existing bypass every day, which is not fit for purpose. The Government is talking about the climate change effort. It is going to spend money. It is going to tax farmers and people on the road with more carbon tax, even though they are paying enough for petrol and diesel at the pumps at present. It is blaming people who cut turf for climate change. The rumour now is that the Government is going to sacrifice farmers and get them to reduce cow numbers, even though we know they are only barely existing and have to increase their numbers to survive economically and stay on their farms. We cannot believe what the Government is coming back with from Europe to deal with the challenges of Brexit. Before Christmas, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste said they had it all sorted and there was going to be a soft border. Now we do not know. There are different viewpoints from across the water every day. I hope the Government asks the UK to have another referendum. That is what should happen. I was the first person to ask for that when the UK decided in the initial referendum to leave the EU. Project 2040 does not give much hope to County Kerry. It is hardly mentioned in the plan at all. The only way in which it will have an effect is that people looking to build one-off houses for themselves will be told they can get planning permission if it does not detract from an urban town or city. On education, we had a group representing students here today and its members stated that college students are having fierce difficulty sourcing accommodation. They asked for purpose-built accommodation to be provided for students in the cities where colleges are based. Primary schools are under fierce pressure to continue. It is not right that parents and teachers have to raise funds to keep schools going. It is no different from what happened years ago when each child had to bring a sod of turf to school to keep the fire going.	spk_421

They attend accidents on our roads and many times they encounter horrendous situations, including in our cities and on our motorways, where lives are lost. The DFB does excellent work. Why we do not leave them alone to continue doing so? When I hear the words ""reconfiguration of services"", I know that means a reduction in services. We have found that to be the case in Kerry, whereby a so-called reconfiguration of the ambulance service was simply a reduction. In many instances now, it can be an hour or more before an ambulance arrives in parts of Kerry because the service is stretched to the limit. A Tralee-based ambulance that comes out of Cork University Hospital has to press a button to report availability for work and can end up in Kinsale or Kanturk rather than back in Tralee. When that happens, Kerry is left without an ambulance. I thank the ambulance workers for the great work they are doing. I also thank the members of the fire service in Kerry in places like Sneem, Kenmare, Killarney, Tralee and Listowel. They do great work protecting people when fires break out. I saw them at work on the night a local pub was burned down and they did everything they could to save as much property as possible. They do everything really. They do their level best and while they might not really put their lives in danger, they have a tough time. When they are called out, they have to get on the road within minutes. Everything depends on them doing that. We depend on them so much.  I ask the Government to leave Dublin Fire Brigade alone and let it continue to do the work it has been doing for the past 50 or 60 years."	spk_396

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-06-13	dail	32	Housing: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_33	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on housing again in the Chamber. I raised the matter of rural cottages and demountable homes with the Taoiseach over a week ago and the man had not a clue what I was talking about. I do not blame him. He is from Dublin and does not know what is happening or is needed in rural Ireland.  Rural cottages have been a way of life in rural Ireland for years, longer than I can remember, since the 1960s. The person provided the site to the local authority, which built the house for them where they could farm their own land. When they got on their feet, they bought the house back from the local authority.  Between 2016 and 2021, ten rural cottages will be built in County Kerry. There are more than 37 applications but the applicants are being told that they are too far away, it will take too long and the local authority may get them a house in town. These people are providing the site and if the Government has the money and cannot build these rural cottages, I do not know what is wrong with it. If it does not have the money it should tell us because we hear the stories of homelessness in urban areas such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other places. Maybe the Government does not have the money but it should tell us if it does not. People will understand that. Ten rural cottages in Kerry is not enough in five years between 2016 and 2021.  Then there are demountable homes. The Taoiseach did not know about these homes, which are vital in rural areas. A mobile home is brought in and the person is able to stay on the land where he or she was born, bred and reared. A circular was sent out to the local authorities saying that a demountable home could only be provided if a person's existing home was burned down or flooded. The Minister has to get a hold of this. I am taking up the time of someone else but this is very wrong and the Minister of State will have to look into it.	spk_330

In recent times, there has been a high level of serious crime and large quantities of drugs have been found.Murders are being committed throughout the country almost on a daily basis. The villains who are perpetrating these atrocities will have to be dealt with, whether in the Special Criminal Court or another court. They have to be taken out of circulation as soon as possible.  In terms of membership of an unlawful organisation, if a superintendent or a chief superintendent believes, based on the information available, that someone should be locked up immediately, I do not see anything wrong with that. What is happening is ridiculous. Drugs and drug lords are causing mayhem in every part of the country. I have said here previously that the Garda needs many more resources to deal with the drugs problem. Drugs are so available now it is like going into a sweet shop; one can get them anywhere. How is that happening? The Minister should use the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act to ensure those people are locked up as soon as they are found guilty of carrying out these serious acts. To go back to the time of the Troubles, we are all glad that the Good Friday Agreement saw an end to those but the country is facing a new challenge, which is dealing with the drugs issue and the drug lords. I ask the Minister to ensure that this Act is used in whatever way he can use it to deal with these villains who are causing mayhem throughout the country.	spk_376

The Taoiseach said in the programme for Government that he would open six new Garda stations. I am calling for him to open the ones that were closed full time. They are open in name, but they are not open for 24 hours a day. Along the coastline from Kenmare to Cahersiveen to Killorglin, Garda numbers are way down.

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-05-29	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Demountable homes have been vital where an old house fell into disrepair or became uninhabitable for those aged 50 and 60 and above and who, in no circumstance, would or could leave their own place. They want to stay in the places they were born and reared. All these people would provide a site for a demountable home. Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae said at last Monday's meeting of Kerry County Council that these people will only leave their home places in a hearse. That is a fact. These units have always provided comfort, a bit of heat, security, and safety from the elements and vermin and they still can. As to rural cottages, only three have been built in Kerry in the last nine years. From 2016 to 2021, ten are to be built. However, there are 35 to 40 more people on the waiting list for these rural cottages. These people will provide a site of their own. They want to live near their parents and their family and to work on their farms but the Department has agreed to fund only ten of these up to 2021. Do we have any funding for housing? If the Government does not, I ask the Taoiseach to spell that out. We would all understand.Clearly, these people are providing almost half the cost of housing themselves. They are providing the site. In 2015, the Government announced €62.5 million for housing in Kerry. It never told us when it would be spent by. Will it last until 2030? Rural cottages have been an integral part of rural Ireland since the foundation of the State, but in particular since the 1960s. Is this aligned with the famous Project Ireland 2040 where planning permission will only be granted in rural areas if the development does not detract from the greater urban areas? For instance, Kerry County Council granted permission to a person to build a house on his own place, being a favoured nephew, and it was appealed to An Bord Pleanála by one of these serial objectors. An Bord Pleanála came back and said that, at 6 km, where he was proposing to build his house was too far away to go to his place of work. That is a fact. These rural cottages almost always end up costing tenants, as they have almost always bought them because they are on their own land and they do not like to see anyone else coming into their own land. It is only a loan, as the houses have been built to standard, and when the tenants have got on their feet, they have bought them out. Is the Government trying to move all the people into Dublin or into the urban areas? That is what I am asking.	spk_17
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-05-29	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	It is clear the Taoiseach has no understanding of what I am talking about. At last Monday's meeting, Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae got a reply that the local authority must clearly demonstrate that the proposed demountable unit is required on foot of a genuine emergency - either a fire or a flood. I must point out to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government that there are many people who reach the age of 60, or maybe even older, whose house has fallen into disrepair. They will not leave the place where they were born and reared. All they are asking for is a demountable home to placed on a site, and even connected to their own septic tank. It is very clear. I am asking the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to examine this. It is not fair to deny these people who want the right to stay where they were born and reared. It is likewise in the case of the rural cottages.To think that 35 applicants have to wait five more years to be housed, if they will be at all, in the rural place where they want to live on their farms and close to their parents. The Government wants to move them all into the large urban areas. I cannot understand why. These people have their own water and septic tanks and they are burdening no one but the Government cannot see as far as its nose.	spk_19

I support the call that certainty and fairness be applied to rents for students in third level education. Students and parents, especially those who cannot access SUSI - and many middle income earners are not entitled to a grant - find themselves under immense financial pressure to go through the third level education process. Accommodation, college fees, living expenses and travel can easily exceed €9,000 and even €10,000 for each student.Students from all around Kerry have long distances to travel to Cork, Limerick, Galway, Dublin and Waterford from places like Lauragh, Kenmare, Cahirciveen, Dingle, Tralee, Killarney, Listowel and all the places in between. These are savage distances to reach their accommodation and their colleges. I have seen students who work during their holidays and at weekends and who earned between €3,000 and €5,000, if they had a good job, at weekends, holidays and bank holidays to help their parents but that puts their parents over the threshold and deprives them of the grant. This anomaly should be rectified because it is good for students and youngsters to work. If they start off by working they will continue working. They can easily go the wrong way, the easy way, if they do not start off by working. It is vital that something be done to ensure that, whatever else happens, the money the student earns is not included in the assessment for the grant application. I appeal to the Minister of State to consider that because I have seen it hurt them when it is taken into account in the parents’ assessment. 	spk_347

I do not think the Taoiseach is listening to us at all when we raise this issue. It is not fair. People can get into nursing homes but that is not where elderly people want to finish up.

We are talking about people who are out on the sea. Their lives are in danger most of the time while they are trying to eke a very difficult living, dealing with the elements most of the time. It is wrong to think that small infringements by these people will be dealt with via a statutory instrument. He should bring legislation through this House in order that we can all see what he is doing. Why does he not do that? Why is he beholden to Europe, which is not always on our side? This will affect everyone, down to the smallest operator. A tribunal, where a lesser standard of proof is required, is proposed to incriminate people and penalise them. That is my gripe with what the Minister is doing. He is very close to Castletownbere, Dingle, Cahirciveen and all those places. I am amazed that the Minister is taking this high-handed action to deal with all the hard-working people whose lives are in danger most of the days they are out at sea. There are regulations requiring them to attend within a number of days. The number of days must be extended to give them a chance to defend themselves.	spk_253

Time was needed to reflect on what had happened here yesterday evening and last night with the votes and the subsequent votes after decisions were made. These decisions are now very questionable. We are in what I would consider uncharted waters. Having received advice on this subject today, if the Bill leaves this House and goes to the Seanad and the Seanad is let do what it likes with it, the Bill will still have to come back here to us again. This is completely unprecedented. To say that it is an unmitigated mess would not be an exaggeration. I do not think something like this has ever happened before in this way. That is why it is so important. One would have to question what we are doing with this Bill at all. What are we trying to achieve with it? What are we questioning? Why are we doing what we are doing? If any outside person who was knowledgeable of the legal process and the systems, checks and balances that are in place was to stand outside the Chamber, that person would now ask what these politicians are actually trying to achieve because what we have done so far is to make an absolute mess of it. The one person who has been highly vindicated is the person who christened this Bill a dog's dinner. It was probably the most apt description of a Bill that ever came before this House. Nobody can question his judgment, because his judgment and verdict on this Bill was 100% bang on and he has been proven right.	spk_287

The way things are going, we should not be talking at all. This Bill is about appointing people with knowledge to select judges, on whom we rely to mete out justice and give people a fair and balanced hearing. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board comprises the Chief Justice, who is the chairman, the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court, the Attorney General, a practising barrister nominated by the Council of the Bar of Ireland, a practising solicitor nominated by the Law Society of Ireland, and no more than three persons appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality. It is proposed that the chairman of the commission be a lay person. Also to be included are the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court. At the end of the list is a reference to six lay members selected by the Public Appointments Service. The service must ensure a lay person will not be recommended for appointment as chairperson of the commission unless it is satisfied that he or she is a fit and proper person to be so appointed and is suitable for appointment having due regard to ""his or her having demonstrated experience of effective board management and corporate governance"". Who is going to check out all that? Why would someone in that capacity have gained as much knowledge as a judge, who would have operated as a solicitor or barrister before becoming a District Court judge or Circuit Court judge? The Public Appointments Service must also be satisfied as to ""his or her having such experience, qualifications, training or expertise as is appropriate having regard to the functions of the Commission"" and to ""the desirability that he or she has knowledge of-----"	spk_429
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-05-23	dail	32	Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017: Report Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_44	"Yes, but this is about changing the system we have and purporting that what is being brought forward is better than it. The person appointed is supposed to have knowledge or experience of the operation of the courts. Who could have more knowledge than a judge or solicitor? Section 12 refers to the provision of supports to persons who are victims of crime or to users of the services provided by the courts. Again, who could know more about this than the judges, solicitors or barristers? Section 12 refers to ""processes and procedures for making appointments to public office or to senior positions in public or private sector organisations"". Who is going to decide who these people are? For over 100 years we had a system that served the country well. Why is it that we are changing it now because of the wishes of one man who wrote so much in the newspapers and whose idea it was that Governments and Ministers should not appoint judges anymore? Is it because of that? Is that why we are going to wreck the perfect justice system we have had for 100 years and throw it out the window? Is it just to satisfy one man and ensure his support for the Government? Surely nothing could be more ridiculous. Section 12(4) states the Public Appointments Service shall ensure that a lay person is recommended under subsection (2) for appointment as chairperson only if it is satisfied that the person is a fit and proper person to be so appointed and is suitable for appointment by reason of the person possessing such experience, qualifications, training or expertise as is appropriate having regard to the functions of the commission. Why are we doing this? Why is the Government allowing this to happen when it knows this is the most ridiculous Bill that has ever come before the House, in my time anyway? Members who are here longer than I am will say the very same thing. The Public Appointments Service is advised that the general scheme of the Bill contained a provision to the effect that, in appointing lay members to the commission, the Minister must have regard to the objective of having gender balance. That is fine but I believe knowledge and experience should come before deciding whether the person should be a man or woman. I have no objection to women but surely it should come down to experience, not just gender balance. It is absolutely ridiculous. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has just been replaced in the Chamber by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who is also part of the Government. They are succumbing to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to ensure his support for the Government. It does not matter whether it is a good or bad Bill but, since it is the Bill of the latter Minister, the Government must support it. What is going on is ridiculous. I appeal to the Government to address this. In light of what happened last night, we do not know whether the commission will have 13 members or 17. We are talking in a vacuum.However, that is costing the taxpayers and I ask the Minister to do the proper thing and withdraw the Bill sooner rather than later because it will finish up in the courts. If the Bill ever becomes law, it will not happen for years when there will be a different Administration in this Chamber."	spk_431

It is about keeping him on side in order that he will continue to support the Government. He has been promoting this proposal for many years even before he was elected to this Dáil. It is clear that our Judiciary has been exemplary in all those years and in spite of everything, it is clear to me and many others that judges gave fair, honest and impartial judgment on whoever came before them over the years. The Bill indicates a change in the way judges are to be appointed. My worry is that lay persons will be recruited by the Public Appointments Service. Who will select those who will effect that recruitment? Will it not be done by the Cabinet, the Government or Members? How could that be right? There will be lay people selecting judges who may or may not have any idea of how to select a judge according to competency, fairness and ability, which is most important. Is that going to be a consideration at all? I am very worried about this. The proposal is for a lay majority, which is absolutely ridiculous. I cannot see how that would be fair at all. The Bar Council is totally opposed to this idea of lay persons being in charge of judicial appointments. It is correct in that assessment. I cannot see how lay members in this job could have the experience that judges accumulate over years on the bench, dealing with all the aspects, problems and cases that come before them. How could lay members have that knowledge in the space of a couple of years? It is absurd to think that is where we are just to please one Minister and to keep him on side. It is bad enough what he is doing to people in rural Ireland but if he gets away with doing this to our justice system, it will make a farce of the whole thing. There would be a lay chair recruited by the Public Appointments Service, which is totally absurd and wrong. The majority would have to be lay members but there must be an ability to form a strategic objective and provide leadership to implement changes to the body.Very good people could come forward, but we are exposing ourselves to the unknown. We already know what we have in place. I ask the Government to go back and look at what it is doing. It just wants to satisfy the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. That is ridiculous. Again, I ask the Minister for Justice and Equality about the Public Appointments Service. Who will appoint those involved? Judges have always provided fair and honest judgments. They had the experience to do so because many of them started off as solicitors and progressed up the line and became District Court or Circuit Court judges and, eventually, High Court judges. That was the right way to do it. It has worked, as I said, for over 100 years. I appeal to the Government to take another look at what it is doing because I believe we are going down the wrong road in what we are doing with this Bill. As the earlier speakers have said, we now hear the Bill is getting support from Sinn Féin. There must be something happening. Then Sinn Féin elects a Fine Gael Senator to the vacant Seanad seat.	spk_310

It is ridiculous when one reads here that the PAS must ensure that a layperson will not be recommended for appointment as chairperson of the commission unless it is satisfied that she or he is a fit and proper person. Deputy Ó Snodaigh could be right in saying that other people around the country have judicial and legal knowledge as well as the people at the Bar, judges or whoever, but will those people end up on the commission? That is the question.  While I did not select them, let us look at what the Citizens' Assembly has inflicted on the country. Who picked its members? How were they assessed? If we are going to have a commission in line with something like that body, we are looking for trouble. The Chief Justice has a tried and trusted record under his belt with 30 or 40 years of service on every level from solicitor to barrister, to District Court judge, to Circuit Court judge all the way up along the line.

I support the motion for the provision of affordable houses to buy or to rent. It is a very laudable idea. There are many couples and young people struggling to pay even the rent. Consider the town of Killarney, for example, where rents of more than €1,000 and €1,200 per month are now common. Rent of €2,000 per month has been asked for houses in and around Killarney. With the incomes people have, and with families and everything else, they cannot afford these rents. When they get a notice to quit, which many of them seem to be getting recently and especially around Killarney, Tralee and Castleisland, they are very worried that they will not find a home, that they will be out on the road or their family will finish up in one room in the homeless centres in Tralee or Killarney. They are scared of their lives of this happening. Many couples are very worried about this. This evening I want to determine the funding available for demountable homes, which I have come across in Kerry. The information I have heard from the housing section is that it is hard to get money from the Department to fund demountable homes. These people have an asset which is the site on which to place the demountable home. I want to determine if the Government is giving enough money to the local authorities or if it is the case that something has happened whereby the local authority is not approving this funding. I praise our local authority, especially the housing section and the grants section, for the great work it is doing giving grants to older people and to those who have a disability so they can stay in their homes for longer. That is where everybody wants to stay. Deputy Collins has said that many houses are vacant but I do not agree with my colleague that these houses should be knocked or taken away from the owners. I believe that many of those who have a house and who cannot use it for the time being may come back when they get the opportunity. Funding must be made available for rural cottages because, again, those people have the sites.	spk_615

People are horrified by recent disclosures. I thank Emma Mhic Mhathúna and Vicky Phelan for publicising what happened to them and speaking so eloquently about how their lives have been changed forever. It appears the Government has decided to establish a new board to monitor the Health Service Executive. This is not the right approach as it will create another buffer of bureaucracy between elected members and the HSE, which already has enough managers. There are enough Ministers in the Department of Health to hold HSE managers to account for what they are not doing. I have asked the Minister many times to take HSE managers to task for what they were not doing in various areas, which I do not propose to list. The HSE receives a large amount of money and it is not held to account for how it is spending it. A veil of secrecy operates in many departments and areas of the health service. I am familiar with this from attending meetings of the HSE's regional health forum, south. When I tabled motions and asked questions, HSE officials showed themselves to be masters of not answering the question I asked or addressing the motion I tabled. This is not fair to elected representatives and the people we represent who ask that we provide a health service. As far as I can see, there is no accountability among senior managers in the HSE. Open disclosure by doctors and HSE managers must be introduced. Many patients have lost confidence in the HSE and I wonder if they will ever regain confidence in the HSE after what has happened. This is a serious matter and I recognise the Minister understands that is the case. However, as Minister, he has power and he must act to sort out the problem. He also has four Ministers of State. Now is the time to act.  The deliberate hiding of information from patients was a criminal act and those responsible should be held accountable because they were the cause of many people dying. 	spk_454

I thank the Minister also, as I understand he is supportive of this Bill. Each and every one of us here needs to work together to do something to help people with gambling problems. It develops into a sickness and has wide-ranging implications for wives and children. Tables are left empty, the light is not paid for and cannot be turned on and families break up. Very capable people get stuck in this rut and it takes everything from them. They lose their job, their business and everything that is worthwhile. It is too easy now with the phone, the computer and gambling online. Something has to be done. Regulation will have to be put in place. We will all have to work together to ensure that something is done. I know of a lovely couple that had everything, including lovely children. Their house is gone and they are practically out on the road. The poor little children had a future in front of them. We do not know where they will finish up now or what will happen to them. That is what is happening and it is widespread. There are different addictions - including drug addiction and alcohol addiction - but this is a serious problem as well. It is taking everything from people and causing depression and suicide. It is one of the major upsets happening in our community, near us and all around us. We cannot understand it. Something needs to be done to regulate this business because it is having devastating effects.	spk_358

Sadly, I believe one family lost three members. Since then, the local authority has been more proactive in insisting that radon barriers are put in place to diminish any further effects when building a new house. In three cases people wanted to knock down their old house and build a new house in order to install all these radon barriers, only to be told that the heritage section of the local authority wanted to leave the houses standing. It took a fair amount of persuasion to ensure that these people were allowed to do what they intended to do initially, which was to demolish the old house and to build a new house with all the protection they could have from radon gas. I wanted to get in those important points. We seem to be talking a lot in this Chamber, and rightfully so, about protecting life. People can also lose their lives from these and have done in the two matters I raised. 	spk_268

Places like Louth and Wexford, and all the coastline in between, are very close to Britain. It could be much more troublesome if England finally leaves the European market because we will have less of a say. The west coast of England is almost as near to the east coast of Ireland as Dublin is to Galway if one looks at it in that way. It is very important that we would monitor this and have a say, which is what I am demanding. We need to protect Irish people who are living on this island. As a Government and as a Parliament, we cannot dismiss the threat of a nuclear station being built in close proximity to our country and the adverse effect it might have on people living here or trying to do so.	spk_279
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-05-08	dail	32	Health Service Reform: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_35	I thank Deputy Michael Harty and Mairead and David in Deputy Mattie McGrath's office for putting the motion together for us. It gives me the opportunity to speak on a few very important matters. Waiting times for beds in Tralee General Hospital are unacceptable, with people waiting for two or three days. It is ridiculous. Front-line staff are an issue and we do not have enough nurses. The hospital is overcrowded and Dingle Community Hospital is only half-opened, as is the new hospital in Kenmare. We need a new facility in Killarney because the population doubles and triples at certain times of the year. We are waiting for it and have been told we are getting it but it cannot come soon enough. In the case of St. Mary of the Angels, decongregated settings have to be reviewed. One size does not fit all. Two patients were moved out in the past three years and in June last year one of them was so agitated they kept giving him anti-psychotic drugs. He cannot talk but can lip read and they gave him 28 doses in June last year, with the result that he is now blind. He cannot talk, hear or see now and that is what the decongregated model has done to him. His family has no problem with me naming him but I will not do that. His life has effectively been ended by this. St. Mary of the Angels is being closed by stealth. St. John of God will not take in any more patients and it will close because the patients will die off. The group is trying to do its best but HIQA is changing the goalposts and saying there is not enough room for the patients, so that they now have to fundraise and need to collect €180,000 to build three chalets so that they can keep the patients they have. Parents and friends are doing this work and they are hoping they will get money out of the Ring of Kerry charity cycle. While that is happening, €750,000 is being spent on a house in Cromane to take one patient out of St. Mary of the Angels but no one is fit to go there at the moment, so grass is growing around the house. Someone is being paid to maintain it but nobody is inside. There is another patient in another town in Kerry and no one knows what it is costing. It is costing an unreal amount of money to pay all the nurses and everyone else to mind one patient when they were getting on fine in St. Mary of the Angels. We have five Ministers in the Department of Health and a Government but I know of one poor lady who has an adult son with autism and when she goes to bed every night she locks her door because she is afraid of him. Two or three years ago a son killed his mother and it will happen again if the Minister does not wake up. There was another Minister in Kerry spouting about what money he had got from the Government to deal with these things but on the eastern side of Kerry there is no place to deal with an adult autistic child, who is still a child despite the fact they may be aged 23 or 24 and very strong. This poor woman is afraid and I ask the Minister to address these issues. He should get on his bicycle and go around to listen to the people. When I highlighted the young fella who went blind at St. Mary of the Angels, the only thing St. John of God wanted to know was who told me the story. In other words, it should not have been raised at all. These people want to keep these things in the dark but we are talking about real people, human beings who are not being looked after. They are the most vulnerable people and I appeal to the five Ministers in the Department of Health to do something about it. They know about these things and it is time to act.	spk_351
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-05-02	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_17	The provision of housing is one of the main aims of this Government, and it is in the programme for Government. The tenant purchase scheme was a vital part of housing in all local authorities. For a number of years we did not have a tenant purchase scheme. In the past three years, a new tenant purchase scheme was introduced but only 80% of applicants are qualifying for the scheme. Pensioners have savings, and have spent years in their houses, yet they do not qualify for the scheme that will allow them purchase their house. I want the Minister to do something about that. I have a question about another aspect of housing. The Minister said he would provide funding for emergency housing, namely, demountable homes, in our local authority area. I hear from people every day that the Department is refusing, delaying and not providing money for this vital housing need. The people who are seeking demountable homes have the space to put them in place. People in Dublin are buying expensive sites and so on but the people in our county have the space to erect a demountable home. I have been told that the Department is not allocating funding to our local authority to buy these demountable homes.	spk_197
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-05-02	dail	32	Mental Health Parity Bill 2017: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_32	I thank Deputy Browne for introducing the Bill and for the opportunity to talk on the issue. The Deputy is right that we are not giving treatment to people who present with mental health issues comparable with the treatment given to people who present with physical or other health issues. I will talk about Kerry. To go back in time, there were 1,200 patients in St. Finan's mental institution. There were many people in there who should not have been there. There were people in there who needed treatment. We have gone from that figure down to very few in our county. Young people presenting with mental health issues are not able to get one-to-one treatment which they need 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I know of a family that lost its lovely 23 year old son. He told his parents that he had problems and issues. I will not say where he was taken but he did not get treatment and he is, sadly, no longer with us. His family is heartbroken. There is a vacant chair at the table and he will never sit in it again. He was very good. He told them all he had a problem but he did not get the help he needed. There are many other cases like that. We do not have enough to deal with them. It is a serious issue. There are only hours in it. Some people who were seen are fine. They are living and are with us today. I thank Denis and Marie O'Carroll in Killarney who lost their son Nathan 11 years ago. They started the Darkness into Light walk every year. It has been done since then and we will be doing it again this year. I thank those in Pieta House for the help and work they do and the other people who volunteer around Killarney and Tralee and elsewhere around our county who are trying to help people who present with mental health issues. We need more assistance from the HSE. It needs to be recognised more by the Department of Health. What Deputy Browne is asking for should be acceded to. Another issue is that when young fellows or young girls who were getting treatment or help from doctors have to leave the treatment because they turn 18, the do not get the continuity of service they received until they were 18. There is something wrong with this because they are still very young at 18 and 19 years of age and they should be getting the same treatment.	spk_377
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-05-02	dail	32	Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Bill 2017: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_35	It is important to say a few words on this penalty which should be used to confiscate the properties, buildings, lands, chattels, vehicles, etc. held by drug lords and criminals. The penalty should fit the crime. It is a different story for parents whose children are being born today at a time when drugs are available around our country. As they bring up their children, they have to face the scourge of drugs that are readily available in our towns and, in some cases, although I do not wish to name any places, in our villages. It has gone down to that. If we can break down these devils and demons by confiscating their property, that is to be applauded and supported. Given that it is necessary to provide social housing to people who do not have a roof over their heads and may never be able to put a roof over their heads, I suggest that buildings which are confiscated under this legislation should be turned over to local authorities for use as social housing. That would penalise individuals who are involved in criminality while at the same time helping people who need social housing. I will be supporting this worthy amendment.	spk_439
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-05-02	dail	32	Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Bill 2017: Report and Final Stages	dbsect_35	I support this amendment as well because it is important that our system has better powers to deal with these people. They were giving us the two fingers from abroad and doing practically whatever they liked. They took the view that they were untouchable in certain countries. I am unsure how far this will extend or whether those in other countries can still evade our laws and operate criminal rackets from afar. This is important. There are drugs coming in around our shores. We must congratulate the Garda on the great work done and for much of the apprehending of people caught bringing drugs. People are serving time in many cases. However, the problem remains because of the people who put drivers into lorries or who have people take the drugs or whatever. The real managers and bosses are still evading conviction in this country because the law was not good enough to deal with them. I hope this amendment will deal with these people. It hurts me when I see young people who started out well in life but lost their way because of drugs being readily available. Perhaps when their defences were down a little they started using drugs. These monsters or predators enticed such people into what I would call a desperate disease whereby they developed a craving for drugs. Not alone does it upset the person concerned, it upsets partners, children, fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters. It brings them to a new kind of low that they thought they would never encounter in their families. When one person in the family is affected, it affects the rest of the family as well as friends and members of small communities. I support the amendment. I am supportive of any way that we can deal with these villains in a stronger fashion.	spk_446
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-05-02	dail	32	Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017: Report Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_36	"I sympathise with all the families who have lost loved ones due to drunk driving. I emphasis ""drunk driving"", however, because I do not believe that someone who has consumed a pint, or a pint and a half, and is under 80 mg is a drunk driver. The Minister is on some kind of a crusade and does not have constituents in rural areas who depend on their car to get to work, college or anywhere. In rural Ireland there are no other means of transport and there has been no attempt to ensure people can be catered for in this way. If a mother or father go to work but lose their licence, as Deputies Troy and Michael Healy-Rae said, as a result of having more than 50 mg in their blood tomorrow morning they can lose everything, because without a licence in rural Ireland they cannot get anywhere or do anything. They have to be driven everywhere and that is too costly. It is hard to get a licence back and it is hard to get insurance again. I am sorry that the Minister described me as a ""road traffic terrorist"" and spoke of me and my ""gang"" in some other forum today. I have a family at home and I do not think the Minister would like to be called a terrorist. I will deal with that in another fashion and I have sought legal advice. I never hurt or harmed anybody and never thought I would be so described. I have a licence to drive every vehicle on the road and I am proud of that. I got my first licence to drive a tractor aged 16 and did a driving test in a motor car, a rigid lorry, an articulated lorry and a large coach. I am licensed to pull a trailer after a coach and I am proud of that too. I am very hurt by being called a terrorist and the Minister will answer to someone, somewhere, as to what he means by that because I am not letting it go. Maybe the Minister has lost the run of himself because there was mention of some of them going to Korea to sort terrorists out there."	spk_499
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-05-02	dail	32	Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017: Report Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_36	I do not know why I should be called a terrorist when I only represent the people of Kerry who elected me and my brother to this House. The Minister could just as well be calling those people terrorists as well. The Minister has thrown a lot of things at me in this debate, such as the accusation that I was fighting this for publicans, but in the course of scoraíochting in Kerry, people went to each other's house to visit and break the monotony of their lives. Nowadays, they have to drive because their neighbours are further away and the closer neighbours have left or emigrated. Rural Ireland was badly hit in the 1950s but in recent times it has been hit much worse. People drive to each other's houses but they cannot even have one drink now because they cannot be sure they will be under the limit and they will be afraid of losing their licence. The one bit of recreation they had, which was to go to neighbours' houses, will be lost. It is not about publicans but about loneliness and having something to do in rural places, where they do not have theatres, cinemas, basketball courts or gyms. They will now be totally isolated and will have to listen to the radio, because there is not much to watch on the television nowadays. Deputy Troy asked why we were being scapegoated. In Northern Ireland one can legally drive with less than 80 mg, and the same is true in England. There is a lot of talk about a hard or soft Border but we are only one field away from Northern Ireland in many parts of the Twenty-six Counties.We will have a less severe rule in the North and a more severe rule in the South. In France, a person who is found to have between 50 mg and 80 mg of alcohol per 100 mg of blood will only be fined. In the debacle around breath tests we learned that numbers had been doubled and trebled, such that nobody knows the true number of breath tests conducted. We also can no longer trust the figures being provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Minister mentioned that there were 36 fatalities between 2008 and 2012 which were in the 20 mg to 80 mg bracket, of which 19 were in the 20 mg to 50 mg bracket. As such, the Minister's argument does not make sense. I asked for a breakdown of those 36 fatalities to include if the accident was caused by a drunk pedestrian walking along the road who had fallen onto the road in front of the car; a person who had had two glasses of lager or Guinness and was driving on their own side of the road meeting another driver with no alcohol who was speeding, lost control of a car and crashed into the person's car and maybe killed himself and his wife. I got no answer to those questions. I also asked if among those 36 fatalities was a young fella who had one pint after work who met black ice on the way home and hit a bridge to which I also got no answer. I oppose drunk driving but I honestly believe that a person with a pint and a half or 50 mg to 80 mg of alcohol is not a drunk driver. I note Fine Gael is supporting the Bill. It is supporting the Minister for his support for Government to make up the numbers. I regret this because I know so many Fine Gael Deputies enjoy the support of people in rural Ireland who will be hurt by this Bill. If this Bill would reduce accidents or fatalities I would be behind it too but I do not believe it will. In the city of Dublin, there are many modes of transport, including taxis, the DART service, buses and trains. A person with his or her thumb up in Gearhasallagh, the Black Valley or Lauragh would be waiting a long time and no bus or taxi will come. He or she could not phone for a taxi because there is no coverage in most of those parts. The Minister is welcome to Kerry any time but if he does come he should not try thumbing a lift around the Incheese because he could be there from May to November and no car would come along. The Minister would be fairly cold and would still not have got a drive. It must be realised that this will have a serious, detrimental impact on people who lose their licence as it is so hard to get it back. They will lose their insurance, and may never get it back. I appeal to the Minister and the Government. I know many members of Fianna Fáil do not support the Minister but I do not know what the Fianna Fáil leadership is saying or doing. Many fine Fianna Fáil members oppose what the Minister is doing but we do not know what way they will vote. I will be voting against this Bill. Many of the people about whom I am speaking would vote against if as well if permitted to do so. The Minister is so anxious about this Bill that he broke every rule in the book when he came in here one day, sitting in the second row, reached forward and pressed the voting button of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and he got away with it. Had I or Deputy Michael Healy-Rae done that we would be on every news programme in the world about what kind of criminals we were, but the Minister, because he is Minister Ross, got away with it. Whatever happens with this Bill, we will continue to go after Deputy Ross because that was illegal. Regardless of whether he is a Minister or Lord Ross or whatever he is called, in doing that he broke every rule in the book.	spk_501
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-05-02	dail	32	Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017: Report Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_36	We will be challenging it because it was an illegal vote. The Minister might be laughing now but we will challenge it as far as we can. The Minister does not seem to care. He is on some kind of a crusade, some kind of a power ego trip, to get this Bill through. However, he does not realise he is hurting honest, good living people. I am speaking for Kerry. Every other Deputy can speak for their own rural area because people in those areas will be hurt too. No accidents or fatalities were caused by people in the 50 mg to 80 mg bracket. The Minister needs to realise what he is doing. He does not realise how the people of rural Ireland have to manage, where a car is everything. Under this legislation a person found to be 5 mg over the 50 mg permitted will be put off the road for three months. The person's employer may not wait and the children may not be able to go to school. It will make a vast difference and rural Ireland will never again be the same after the Minister, with the support of Fine Gael, enacts this legislation. Rural Ireland is being hit. Since I came up here there has been so much talk about what the Government will do for rural Ireland. This Bill is another way in which it is hurting rural Ireland. All people in rural Ireland asked for is to be left alone but they are not being left alone. They are being targeted by so many other different things, and now the Minister is targeting them. I know they never did anything wrong to the Minister and they never would. This Bill will hurt them for ever more. Ye threw it at us that it was fostering or aiding and abetting public houses. However, I am after outlining to the Minister that it will affect people who visit friends and neighbours across their parish and locally. This legislation will hurt them because they will not even be able to have one bottle of beer while having a conversation. All of that is gone forever. On the roads I am talking about, the most speed a person can do is 20 miles per hour in second or third gear. There will be no car ahead or behind you. On the first day I went to the committee that was discussing this Bill I made the Minister aware that farmers have only one vehicle. They either have a van, a jeep or a small tractor yet they are being treated the same as a professional driver in terms of the 20 mg limit. I am asking the Minister to do something about this.I ask that something be done at least to bring them up out of that bracket because they are treated the very same as an articulated truck driver or a professional bus driver doing the maximum speed on the motorway. Even though they may only have a small jeep, a small van or a small tractor, their limit is 21 mg. This is the way they are being treated by the law. People are also being told that if they use their commercial van for private purposes, for example, to go to mass, and they are caught, the law will be applied forcefully. The person is supposed to have what is known as private tax on the van. If the person is caught using the van or jeep for his or her private business, such as going shopping, going to mass or any social event, the person is supposed to have private tax on the vehicle which costs about three times more. If, however, the person is caught in the same van with 21 mg of alcohol in their blood, he or she will be put off the road. I asked the Minister to do something about this and he said he would look at it, but he did not do anything about it. All the Minister is interested in is putting people off the road. I do not support this Bill because it will not help to reduce accidents. There are myriad things that would help, with the support of the Minister. As I came to the Dáil yesterday, I noticed a branch hanging over the road between Mallow and Kildorrery. It will fall down onto somebody. I have told the Minister about this stretch of road before. It is in a very precarious state. The branch is not very big, but if it hit a woman who might be travelling along the road with her children, she would be killed. She would then be a statistic. The Minister just does not care. He could have had something done about the trees since the recent terrible storms by making a law to help landowners who cannot actually go out on the road for fear of being blown off it. The local authorities, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, farmers and landowners should work together to ensure that nothing falls onto the traffic travelling on the road. That type of situation can kill. The Minister, however, has no interest in that. All he wants to do is paralyse these grand people in rural Ireland and put them off the road. It looks like the Minister is getting his way because he has the support of Fine Gael. We do not know about the others. Sinn Féin supports the Bill also, even though its members are elected by rural people. Sinn Féin will have to answer when they call to people's doors. I would advise those Deputies not to bring the Minister with them because they will not get very much support. Having supported the Minister, I do not know what would happen those parties. I do not wish bad to anyone but I guarantee that those Deputies should not appear behind the Minister because he is not welcome in many places around rural Kerry. This will hurt-----	spk_505

I hope he told the licensing authority that because if he has not done so, he will not be insured in a car he might drive. Perhaps now that he is a Minister with his own driver, he does not care about having a licence or not, but fine for him if he does. I put it to the Minister and to all the Deputies in the Chamber that this is the most serious blow to rural Ireland and to people who just cannot manage without a car. If they lose their licence, they will be stranded at home and will be lonelier than ever. I do not believe this will save one life. This is my honest humble belief. A pint or a half pint is certainly not dangerous and people could be under 80 mg. They kind of say that they know that anyway when one looks at England, the North of Ireland and France. Deputy Troy referred to states in America which allow over 80 mg, but we in Ireland are guinea pigs: ""Let us test these fellas out and put them off the road; these fellas do not matter."" Reference was made to rural transport and that the Minister would propose the operation of 36 or 38 buses in rural parts of the State. I put it to the Minister that 36 buses or taxis would not do a quarter of Kerry, not to mind the rest of the country. The Minister is only trying to cod the people. That is not what he is actually doing. The people of Ireland know, and the people in rural Ireland know, they are being militated against and that there is no necessity whatsoever for this Bill. One of my amendments provides that the three penalty points would remain but that if a person was caught or detected in the bracket of 50 mg to 80 mg, he or she would be obliged to undertake ten driving lessons with a qualified driving instructor. This would be beneficial because drivers everywhere need to do refresher courses to keep up with new legislation and new ideas. This measure could benefit people in rural areas. Some people may not come into towns or cities often and it would bring them up to speed about new laws, new systems, new ways of driving and so on. I will be moving that amendment. The Rural Independent Group members have different amendments. Deputies Mattie McGrath and Michael Collins will deal with amendments Nos. 14 and 17. My amendment is amendment No. 15. It would be beneficial, if we were to go down this route and in the spirit of improvement, for drivers who are detected to have to do ten driving lessons with a qualified instructor. The Minister's proposal for an NCT for tractors will hurt so many people. He has angered and aggravated many people by what he has proposed. I do not know where the Minister is getting his ideas from but if it is from the Department, it is to be regretted. I believe the Minister is on a crusade of his own with regard to the new drink driving penalty. This is to be regretted. No one in any Department, or in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, could suggest it so it must be the Minister's own idea. Given what the Minister did with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone's voting button, it proves that he is very anxious to get this over the line. A great many cyclists are killed. In the Heritage Bill, we ask that roadside hedges are kept cut all year round because people use the roads all year round. The hedges and briars prevent cyclists and walkers from keeping close to the ditches. In Dublin, there are motorways and the roads are wide. Where I come from, a 3 m road width is about what one gets in the rural countryside and maybe less at times. When the hedge growth goes beyond the yellow line, people are practically walking in the middle of the road and if it is after nightfall and is dark, then pedestrians and cyclists are killed. There is no attempt by the Minister and no interest on his part. The Minister should be the first to go into the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development to suggest doing something to support us when we look to get these roadside hedges cut, and to keep them cut all year round. There is no accountability. He was out somewhere in the middle of Dublin calling me, Danny Healy-Rae, and his gang terrorists. There is a drainage programme but there is nothing about ponding water, which is taking roads completely over. People are being killed in those instances too. When they meet another car and there is a lake of water in the middle of the road, and one is doing 40 mph or 50 mph, one cannot then see where one is because 20 gallons of water might have gone up on the windscreen. Nothing is being done about that, even on national primary roads. I could take the Minister around Kerry but I will not. He will have to make it himself. I could go on for the next 20 hours because the Minister is hurting so many people. There is no need for it. He will achieve nothing by it. It is an ego trip by the Minister so that in 20 years' time, he can say Shane Ross did this. That is what he will have to his name. I have talked so much about this because in my heart, I feel strongly about it and regret what he is doing. I will also regret that it will have been in my time here that this happened. I will say to the people of Kerry and all over the rural parts of Ireland that it was not for want of trying. The Minister has the votes and will win it unless he changes his hat or direction and I do not think he will do that. It was not for want of me fighting the Minister. I am sorry that the people of rural Ireland will be hurt. The Minister is the man who is stopping them from having one and a half pints. He is the man who thought of it and Fine Gael supported him. I will never forgive the Minister for it. The people of Kerry will never forgive him and the people in rural Ireland who have no other way to travel but their car will never forget him for it. He will be remembered for that. I do not appreciate it."	spk_511

It is €1,200 a month. I want to ask about the housing assistance payment cap. The housing assistance payment in Kerry is capped at €575. Other counties have a much higher cap. In light of the increase in the cost of houses per month, which is €1,200 to €2,000 per month in Killarney and other big towns such as Kenmare and Dingle, will the Government do something about raising the housing assistance payment cap in Kerry?	spk_166
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-04-25	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_15	I wish to raise two matters regarding the lack of infrastructure in Kerry. On the N70 road to the west of Blackwater Bridge, on the Kenmare to Sneem road, there is a 4 km section between Foley’s Bend and the west of Tahilla Church where two large vehicles cannot pass when they meet each other. It is not safe. A lorry or bus and one car cannot pass each other but have to reverse. Can one imagine that on a busy national secondary road? An EIS, environmental impact statement, design and CPO, compulsory purchase order, process is being progressed. Improvement works will cost between €8 million and €10 million, depending on what the tenders come in at. Will the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Griffin, ensure funding is made available for this section? There is also another section of a kilometre just west of Blackwater Bridge. No design has been progressed on this yet but this is dangerous. I know it myself. If an articulated lorry passes a car on this part of the road, the car will pass the cab fine but will be caught between the trailer and the ditch. If the car cannot stop, it is stuck in the lorry or the ditch. That improvement would cost between €2 million and €2.5 million. Will the Government make that funding available? The R551, between Ardfert and Ballyheigue, often gets flooded when there is a high tide and heavy rain. Approximately 200 m of this road becomes impassable with a mix of salt and clear water. We are looking for a specific improvement grant or funding to be made available to raise the road by 200 m to ensure the people of Ballyheigue and other road users can get in and out of the village.	spk_122

I know it is an ambition of everyone in this Chamber to ensure that each old person is helped to stay in his or her own home as long as possible. However, we do not have enough home help hours for patients or the elderly in our county. At weekends and on Saturdays and Sundays, it is impossible to get cover. There is no cover for bank holidays. When designated home help people go on holidays, as they are entitled to, or get sick themselves, it is now happening that the old people they assist are left without any home help for two weeks at a time. We have a Minister and four Ministers of State in the Department of Health. I ask them to ensure that more home helps are hired in Kerry and that more hours are given to elderly people who wish to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. It will save the country and the State a lot of money if they do so.	spk_186
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-04-25	dail	32	Nurses' and Midwives' Pay and Recruitment: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_28	I am glad of the opportunity to talk on this important matter. Nurses are under severe pressure in University Hospital Kerry, Killarney Community Hospital, Kenmare and Dingle hospitals and Bantry General Hospital, to which many people from our side of the country go. I remember only too well the intensive care unit of Tralee general hospital as my father was there for many weeks. The night shift used to come on at 8 p.m. and they were to be there until 8 a.m. the following morning. If one was missing, they still carried on. They had to carry on because there was no one to make up the numbers and they had to do the work regardless. The amount of paperwork and work that they do, as well as the load they carry is entirely unfair. When we hear that the HSE is hiring management  I raised the case during the Order of Business the other day of a girl who wanted to come back to get a higher degree in nursing. She gave 23 and a half years in this country before she went. She was away for three and a half years and now she will have to pay double for her course because she was out of the country for more than three of the last five years. She will not qualify for a SUSI grant either. How can the Government expect people to come home when these kinds of regulations are put upon them? This girl had given 24 and a half years of her life in Ireland. She was born here and is one of our own, bred and reared. The rules and regulations are militating against them and that is why they are not coming back. They do not have the right conditions. They are overloaded. They are driven down through the ground with work. The Government is not listening to us. We have five Ministers for health and a Government that is not listening to the people when we are calling for more front-line staff. What are they doing? Employing more managers. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. That is the truth.	spk_370

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-04-25	dail	32	Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017: Report Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_31	That is grand. Again, it is very unfortunate that provisions concerning provisional drivers have been added to the Bill and to think that we will criminalise fathers and mothers - jail them, we are told. People commit serious crimes against old people in rural places and get away with it. They are not even jailed. The Minister said mothers and fathers must drive their children or teenagers with provisional licences to school, to their apprenticeships and to work. If they have two, three or four children, which they may have, are they to spend years driving these youngsters around when they could easily drive themselves? I had a proposal, which the House knows about, that young fellas or girls with provisional licences should have speed limiters fitted to their cars because we know that speed is one of the main reasons for accidents and fatalities. There are modern means of assessing the speed a driver does and it can be monitored and read. If they went over such a speed, we could do all these things to prevent speeding and make them drive more slowly and more safely. However, the Minister wants to go the hard route: jail the fathers and mothers or whoever else owns the cars. This is totally unsatisfactory to rural Ireland, where I come from. Deputy Ryan has left the Chamber, and I do not like talking about people behind their backs, but I did not send him away. I listened to him so I am disappointed he is not listening to me. I can tell him one thing: if the Minister, Deputy Ross, and he joined together, it would be a fairly serious outfit for rural Ireland. One of them on his own is bad enough, but the two of them together would be a serious concoction. I heard Deputy Ryan say he was disappointed to see so many teenagers being driven to school and that more should cycle. If Deputy Ryan were at Kelly's Cross, six miles west of Sneem, where the school bus picks the schoolchildren up, and if we did not have that school bus, and if he is saying they should cycle into Kenmare, it would be dinner time before they landed. They would only be able to stay an hour or two before they would have to think about cycling home again. How ridiculous can he be? The honest truth of it is that I raised the issue of the turns from Blackwater Bridge to Tahilla this morning on Leaders' Questions. That road cannot be cycled safely. One would be killed there because two of anything cannot pass the road. A bicycle would be squeezed. The road cannot be walked safely. Many of our roads are not fit for that, and I am sorry about that. I do not know what Deputy Ryan was aiming at when he stated how many Deputies there are in Kerry and said that so many more people were killed. I do not know what he actually meant by that. It was ridiculous talk. I get on well with Deputy Ryan personally, but what he was talking about is nonsense. He said students would be safer cycling on our roads and that they would not be killed.That is what I understood from him. That is absolutely bunkum. Deputy Harty spoke about Dún Laoghaire and people whose lives are ruined when they finish up in Dún Laoghaire in a serious condition. He made it sound like everyone who ended up in Dún Laoghaire had an accident caused by drink. I know of one poor young fellow who was cycling when it happened to him and he was not cycling on the road. He is outside there now and drink had nothing to do with it. People are trying to cloud the issue and blackguard the people in rural Ireland. That is what they are at. They are trying to isolate them. Like I said last night, they want them to feel like rabbits inside a burrow who are afraid to stick their noses out because something would take a swipe at them. I cannot see the sense in making those points. Deputy Ryan made it sound like the 159 people killed last year on the roads in Ireland were all killed because of drink. That is absolutely rubbish. Someone should be brought to account or provide statistics to tell all of the honest people around the country how those people were killed and why they were killed. Many of them were killed cycling and I am sorry about that; many of them were killed walking and I am sorry about that; many of them were killed driving and I am sorry about that too, for all of the families they leave behind who are hurt, but not all of them were killed because someone had a pint or a pint and a half. I never condone drink driving and I never will. I know what I did any time I saw someone attempting it, but it was rarely I had to do it. I still say that anyone who drinks a pint and a half or who consumes up to 80 mg never caused a fatality and they are safe to drive, and I will stand over this until the day I die. I cannot understand what gripe the Minister has with the people in rural Ireland. I would prefer if the Minister listened to me, but perhaps he is too busy and he does not care. Perhaps this is the other reason. He is certainly not interested in saving lives because if he were he would attempt to do something about the trees that are crossing our roads. A few months ago, in Storm Ophelia, three people lost their lives because of trees on our roads. It does not have to be a tree that falls on a car, it can be just a branch that will fall when the wind is blowing and come in the windscreen of a poor woman bringing children home and perhaps kill the children in the car also. The entire family and extended family would be upset and ruined forever. The Minister is making no attempt to deal with this. Take the road from Mallow to Kildorrery. Branches from trees along that road fell in the storm and they are still there, half hanging out over the road. No order or cognisance is taken of these situations and no audit has been done. The Minister could do it because he is the Minister with responsibility for transport and safety on the roads, but he just does not want to make an attempt to do so. He wants to make a name for himself this way, and this is what he is at. Look at all of the junctions. I highlighted this before but I make no apology for highlighting it again. Look at all of the dangerous junctions around Killarney.	spk_459

Speed is one of the major causes of fatalities. So is tiredness when driving long distances, as people have to do now. They have to get up early in the morning and drive from places such as Cahersiveen in Kerry to Cork or Limerick and drive back home again. It makes a long day out of it and people are tired driving. There is little public transport to help or assist people travelling these distances. Mobile phones have caused many accidents. I have spoken about the ponding of water on our roads. There is a drainage programme but, as I understand it, it is a programme for draining the sides of county roads. It does not deal with the ponding of water on our regional roads or even on our national secondary roads. The inlets are closed. The section men knew where these inlets were but, sadly, we do not have the section men and no one knows where these inlets are now, so when it rains we have lakes of water on our roads-----	spk_476

What will help the people who will be isolated in rural areas because they cannot go to have the one bit of comfort they have, to meet their friends and neighbours in a pub? I heard other Deputies say there were several places for people to go in rural areas, but in most of the county I know the rural villages have only a pub and there are no other facilities for people in rural areas. At one stage, Deputy Heydon suggested 33 or 35 buses would be put in place to take people home. Surely he is not serious that they would cover all of the 26 counties or, if we leave out Dublin, 25 counties. We could also leave out Cork city. Those buses would not cover the rural parts of Cork or Kerry on their own. No realisation is given to what will happen people in rural Ireland. They are lonely as it is but they will be made lonelier, especially farmers and gentlemen living on their own who have little to look forward to after their hard day's work or hard week's work.

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-04-24	dail	32	Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017: Instruction to Committee	dbsect_31	I am totally opposed to provisional drivers being added to the Bill because it will affect young fellows in rural Ireland. The Minister need not shake his head because it will affect them. It has already affected one young fellow in Killorglin and a few more in different places. He lost his apprenticeship because he could not get to work. His father and mother could not allow him to take the car any more. They would not take the chance on the journey from Killorglin to Kenmare. Now he is at home and he has no prospect of getting another job. I am opposed to this measure. Several other measures could have been put into the Bill that would help these young drivers, and every young fellow should get one chance. I believe people are entitled to get a chance in this world. We could fit the cars with speed limits and other modern techniques could be used to monitor people's driving and if they went over a certain agreed limit, they would not get insurance or their licence renewed. We could have gone down several other roads, but what the Minister wants to do is to paralyse and isolate them, keep them at home and give them no chance. It is very unfair. The Minister does not care because he is here in a cosy spot in Dublin where he can get at taxi, a DART or a bus. I do not begrudge people in the city who can do things like this, but people in rural places like Killorglin, Glencar, Cahersiveen or Lauragh have no other way to travel without a car. This is the gospel truth and we are not making up lies. I am defending their right to have one chance to go on the road. If they do not get that chance, it is wrong, and the Minister is wrong in what he is doing. Why is the Minister trying to criminalise honest good living people in rural Ireland who have never done anything wrong to anyone? It is sad to think people who are lonely will be made more lonely and more isolated because if people lose their licence in rural Ireland, they are stranded and cannot go to work or go to the shop. With the Minister's new Bill, people will have no opportunity because he suggests people will be put off the road if they are caught in the 50 mg to 80 mg blood alcohol bracket. There is no need whatsoever for this. I asked the Minister at a committee meeting to prove the necessity for this, and he gave instances of cases from 2008 to 2012 and stated that in those four years 36 people were killed in incidents involving alcohol. He did not come out and individualise the cases and prove it was not someone walking along the footpath after having a few pints and stepping in front of a driver who had no drink at all. Could it have been the case that a young fellow who had one pint and was not over the drink-driving limit at the time met black ice and hit a bridge or a pole? Could it have been cases like this? The Minister never proved it. He said data protection would not allow him to give the cases. I am saying to him, to everyone in the Gallery and to anyone who is listening that anyone who drank a pint and a half pint never caused a fatality or an accident. No one in the 50 mg to 80 mg bracket caused a fatality. Is this the price the Minister extracted from the Fine Gael Government? Is this what he got from Fine Gael, to be allowed to introduce these draconian measures? The Fine Gael Deputies, who are not here, have traditionally gone into farmyards and places in rural Ireland and rural Kerry and have got votes there, but I can tell the Minister that if he is anywhere near them they will get no vote at the next election, whenever it will be, because he is hurting people who never did anything wrong to anyone. It is sad to think that a farmer coming home from the mart will not be able to come into the pub to have one pint or maybe a pint and a half pint to tell people what he got for his animals or how the day went for him. All of this will be gone. People will have to stay inside at home. They will be like rabbits inside a burrow when the fox or the harrier is around. They are afraid to peep out because some fellow like the Minister will be outside. This is no laughing matter. This is what the Minister is doing to people in rural Ireland. He is paralysing and isolating them and treating them like dirt. The Minister has the facilities here. He has buses, taxis, DARTs, trains and everything else at any hour of the day or night that he wants. This is not available to people in rural Ireland. This is what he and the Government that has him there as a Minister are going to do to the people of rural Ireland. I am sad it has come to this. I have tabled an amendment and I will move it when the opportunity arises. This is the most hurtful and serious issue. There has been a lot of talk since I came up here about rural Ireland, but it is only lipservice because everything the Government does hurts the people in rural Ireland. Whether the Government realises it or not, that is what it is doing. It is hurting the people in rural Ireland and the grand people in Lauragh, the Black Valley, Glencar and Knocknagoshel. Let every man talk for his own county and I will talk for mine. This is what the Government is doing to the people. It is hurtful and I can tell the Minister, because the people will tell him themselves, they hate him down there and they will never forget what he is doing to them.	spk_408
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-04-24	dail	32	Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017: Report Stage	dbsect_33	I reiterate I am vehemently opposed to the Bill in its entirety and to the additional proposal regarding learner drivers. A couple of weeks ago, the Government made much ado about the lack of teachers. Students who are going to college, whether they are in Kilgarvan, the Black Valley, Cahirciveen or wherever else, have to undertake teacher training in different schools around their areas. Many of them are in university in Cork. They go there for a few hours and then go home to Macroom, Bandon or Killarney to finish the rest of the day. Can the Minister visualise how that is going to work? Who is going to travel with them? Someone will have to drive these students to college in Cork, stay with them there for two hours and bring them back home again. That simply will not work. The Minister will ask me why these students do not have licences. They cannot get a provisional licence until they are 17 years of age. There is then a 22-week wait to do their tests. That is half a year. That is the truth and these are the facts. How are young people from Lauragh, Knocknagoshel, Gneeveguilla, Rathmore or Scartaglen going to manage? It just will not work. It is different in Cork or Dublin where there is a completely different way of life. I am sorry the Minister does not understand and does not want to understand. I believe that every young person deserves to get the same chance as everyone else but because of this legislation, young people will be further isolated. They will not be able to go their apprenticeships or attend colleges and their whole education will be affected. Young people of 17 or 18 years of age cannot ask their father to drive them around the county because everyone has his or her own job to do, be it milking cows, teaching or whatever else. In rural Ireland, in places like Kerry, one cannot travel without a car.  The elderly are also angered by this Bill. Many people around the country are greatly angered by what the Minister is doing, and are asking what they did wrong. They do not believe they ever did anything to the Minister and are wondering whether he is trying to make a name for himself with this Bill. The Minister has not shown that people with 50 mg to 80 mg of alcohol in their blood while driving are the cause of fatalities or accidents. I certainly do not condone drunk-driving but a pint and a half pint never made anybody drunk. That is the truth. There is a lot of talk at the moment about hard and soft borders. The facts are that in the Six Counties, the limit is 80 mg, not 50 mg. One is not put off the road until there is 80 mg of alcohol in one's blood. In France the limit is 80 mg and if one is caught with a lower level than that, one is just fined; one is not put off the road and there are no penalty points.  Why are the people in Kerry and other rural places being scapegoated? Why is the Minister trying to criminalise them? They are hard-working people. There has been much talk about water and housing. These people just want to be left alone. It is harder and harder to get planning permission. Most people in rural Kerry have their own septic tanks and their own water supply. They are really asking for nothing except to be left alone. So much lipservice has been paid, since I have been a Member of this House, about what will be done for rural Ireland. Everything that is being done is hurting the people of rural Ireland. Why will the Minister not just leave them alone? I am begging him to leave them alone. I cannot understand how Fine Gael gave the Minister liberty to do this. That party, for almost 100 years, has gone in and out of rural countryside places such as Rathmore, Kenmare, the Black Valley and the Pocket in Glanmore, and people have voted for it in those places. It is now turning its back on those people and giving the Minister the power to put forward this Bill and to isolate them further.  The people in rural Ireland do not break the law. When this law is brought forward they will only have one thing to do; stay at home. They will not be able to socialise. They will not be able to go out to their local pub to have a pint and a half pint in the way they have been doing. I know a man of 93 years of age, and he has his pint and his half pint - at the very most two pints - and he has never been over the 80 mg limit. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has said, discretion was allowed. That man is 93 years of age but the minute this Bill is enacted, that man will be at home for the rest of his days because he will know that at the 50 mg level he will not be able to have a pint. That is the effect this Bill will have on such a man and many more like him, those who have worked tirelessly to put this country together. Those people had to do things that we do not understand. I do not understand what they did, and I am certain the Minister does not understand what they did or how they managed to keep going and keep the country going. We are here because of people like that man and many more who have gone. That is how we came to be here. I again call on the Minister to reconsider what he is doing. In Dublin, there are plenty of DARTs, buses and taxis but places like Sneem, Waterville or Caherdaniel do not have taxis. There is some service on a Saturday night to take the young people to the local disco. That is all they have, and there is nothing left to enable the elderly or middle-aged people to go out to the rural pubs. It is sad to think that while many rural pubs have closed, hundreds more will do so once this Bill is brought forward.  I am disappointed to note that not enough Deputies stood up to allow us to have a vote. At other times, we have stood up at with other parties just to give them the privilege and the chance to have a vote. We were not allowed that chance tonight and I regret it. I know that many of the those who were present would have liked to stand. I do not know who stopped them. I believe that when a Member is elected to this House, there is only one priority, namely, the people who vote for him or her. Many of the Deputies here have let their own people down. However, that is their business and I will not name them or anything like that. I am very disappointed that we did not have a vote tonight because this is a most serious issue. It is going to hurt County Kerry in a desperate way because by and large, it is a rural county and one cannot manage without a car. People realise that when this measure comes in, if they go out, have a pint and a half and are caught, they will lose their licence. That means they will lose their job, which means they lose everything. It could mean they lose their home. This is shameless carry-on. I am hurt and I am praying that somehow, something will happen that will stop this from going through. The Minister seems to have the numbers. Fine Gael is backing him just because he is holding that party's Government together. It is a shame that Fine Gael has allowed the Minister to do this because many of its members do not agree with this measure either. What the Minister is doing is needless. He is hurting many people in rural Ireland and I am very sad and angry about it.	spk_440

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-04-18	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_16	In recent times, the Government has made much ado about encouraging emigrants to come home and work in the teaching, nursing and social work professions. If such people have been out of the country for more than three of the past five years, they cannot access postgraduate courses without paying for them. A girl of whom I am aware left Killarney in 2014 at the age of 24. She came back last June and wishes to access a course in Trinity College Dublin which should cost €6,300 but, because she was away for three of the past five years, will cost her €11,600. She has spent 24 and a half years of her life in this country. Why is a limit being put on her such that she must be in the country for the past three years? Is this rule intended to apply to immigrants from other countries? It should not apply to people who were bred, born and reared in our country and who spent the most part of their lives here and will not even be able to access a SUSI grant.	spk_186

The Taoiseach may be involved in some way in the weather forecasting and maybe he knows more than I do, but the fact is that if it dried today it would take two to three weeks before land would dry so that a farmer could leave cattle out.Cattle are hungry. Cows are hungry. Lambs are perishing. Farmers' minds are being tested to the limit. Will the Taoiseach and his Government subsidise meals and rations and give farmers some sort of subsidy?

I thank Deputy McConalogue for bringing forward this very important motion, which contains very laudable elements. I will not get around in a minute and a half to all of them. I ask the Minister to provide a subsidy for farmers in order to provide meal. I ask the Minister to pay farmers all the grants they are owed. Many of these are not being paid at all and farmers are being fined for different things. They are struggling and their minds are gone. I ask the Minister to pay farmers in real trouble in advance so as to ensure they can continue in farming. This is a crisis and their backs are to the wall. The Minister and the Government must do something about this. The Minister gave back €106 million to the Exchequer in 2016 and over €70 million last year. The Minister should not give back a penny this year and give it instead to the farmers out there in Kerry and west Cork. There is only a distance of 20 miles between us. The Minister knows those farmers are in trouble and he should do something about it. I am asking the Minister again about this. He should not forget those farmers as he is the Minister now.	spk_397

I do not believe, however, there is much point in debating this issue here now because the decision has been made to expel a diplomat from the Russian Embassy. I wonder how the Government decided on one person. Were all the names put into a hat and one fellow pulled out? How long will the termination last? Will Ireland's neutrality be affected? That is the big question being asked by all the people I meet, and rightfully so. Churchill put it up to Ireland when things were very serious in the Second World War but we are all still thankful to Éamon de Valera who kept Ireland neutral in that war. We have a lot to be thankful for in him doing that. The decision was made this morning to expel this diplomat and we are talking about it this evening. I wonder if the House would be better off talking about the trolley crisis given the still enormous number of people who are left on trolleys in hospitals day after day. I believe there were 27 people on trolleys yesterday in Kerry General Hospital. We trade in different ways with Russia so will this move affect trade? Will it anger them in such a way that we may be opening ourselves to some form of attack along the line? Will they expel Irish diplomats from Russia? Maybe these are the issues about which the Government, the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the Ministers in the Cabinet know more than we do. In fairness, however, it seems a hasty decision. Could it not have taken longer? If there was proof or more open proof, maybe we would not be as worried. The UK is about to leave the European Union and it wants to leave.It is very close to us and is hurt by this attack. If the shoe was on the other foot, however, would it do the same for us? Would other countries do the same for us? I hope, now that the Government has made this decision, that definite proof will be provided to show that the Russians carried out this atrocious attack. We have made a very serious decision to expel a Russian diplomat from Dublin. I hope that it will not have adverse implications for our country.	spk_333

The Minister of State visited St. Mary of the Angels in Kerry and saw at first hand the great work which was being done there. Sadly, no new children are being admitted to the centre.While no one is currently being moved, there is concern that people will be moved. I am calling for an independent assessment of how people moved to the congregated settings are getting on, whether in Kerry, Cork or anywhere else in the country, because for two people in Kerry it has not worked out. A few weeks ago I raised the case of a person who had been in St. Mary of the Angels for years and was moved to a congregated setting. At that time, this man was deaf and dumb but able to communicate through sign language. Owing to an overdose of anti-psychotic drugs in June last year, he is now also blind. He might as well be dead. His family are outraged. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, said previously that nobody would be moved without the agreement of the family. This family were told three years ago that he had no other choice but to move because he was well enough to do so. I previously called for an independent investigation into this case but I have had no response yet. The family is waiting for a response. This is a serious matter. While previously this man could communicate, he is now deaf, dumb and blind. I cannot mention another person because were I to do so, that person's identity would be known. I am calling for an independent assessment of how people moved to congregated settings are managing. There is no respite and mothers are worn out. There are many people trying to get into St. Mary of the Angels. There is no other place for these children. Families are worn out and broken from trying to manage. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to investigate this matter and to allow fair process be applied to these people.	spk_381

Brexit is a major concern in my constituency, especially among those living in rural parts of County Kerry who depend on farming. Small business owners are also worried about what will become of them after Brexit. Significant expectations were created before Christmas with regard to the border with the North. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade suggested the matter had been sorted out and that there would not be a hard border. People are not sure what happened and whether it was Britain or the European Union which had sold the story to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste because they surely did not make it up for us. Brexit is of critical importance and we need to find out how it will materialise. We certainly do not want to return to the days of a hard border. Many people are sad that the Border was not mentioned in the recent talks between the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, and the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk. The way in which the Border issue will be addressed has been left to very late in the day. That is the big question and I ask the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to do everything possible to ensure we will not end up with a hard border. It is difficult to see how it can be avoided. However, given that we were told before Christmas that we would not have a hard border, I ask the Government to ensure we have will a soft border. As I stated, it is of critical importance to small farmers and small businesses who deal with people in the North that Brexit not affect or hurt them.	spk_262

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-03-20	dail	32	Strategic Communications Unit: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this motion. It is not fair especially to smaller parties and Independents. It is a blatant attempt by the Government's party to boost its chances of retaining power and increasing power at the next election. The spin in the 2040 document and the announcement in Sligo at which the Government had all its candidates from the neighbouring constituencies out front was a blatant attempt to drive other small parties and Independents into the ground. Shame on the Government for trying that stunt. In the long term, it will hurt the Government. Perhaps it is too blind to see that at present. I will remind the Minister what was written in that 2040 plan, which there was so much talk about, in very small writing. It said planning in rural areas will be allowed if it does not distract from larger towns and cities. That is what the Government proposes to do in the plan. It needs to be highlighted for the people out there in rural places who always built and paid for their own houses. That is in the 2040 plan. There is a lot of talk and spin here about reports and strategies to build houses for people. These people wanted nothing but planning to be allowed to build the houses for themselves. They will not be allowed to do that. Before the Government gets away with it, there will be many other battles here, there and everywhere because it is people's democratic right to build a house for themselves. The €5 million for the spin machine would help to provide more beds for people in places like Kerry General Hospital where there are 30 or 40 people on trolleys every day even at this time of year. They are the things we need to address. The 2040 plan left a whole lot of rural Ireland out, including rural parts of Kerry. There was no mention of any town or village in it. I am very sorry but the truth is the truth and that is what I have to tell the Government.	spk_173
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-03-20	dail	32	Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_10	I wish to reiterate my firm belief that life begins when a baby begins to grow inside a woman. It is a crime to take a life. Let us go back to what abortion is. People should educate themselves that abortion is stopping the right of a little baby to live or continue its journey into this life from the mother's womb. I was absolutely disgusted and so upset when I heard the way it is done, with two injections, first one to paralyse the little baby and then another to stop his heartbeat and stop his life, and not give him the chance to live. That is terrible because life is a gift and a treasure. The babies that are born around the world tonight are our future; they are the world ahead of us. Once a baby is conceived, it has a right to live. Everyone around the country, in this Chamber, at the Oireachtas committee and at the Citizens' Assembly, which was not elected by anyone and the membership of which was, I believe, selectively chosen, has had his or her say. The little unborn babies will not be able to say a word. That is where I have a serious difficulty, and nothing will ever change my mind. It is my duty, as an elected Member, to speak for them and to cite their right to continue their journey into this world. No one in this world has the right to take the life of another. There has been a lot of talk about babies throughout the country. Whether it is a growing child, a mother, a father or anyone else - even an elderly man living in the countryside who is killed by some blackguards - that is wrong, and it is wrong to take the life of an unborn baby. Only God decides when a life should end, and it is a good job it is that way. Girls and women should have access to support. If they become pregnant and are despairing or in bother, they should receive help. They should receive plenty of counselling, financial support and whatever else. If they cannot manage, there are plenty of couples who would gladly adopt and cherish a little baby boy or girl if they were given the chance to do so. There is a great deal more available to women today than there was 50 years ago, when girls were frowned upon when they became pregnant out of wedlock. That is not the position today. There is contraception and so much education available, and rightly so. There is fierce respect for women and girls who become pregnant in today's world, which is wonderful. Life is a gift. I appreciate life and I will do so while there is a breath left in my body. Little unborn babies have the right to continue their journey into life. The eighth amendment has served mothers and babies very well for the past 35 years. The referendum proposes to allow abortion on demand up to 12 weeks and, in other cases, may allow it up to 19 or 20 weeks. The referendum proposes to get rid of the eighth amendment but no other wording is being put in place to either protect the mother or the unborn baby. That we would leave it up to the Members of this Dáil or future Dáileanna is my major worry as I see so many Deputies in this Chamber supporting abortion. The small unborn baby making its way into this world will not stand a chance. I am asking all the good people throughout the country to remember the unborn baby, as we all once were, and to vote against the proposal to get rid of the eighth amendment, which has protected mothers and unborn babies for the past 35 years. The Supreme Court ruled that the unborn baby has a constitutional right to life but does not have the right to life before it is born. What it is saying is that the unborn baby does not have the right to remain within the protection of the womb. To me, that is very contradictory and hard to understand. As I have said before, I am against allowing abortion of a little baby who has reached 12 weeks in a mother's womb. A baby at that stage is very well formed and has a heartbeat, a brain, a head, arms and legs. We all know that and no one should try to deny it. This baby cannot ask to be let live while everyone else can express a view. We have to remember the small unborn baby has done nothing wrong. In all the debates that have taken place in recent years, there has been very little mention of the negative effective an abortion has had on many mothers. Once that little baby is gone, while the mother may have other babies, she will never forget the one she does not have.I reject the idea proposed by some Deputies that parents should be allowed to have an abortion because they are not able to support and rear another baby. God help us, is that where we have got to now? What about all of the contraceptive methods and morning after pills? The last thing we should be talking about is getting rid of the little unborn baby.	spk_249

If a mother is in trouble, why can she not get help and seek to have her baby adopted by such people? Many couples would love to adopt a baby. What about the lovely, big families that were reared around my neck of the woods? There were 22 Cahills, 17 Lovetts and 15 O'Connors who are still around. They were fine boys and girls. There were also 16 O'Sullivans. I know of a girl who has arrived in our neck of the woods from another county. She is very welcome. There were 22 in her family. She told me of how their father took them to school in a cattle box tied onto a Ford 3000 tractor. At one point, 14 of them were going to the local primary school at the same time. Such families did not have the dole or social welfare and the children helped their parents to rear one another. None of them starved or perished from the cold. While we rightly criticise the Government for many failings, it is not legitimate to propagate abortion because the Government is failing in terms of housing, health and other services. However, some Members have the ridiculous idea of suggesting that the Government not providing services is the reason babies should be aborted. I named a number of families, but there are none like them anymore. Families with four, five or six children are considered large these days. To everyone who will vote in the referendum, what is being proposed here is to get rid of the eighth amendment and allow for the abortion of babies up to 12 weeks gestation. There are many good people out there and a lot of them have been contacting me in recent months. They are appalled by the suggestion that unborn babies of up to 12 weeks gestation should be aborted. Maybe the Government is not in the real world or does not understand this, but they are rightly appalled. I ask people to reject this referendum out of hand. There will never be a second chance. As sure as day follows night, the 12 weeks will be increased to 19 weeks or maybe 25 weeks. What if someone like Hillary Clinton came along and got power in these Chambers? She said that it would be fine to abort babies up to eight and a half months.	spk_251

Whatever about President Trump - there is much criticism of him outside his country and many people are in favour of him in his country - it is a good job that someone like her did not get power, given how she propagated something like that. It was horrible and outrageous. I was listening to the radio one evening recently when the Minister, Deputy Harris, stated that it was terrible to think of a mother coming home from abroad with her loved one in the boot of the car. I do not know what he meant by it, but the little dead baby did not feel very loved. It would not have made a difference if the baby was in the boot of the car in London, the North or the South - the unborn baby was dead at that stage. I was very hurt when I heard the Minister saying something like that. If abortion is introduced, it will increase the number of abortions in our country. It will mean that most children with Down's syndrome or disabilities will be aborted.	spk_253

If this referendum goes through, which I hope it does not, we will see in a short time who is right and who is wrong. The Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas committee seemed to have one aim and one aim only on this issue, that being to recommend a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment as soon as possible. Throughout the process, they ignored anything and anyone who would get in the way of that. One must wonder why they ignored anyone who was in favour of the eighth amendment. Of what were they afraid? Perhaps they were afraid to put it on the record that, after 22 days, the little baby's heart is beating, the baby's brain is forming at six weeks, and the baby can be seen on ultrasound sucking its thumb at 12 weeks. Perhaps they were afraid to put it on the record that one in five pregnancies in England ended in abortion. Perhaps they were afraid to put it on the record that 90% of babies diagnosed in the womb with Down's syndrome were aborted. If we are going to be afraid of anything in this debate, we should be afraid that the elected representatives in the House and the media are hiding these facts from the people in order to push through the repeal of the eighth amendment. This is what repeal will lead to. There is no mystery about the lives that have been saved by the eighth amendment. We all know who they are. We all know people who got pregnant but took some time to get used to the idea of being parents. Maybe they thought about travelling for an abortion but, because it was not easily available in Ireland, they had enough time to think about it some more, change their minds and have their baby instead of an abortion. I will not be voting to repeal the eighth amendment - I will vote to retain it. I have held this view for a long time. If I as someone who has been elected by the people of Kerry to represent them in the Thirty-second Dáil did not seek to protect the life of a small, unborn baby, I would not be worth much. I forgot to mention a point. We were invited across the road to Buswell's Hotel approximately 12 months ago. A 39 year old lady from the USA told us her story. Her mother was forced to have an abortion by her grandmother.One way or another, the abortion took place but she lived. She attended a meeting across the road and told her story. She was 39 years of age at that stage; she must be 40 now. Life is precious. When we see something like that happening, we realise the situation. There was nothing wrong with that woman. At that stage when she was an unborn baby, she had done nothing wrong. I am glad she lived and came over here to tell us her story. I worry about all the others who did not make it. I hope our country will reject the repeal of the eighth amendment and that it will be retained to protect the unborn baby and the mother.	spk_259

I welcome Mr. Pat Connolly and his concerned friends and neighbours to the Visitors Gallery for this important debate. They came all the way from Bantry. The motion suggests the prioritisation of traditional harvesters, exemptions for traditional harvesters harvesting under a certain amount and the protection of traditional harvesting rights from commercial interests in the future. The Minister of State said he wants the big harvesters as well as the traditional harvesters. He cannot have both because he is trying to carry two sides of the road but anyone whoever tried to do that finished up in the middle of nowhere. He will fall between two stools. There is only one way here and that is to protect the traditional small farmers who are also small fishermen. The Minister of State knows what this will do. Granting a licence to rip the guts out of Bantry Bay will cause coastal erosion, and it will cause trouble for tourism and fishing, and for small farmers and small fishermen. I ask him to revoke the licence and not to carry on with this lunacy. I also ask Fianna Fáil, which is supporting and propping up the Government parties, to put it up to them to change this racket that they are at and to revoke the licence because this is a serious matter. We need fair trade, we need fair play and I ask the Government to revoke the licence and not to do anything like this in the future. Bantry harbour is only 20 miles from Kilgarvan.	spk_369

I thank the Green Party and the Social Democrats for bringing the motion forward. Increasing supply is the key to getting us out of the rut we are in. I do not agree with people who say that it should be the responsibility of only the local authority or the public sector to build houses. The private sector has a role to play as well and it should be supported in that. Everything has been thrown at the sector. It is difficult to get planning permission or finance. Its margins have been cut and it is regulated extensively. These issues should be looked at so that the sector has a level playing field.The tendering system is slowing down the building of houses for local authorities. It was much better before as they had a list system where they had their own builders who built so many houses. It seemed to happen a lot faster. We have a lot more equipment now. We have more diggers and teleporters and different types of scaffolding, so no one can understand why it is taking so long to build so few houses. On the cost of rent, this week has been terrible for those living in my neck of the woods. Girls with two and three children were bawling crying because they must leave their houses as they are being sold. They do not know where they will go. One girl, who has split up with her partner, has not seen her daughter for a number of weeks because she is in bed and breakfast accommodation and cannot get social housing to bring her little girl to visit her. It would drive one down to the ground to hear them crying and upset. Life is short and the least people deserve is a home. Rents have increased to €1,200 and €1,400 per month in Killarney. This week, one girl was quoted €2,000 per month for a house in a certain part of the surrounds of Killarney. People just cannot afford those rents. They are in receipt of social welfare such as lone parent's allowance and whatever other little bits they get. The cap on the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme in Kerry is €575. People are therefore in a desperate state. Tenants should be asked to pay so much but, if the Government wants to reduce the rent, the tax that landlords pay on the rent received for houses should be reduced across the board. I have said it in the House a few times before. It might get things moving a bit. I apologise to Deputy Mattie McGrath for taking some of his time.	spk_401

It is sad that even if a person or family has struck a deal with a bank the bank can decide that it does not want to deal with that person any longer and thus the family or the individual has to leave their home. It does not seem right that these financial institutions are allowed to sell off loans to vulture funds that are in no way connected to this State. By way of example, I know of a couple who owed €350,000 but were unable to make the repayments on it. They were in fear of losing their home but nevertheless they remained in the home for some time. Eventually, the loan was sold to a vulture fund. The family came by money and offered to repay what they owed but the vulture fund would not accept their offer. It wanted a repayment equal to double the amount of what was owed. That is the truth. The Government and the Minister have the power to put in place laws to prevent these foreign financial institutions doing what they are doing here for profit, thus causing misery to our people. As I have previously stated, where families experience difficulty repaying their loans the local authorities should be funded to buy their loans from the mortgage holders and to allow the families remain in those homes as tenants, with an opportunity to buy back the house in the future if they get back on their feet. We should be doing that rather than allowing mortgages to be sold to foreign vulture funds. The Irish people will not be happy with this Government if it allows Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank to sell off their loans to vulture funds. As I said, the Government and the Minister have the power to stop that happening. They need to legislate to prevent the sale of mortgages by Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank to vulture funds. I have been contacted by numerous people over the last couple of weeks who are terrified of this happening. Now is the time for the Government and the Minister to take a stand and to legislate to prevent this happening. It should have not happened before but we cannot go backwards. I am pleading with the Minister to not allow this to happen. 	spk_422

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-02-27	dail	32	Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_33	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this important Bill. When this Bill started off, people were looking to curtail binge drinking and provide for minimum unit pricing. Those were the objectives, but the Bill has strayed now. To be honest, it has gone haywire. The notion of introducing a cancer warning label that would cover one third of the packaging of alcohol products was added to the legislation before Christmas. I have nothing personal against the Minister of State - I have nothing at all to say to her - but I wonder whether those who make such proposals really know what they are talking about. Small distilleries and little brewing companies around the country are employing people. They are giving good employment and competing on the world market with Scotch whisky and other different whiskeys from around the world that do not need to have these cancer labels. I am pro-jobs. I do not intend to support this Bill because it will hurt people who are employed in parts of County Kerry like Killarney and Dingle, where they are doing great work. I believe these measures will do more harm than good. No other country in the world has introduced mandatory cancer warnings on alcohol products. We really needed to see if we could reduce binge drinking and reduce the minimum pricing.However, this is not being done. If we go back 20 or 25 years, young fellows used to go to a bar with older brothers, parents or uncles and were trained how to drink two or maybe three pints. They enjoyed the banter and communication with people from the parish or locality. This no longer happens because young people now drink on one or possibly two nights at the weekend. It was different in the past because the same closing time applied to all licensed premises. Nowadays, later closing times apply to a small number of venues in cities and large towns where youngsters and inclined to go for a late drink. They are not among their own, however, and meet many different people who they do not know. They are losing out because going out is now an anonymous activity, whereas in the past people went out for the banter and to talk about football or what was going on in the locality or on the local farms. I do not know how we can get back to that but if we were try to do so, we might achieve something.  The Bill is being proposed when the Irish beer and whiskey sectors are experiencing a period of promising growth. They stuck with it for the past eight or nine years and survived. Now that they are coming out the other end, they are about to be blown out of existence by the proposed cancer warnings on alcohol product labels. We have a great distillery in Dingle and the Killarney Brewing Company on the Muckross Road. The brewery's visitor centre attracts tourists every day during the summer and is an attraction for the town. This Bill will hurt companies such as this. How can producers compete with producers from countries such as Scotland where cancer warnings are not required on labels for Scotch whisky? A requirement to place cancer warnings on alcohol product labels will have a damaging impact on small distilleries and breweries that are bringing new products to the market. The notion that producers should be required to produce a label for the Irish market only will create additional costs for them, particularly small craft brewers and whiskey distillers. If they are in a position to export, they will have to produce one label for Ireland and another for the rest of the world. Redesigning labels has associated costs which will add yet more to the costs incurred by small drinks companies that support and create local jobs. We must remember that Friday evening does not take long coming for people who have staff to pay. I know what it is like to be an employer because I have been employing people for years. Friday evening comes very fast.  Will the cancer warning labels work? It is worth considering whether the introduction of such labels will solve our problems with harmful and underage drinking. We must also balance this with the harm they will do to the industry. I do not believe they will have any effect on young people because they will soon find out that the product is the same as it was before the label was placed on it. The measure will hurt exporters, however. Focusing on only one health issue is confusing for consumers. I suggest the Department of Health rolls out an education campaign informing people of the recommended drinking guidelines, rather than placing cancer warnings on bottles because the measure is unlikely to work. If we removed alcohol completely, people would turn to something else. They are already turning to drugs. I wonder if cancer labels are put on drugs in the places they come from. The Bill will introduce new rules on alcohol advertisements, including where they can be shown, which is a ridiculous provision. If people know a bottle of whiskey or wine is behind a curtain in a shop, it will not make a difference but it will harm small shops because they will have to implement the measure in the small space available to them. The proposed measures will prevent alcohol companies from including a storyline in advertisements. This is too strict and will negatively impact the drinks industry. It means small producers will not be able to gain market share or grow to a sufficient size to export their products. The advertising restrictions will also make it more difficult for new entrants to bring products to the Irish market. Evidence shows that these restrictions will cost Irish media €20 million per annum in lost revenue. I feel for the businesses that are providing jobs. Visitor centres attached to whiskey distilleries are an attraction. I am particularly concerned that the Bill spells trouble for Irish whiskey tourism. The new measures will impact on advertisements for whiskey distillery visitor centres that contain the name of the brand. Visitor centre advertisements will not be allowed to contain images of people or use storylines. Advertisements will be prohibited from train stations and bus stops and from within 200 m of schools and crèches. I ask the Minister to give special consideration to the impact of the Bill on visitor centres. I am worried about businesses that are trying to get off the ground and those that have stuck it out for the past eight or nine years and are trying to provide jobs. The Bill has strayed from its original purpose. It has gone off the rails altogether and is losing support for that reason. We all want to tackle the problems of harmful and underage drinking but extreme legislation is not always good legislation. I ask the Minister to consider the points I have raised and identify what small changes could be made to the Bill to address these concerns. Nobody is interested in scuppering the legislation. The issue is one of making sensible changes that will create balance. For this reason, I ask the Minister to revisit the Bill. If the Government were to stick to the original intention of introducing minimum pricing and if it tried to address the issue of teenagers being lured into a small number of large, open venues, we would achieve a better outcome.	spk_413

The first group of young drivers are discriminated against to the extent that it is almost impossible for them to go on the road now with the cost of insurance, even with a full licence. Indeed for those with only a provisional licence there is a Minister here saying they should not be on the road at all and that the people who own the cars should be put in jail. However, he does not have to live in rural Ireland. It must be recognised that youngsters need their cars to go to college. The other day we were talking about providing teachers. Youngsters need their car to go to college and then to the school where they do work experience and to travel back home again. In some cases it can be over 100 miles per day. How can they do this without a car? We have to be realistic. They cannot get insurance. They are being charged €3,500, €4,000 or maybe €4,500 for insurance, which is wrong. It is wrong for any Minister to say in this Chamber that insurance premiums have reduced by 17% because they have not. They clearly and most definitely have not. I was talking to people who rang me a while ago.They have gone up, year by year, over the past three years. The Minister of State should get out of the bubble he is in. He is in a bubble if he thinks premiums have gone down by 17%. Old people's insurance has doubled in the past three years. It has doubled and that is a fact. Taxi operators in Killarney and Tralee tell me that their insurance has gone up to three times its original amount in the past two years. That is a fact. Only two insurance companies quote them for insurance. That is wrong. Those people are being militated against and find it very hard to continue. It is the same story with road hauliers. Insurance goes up, on top of all the regulation, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and all the other carry-on, such as checkpoints. Even perfectly new vehicles that are only barely on the road are checked out and sent off to garages. On top of that, the cost of insurance is going up. We have instances of claims where the sum received for whiplash in England is £7,600. Those sums are anything from €19,000 to €77,000 in Ireland. We have the brass necks but they must have gold necks in Ireland to be able to get that amount of compensation.	spk_450

There are solicitors who are looking for people to claim. They are saying they got so much for one person and will get the same for another person. They are advertising. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, only deals with 20% of claims. It should be dealing with all the claims but is not. Why is that? The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, who was present earlier, said this committee or whatever has been set up has had a positive effect. He said it is not a matter for the Minister or the Central Bank to interfere in the process whereby insurers state they will not insure cars of over ten years of age. Who is in government? Who is in power? Who will rectify this matter? If a car has passed its NCT - a ten to 12-year-old car might not have 20,000 km on it and will pass the test - and the insurance company will not insure it, surely there is some power to do something about that?	spk_452

This policy of stating it will not do anything is wrong, as someone must. People's cars are passing the NCT and they still are not allowed on the road. Why is that? Then there is the age limit, whereby insurance companies claim drivers do not have enough experience and either increase the cost or may not give those drivers any cover. Surely the Minister of State has something to do about that? If he does not, I do not know how the country is going to be put in place. If the Government and the Minister for Finance do not have the ability or wherewithal to deal with these problems, where are we going?	spk_454

Government Deputies are in here propagating that they are going to do this and do that. There is one report after another to deal with homelessness and to build houses.

This proposed scheme has been talked about for the past 18 years or so but, sadly, it has not been built to date. This very important scheme is to cater for two housing estates of over 100 houses, two pubs, a GAA pitch, a shop, a post office-----	spk_165

Its plans are being held up. There are many houses along the route. The purpose of the scheme is to take the sewage from Kilcummin down to the Killarney treatment plant, which is operating at just 56% of capacity and so would be well capable of coping. There are 750 people in the village catchment, approximately 250 houses and up to 100 more along the route. Inland Fisheries Ireland took the matter to An Board Pleanála and, happily, planning permission has come through. The history of this is that funding was made available in 2008. Contracts were in place at that time but the contractor was removed because of things that happened on another scheme with which he was involved. The Department of Finance then stipulated the use of a new type of tender whereby would-be contractors would have to tender an all-in price. This created difficulties for the local authority and delayed the tender process. Before we knew where we were, the country and the scheme both went down the Swanee. We have been fighting for the scheme ever since. The state of the road where the sewerage pipe is to be laid is causing the people of Kilcummin much distress. It was to have been resurfaced in 2004 and there was money for that. However, this was put back until the sewerage scheme project was carried out. Year after year, we have had money for the road but it is still in a shocking state. Every councillor - myself, when I was on the council, my daughter Maura, who has been there since, and all the other elected representatives in the area - has had deputations in about the state of the road. The people of Kilcummin are entitled to good road up to their doors in the very same way as the people in Dublin 4. We are now informed that maybe it will go ahead next year. I am asking the Government to ensure that this scheme is progressed next year, to liaise with Irish Water and to ensure that the people of Kilcummin get what they are entitled to.	spk_168

However, that scheme only applies to larger towns, such as Killarney, Tralee and Dingle in Kerry. Rural villages and parishes are left behind, many of which contain houses that are lying idle and would provide grand shelter for the elderly or homeless. However, the repair and leasing scheme does not extend to those rural areas, although the Minister has previously contradicted me in the House when I have raised this issue. The repair and leasing scheme does not extend to rural villages, towns or the wider rural area, even where there are several houses which a small bit of work would make fit for habitation.	spk_223
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-02-21	dail	32	Project Ireland 2040: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_36	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about this proposed plan, and I hope it is only a proposed plan. First, anything I say to the Minister of State is not personal; it is purely based on the plan and its architects. We were told that the purpose of this plan was to take people out of Dublin and build up the rural part of the country. We were told also that it would benefit cities such as Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway but, as I see it, this is another Dublin plan. There is very little in it for any other part of the country. I will read it again, but I did not see Kerry mentioned in the plan once. That is what we have to put up with. The people of Kerry and the people of rural Ireland are entitled to live the best way they can and where they want to live. No one can make them live anywhere else against their will. It is hard to highlight everything in the plan but there are different proposals and strategies in it. Page 92 refers to the location of homes. It states that future homes are required to be located where people have the best opportunities to access a high standard quality of life. It further states that they are to be located in places that can support sustainable development. Where are those places? It further states that places which support growth, innovation and the efficient provision of infrastructure and are accessible to a range of local services can encourage the use of public transport, walking, cycling and help tackle climate change. The plan also refers to requirements to live in our cities and larger towns. We have to be very careful when we see this because planners will be told how to interpret it. It refers to areas where large-scale housing demand exists and where homes and appropriate supporting services can be delivered more efficiently and effectively at less cost to the State in the long run and still be located in our smaller towns, villages and rural areas including the countryside, but at an appropriate scale, that does not detract from the capacity of our larger towns and cities to deliver homes more sustainably. We are keeping our ear to the ground and we have been told that the new plan will direct local authorities to suggest that one-off houses cannot be built in rural areas other than when and where towns and villages are sufficiently built up. When will that happen? That is the trouble. John Moran had a role in the Central Bank. It is no wonder the country went the way it did. When a fellow with a mind like his was involved, it is no wonder the thing went wallop. He says that-----	spk_498

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-02-21	dail	32	Project Ireland 2040: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_36	These people have an idea that rural Ireland is a burden on the State. They complained about 500,000 one-off houses being built around the country. I want to say to those people that all those houses had to go through the rigorous planning process before planning permission was granted. They had to comply with site assessment and septic tank requirements. They could not be obtrusive in terms of the countryside, they had to have the required sight distance going out on roads, and, by and large, they had to be connected to the area in which they wanted to build. Those people did nothing wrong when they put a roof over their own heads. If the Government is proposing to stop people doing that, there will be crowds outside the gate of these Houses. They have been there in the past but there will be a bigger crowd outside the gate if it tries to do something like that to people who are not doing any harm. There is a lot of talk here about the need for local authorities to build houses for homeless people. That has to be done in certain cases, but where people can and want to build a house in which to bring up their families the way they want to and not have to experience the social problems they may experience if they were in more built-up areas, I cannot see anything wrong with that. These people are saying there will have to be a financial need for them to be allowed build a house in a rural area. That is totally wrong and is the height of blackguarding because most people in rural Ireland are trying to live the best way they can off their bit of land, but they have to travel to work and I do not see anything wrong with that. They are saying that these people are costing the State in terms of infrastructure. Most of them have their own septic tanks and no one should tell me that the roads have to be maintained for them. Those are the same roads used since the time of the horse and carts in the 1800s. We battled to get them resurfaced, so surely they are entitled to that. What about the urban cost? There is no talk about that. All we hear is the burden rural Ireland is on the State. Dublin has trains, buses, the DART, the Luas, the metro, and another terminal built in Dublin Airport, yet one would get lonely in Shannon Airport now.	spk_504

It is aggravating to say the least. This Government could not plan for three or four years never mind 22. That this plan will be sacrosanct and statutory and that it may be impossible to add anything or take it away if it is wrong is against my principles. Climate change is going to cost €22 billion or at least €22 billion will be provided for it. Who will provide that? It will, of course, be the people. At that rate of going, it will cost €1 billion a year to comply. We are told we will not be allowed to cut turf by 2030. The words used were to the effect that we cannot burn peat. We were told we would be better off to leave the turf in the bog but a lot of people in Gneevgullia, Kilcummin, Kilgarvan, Caherciveen, Killorglin and all the areas in between would be very cold if they were not allowed go to the bog, cut their turf and bring it home. There will be serious repercussions if the Government tries to implement that. On the Paris Agreement, every law and rule has to apply to Ireland but there is no talk at all about Japan where they cannot see one another with the smog. They have masks on their faces. It is the same in China. We find that all the grand tractors and lorries we had have all gone now to Third World countries like India where they are working fine. We cannot use them here at all. We must have AdBlue and additional costs and complications. We must have that but the rest of the world can have what was good enough for us ten, 15, 20 or even 30 years ago. In 2006 and 2007, people were told they would have to get diesel cars. In 2012 and 2013, they were told to have AdBlue and comply with climate regulations. My time is running out, but-----	spk_506

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-02-21	dail	32	Supporting the Suckling Sector: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_40	I can tell him there are very good suckler farmers in south and west Kerry and they pride themselves on farming and producing good weanlings. Like everything, the source of the beef is the calf. If the calves are not going to be looked after, we are at a crossroads. I hear the vibes around the circuit that the suckler farmer is finding it very hard to continue and is very likely to cut down numbers or to get out of it altogether. I have no problem in telling the people on the eastern side of the country that the weanlings are coming from the west. They are coming into the mart of the Minister's town of Macroom and into Skibbereen, Kenmare, Milltown and Cahirciveen and that is where the drovers from up the country are getting their beef. If those fellows are not going to be looked after, they will disappear and it will be very hard to get them back because there is an awful lot involved in calving a cow and rearing the calf. Many farmers are experiencing challenges due to the volatility in the market, the difficulty in farming conditions, bad weather and losses. I am a suckler farmer myself. I bought a farm 25 years ago and in ten years I paid off the loan, but if I bought it today, I would not pay off the loan. With the cost of the land and what is being made from calves at present, it would be gone in a couple of years. Some 35 or 36 years ago weanlings were making £700 to £750 but, today, they are making €700 to €750, so there is something wrong. That is the truth. Farmers need this €200 like they never needed it before. The cost of fertiliser and feed are going up every year but the price of the weanlings in the marts is not going up.Something needs to be done to protect them and ensure that they continue because if we do not have the sucklers we will not have the beef down the line. Many of these farmers survive on very marginal farms and conditions. They pride themselves on the stock they produce.	spk_576

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-02-20	dail	32	Dublin Traffic: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_37	"Dublin traffic is a serious problem. I have long asked the cause. The obvious cause is continuous policies by this Government, by past Governments, and if the 2040 plan materialises, it will also be by future Governments. It is because everything revolves around Dublin. Continuous policies have directed investment to ensure that industry and business continue to come to this city. Most likely, when one listens to Kerry radio each morning, the first news headlines at 7 a.m. will announce another hundred or 500 jobs for Dublin, but it is very rare when there is a job directed towards Kerry or the west. Then the story is how we get the traffic into Dublin and out of it. Deputy Cowen spoke about the midlands. We know that the whole midlands are travelling into Dublin each morning. They have to because no jobs at all have been directed towards the midlands. The further west a person goes, the worse the story is. We cannot attract business into our counties because we do not have the infrastructure. We have been fighting for 22 years for the Macroom bypass. It is to be hoped it will materialise. Most of the county still does not have broadband. There is plenty of broadband here. It could be in Kerry, west Cork, or Clare if the people in power were minded to do that. They are hell-bent on doing things for Dublin. Everything has to be Dublin. I do not begrudge the people who live and work here in Dublin but we are asking for fair play down the country. That is all we want. There is to be another runway built for Dublin Airport while at the same time our fine Shannon international airport has been downgraded. It is half empty most times one goes there because the policy of making planes stop there ended. Now it is all Dublin. They can build another runway, it does not matter what it costs. They should build it anyway and bring more people in. The 2040 plan says it will build a metro, extend the Luas, and have more DARTs.I believe the Government gave €135 million for a glorified footpath in Dublin. That is more than we would get for the roads programme for the year in the county of Kerry. God Almighty, is anyone going to stand up and say, ""Stop""? If the Government keeps putting people into this side of the country it will topple into the Irish Sea. It will have to happen. We are depending on the local industries the indigenous people set up. We cannot attract investment into our county. We have failed because we do not have the infrastructure. I am looking at the Minister, Deputy Ross. I am saying I believe we are not getting a fair crack of the whip. Where would we be without Liebherr that has been in Kerry for 60 years, FEXCO in Killorglin, Munster Joinery on the Cork-Kerry border, Michael Cronin Readymix, Seán Murphy KWD, Tricel, O'Carroll Engineering, Walsh Colour Print and Dairymaster? We have a Sneem community group voluntarily fundraising to try to get infrastructure into an old hall in Sneem so that it can provide a few jobs. We are not getting a fair crack of the whip at all. They have to buy this broadband dearly so that they can employ people in that place. I heard one Deputy mention here that there should be more investment in transport to take children to school. Our trouble is we cannot keep the rural schools open because we cannot keep the people at home. This new plan will invest in Cork city and Limerick. There is not one word about Kerry and that is what is wrong. That is why Dublin is choked. Everything is directed at Dublin. Whether it is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Sinn Féin, they are all so much more interested in Dublin than they are in the rural part of this country and that is what is wrong. We will have to change tack."	spk_446

Killarney is choked by traffic during the summer months, with people trying to get in and out of the town. In a way, that is good as it shows that people want to come to Killarney. However, we need to cater for them. There is congestion on the Muckross Road, with traffic from Kenmare and Glengarriff trying to get through the town. Traffic has to pass through the town to get to Limerick or any other part of the country. There is also traffic from Killorglin and Liebherr, as well as to O'Shea's Funeral Home in the evenings, when workers travel up Dr. Hans-Liebherr Road and St. Anne's Road. The volume of traffic on the bypass is at the maximum. It is used by 18,600 vehicles per day. It connects with the Tralee and Farranfore road at the Cleeny junction. 	spk_47
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-02-15	dail	32	Rail Network Expansion	dbsect_3	Addressing safety issues should be a priority. There have been accidents and deaths at the top of Lewis Road. We need to get rid of the massive amount of traffic on that road. Madam's Hill junction, Farranfore junction with a turn-off for Firies, mid-Kerry and Dingle and Park Road roundabout and junction which caters for traffic to the the industrial estates and people from Gneeveguilla are all dangerous roads. The junction at Ballycasheen is also deadly. Other accidents and deaths have occurred at Coolcaslagh. We have to make the case for the continuation of the growth of the tourism product in Killarney. Some €180 million is being spent there which is projected to go up to over €500 million by 2025. If we include all direct and indirect spending, some €410 million is generated in Killarney. The tourism industry employs 3,122 people. We need to protect these jobs and add to them. It does not make sense to have the traffic from Glengarriff, Kenmare and Sneem travelling around by Kenmare Place to get to other parts of the country. As many vehicles need to pass through Killarney, I ask the Minister to prioritise this very important project.

I raised the matter with the Taoiseach in October during Leaders' Questions. Happily, a sum of €25,000 has been allocated, but I believe it will only dust down the fines.	spk_45

I ask him to put his shoulder to the wheel and push this very important project. Progressing it has many merits. Killarney is choked by traffic during the summer months, with people trying to get in and out of the town. In a way, that is good as it shows that people want to come to Killarney. However, we need to cater for them. There is congestion on the Muckross Road, with traffic from Kenmare and Glengarriff trying to get through the town. Traffic has to pass through the town to get to Limerick or any other part of the country. There is also traffic from Killorglin and Liebherr, as well as to O'Shea's Funeral Home in the evenings, when workers travel up Dr. Hans-Liebherr Road and St. Anne's Road. The volume of traffic on the bypass is at the maximum. It is used by 18,600 vehicles per day. It connects with the Tralee and Farranfore road at the Cleeny junction. 	spk_47
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-02-15	dail	32	Road Network	dbsect_7	Addressing safety issues should be a priority. There have been accidents and deaths at the top of Lewis Road. We need to get rid of the massive amount of traffic on that road. Madam's Hill junction, Farranfore junction with a turn-off for Firies, mid-Kerry and Dingle and Park Road roundabout and junction which caters for traffic to the the industrial estates and people from Gneeveguilla are all dangerous roads. The junction at Ballycasheen is also deadly. Other accidents and deaths have occurred at Coolcaslagh. We have to make the case for the continuation of the growth of the tourism product in Killarney. Some €180 million is being spent there which is projected to go up to over €500 million by 2025. If we include all direct and indirect spending, some €410 million is generated in Killarney. The tourism industry employs 3,122 people. We need to protect these jobs and add to them. It does not make sense to have the traffic from Glengarriff, Kenmare and Sneem travelling around by Kenmare Place to get to other parts of the country. As many vehicles need to pass through Killarney, I ask the Minister to prioritise this very important project. We have been told by IBEC that Ireland has the fewest infrastructural projects under way in Europe. I ask both the Minister and the Minister of State to prioritise this very important project.	spk_49

At University Hospital Kerry the procedure is such that one has to go through the emergency department to have an X-ray, even if someone has a letter from his or her general practitioner, GP, to go directly to the X-ray unit. A 95 year old woman who presented there last week had to wait eight hours to go through a doctor in the emergency department. It is duplication, for which there is no need. To give another example, Bantry General Hospital has an X-ray unit. If someone has a letter from his or her GP, he or she can go straight in and have an X-ray taken. Will the Taoiseach ask the HSE to deal with this issue because it would practically halve the queue in the emergency department at University Hospital Kerry if it was to operate under guidelines where, if a person had a letter of referral from a GP to the X-ray unit, he or she would not have to go through the emergency department?	spk_271

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-02-13	dail	32	Roads Maintenance: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_31	We are sharing time. The biggest trouble in our roads is water on the roads. There has been no drainage programme in Kerry like we used to have for many years. I will only talk about my own place. What is happening is the side drains are not being opened. The related inlets used to play a pivotal role in times gone by. They used to let the water run in off the road into a drain or somewhere. They took it off the road anyway but that is not happening anymore. Where water stays continuously on the road, we finish up with a pothole. The surface finishes up torn and broken and then we try to patch it. I have another gripe with the patching of potholes. Now, our local authority is so reduced in numbers, including general operatives and foremen, that the crews are barely filling the potholes with black tar or tarmacadam. It is a cod of a job. Before, they were able to do a perfect job with a thing called a DuraPatcher. A crew would clean out the pothole, put in some tar, put chips on top of that, put tar on top of that and put chips on top again until they levelled it up properly. That is not happening anymore because the crews are so depleted. In one area, the Killarney electoral area, there were six crews. I will only mention that place. There were six crews there to keep the drains open and the potholes filled. Now, we are down to two crews. We simply do not have the staff. The story from Kerry County Council is that the council does not have the funding to pay more staff. We got no money for cul-de-sac roads or class 3 roads since 2011. Until then, there was discretionary funding that usually came around August or September. Each county councillor was allowed to nominate a road or two. If we assigned two roads in Kerry to each councillor, that would be 66 roads. It would be grand if we even got one road for each of them. I am asking the Minister of State to give his Minister this message. The Minister should restore the discretionary grant that used to be spent on class 3 roads and cul-de-sac roads. It is important but we have not had it since 2011. That is why so many of our minor and cul-de-sac roads are in the state they are in. If the Minister can get his head around that and get funding, it would sort out many of the problems in our county anyway.	spk_407

Indeed, the promise covered cases in which payments were held up for one reason or another and a consensus was arrived at that two thirds of outstanding payments would be made until the problems were sorted out. However, where commonage was burned in Kerry, some farmers received no payments at all for Christmas. They have no other income. In the fullness of time, they will win their battle because their commonage was burned from outside. They had nothing to do with the burning of the commonage. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to intervene to ensure these farmers get fair play. It is wrong to take their whole payment from them.

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-02-06	dail	32	National Broadband Plan: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_31	I am glad to get the opportunity to speak about this important issue but I believe that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael would be better advised to work together rather than attacking each other across the floor of the House. It ought to be remembered that the two are in government together. Whether it is called a coalition or whatever is called, one party is holding the other up or supporting it. That is a fact. The lack of high-speed broadband is a serious issue throughout the country. It was one of the most dominant issues at the previous election and will be again in the next one whenever that is. People are sick to death of taking about broadband instead of the powers that be getting on with it and organising proper broadband in the country for all the people. Some 33% of households in Kerry need State intervention to acquire broadband. They are entitled to that connectivity with the world. The implications of Eir pulling out of this tendering process is that Enet will have the monopoly but in fact Eir will still have the monopoly as Enet must use Eir's infrastructure. The big question is whether Enet has the capacity to carry out the operation and to do so on its own. Many people wonder if it has the ability to do so. This story puts me in mind of 50 years ago when a place called the Black Valley did not have electricity. At that time, my father had a massive battle to get the Black Valley electrified. Ten or 15 years later the same thing happened again with the Black Valley, with places such as the pocket in Glenmore where they could not get mobile phone coverage. Happily, the Black Valley has mobile phone coverage now, although not all of it. We are told that farmers must submit applications online, or subcontractors' payments must be agreed online when they are looking for approval from the Revenue Commissioners. Everything is online and the only line they have at the present time is their clothes line. That is God's gospel truth. It affects them when using online banking. Small companies have problems paying wages when they do not have broadband. Take places such as Mangerton in Killarney. We cannot understand what is happening. There were 40 houses to be connected there. For some reason, management pulled Eir away, closed up the trench and left the people there standing, as it were. There are pockets in different places across Kerry where there could be 12, 20 or it could be 30 houses where houses have broadband around them but and they cannot understand how they have been left behind and have none. Why was it not carried out methodically? Who is running this show? Who is responsible? I have asked the Minister, whom I do not blame personally, but I do blame both sides of the House who are attacking each other tonight. They ought to get into some room in here - there are plenty of them - get around a table and talk it out to secure all-party agreement as to what must be done. If they go out to the people, whenever the next election is, every one of us will be roasted.	spk_447

We do not want to create a situation whereby people would not buy the other animals. Only 7% of the herd is affected. The farmers are asking for a pilot scheme to remove badgers.

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-01-31	dail	32	Light Rail Projects Provision	dbsect_23	Yesterday I attended a briefing in the AV Room by a group of farmers from north west Cork, east Kerry, west Limerick and County Tipperary on the designation of their lands under the hen harrier programme, the lack of compensation for years and the scheme being put in place which they said did not adequately compensate them, following which the issue was discussed with them at a meeting last night of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. In 2007 the National Parks and Wildlife Service gave a commitment that any farmer whose lands were designated under the hen harrier programme would receive a payment of €350 per hectare, but this agreement was later broken by the service and the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. In 2015 the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, committed to paying €350 per hectare up to 40 hectares which was equivalent to 100 acres. However, nothing has happened in the intervening years.  Prior to last Christmas, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, announced the compensation scheme currently in place. For example, for the first 25 acres, or 10 hectares, if awarded the maximum 1,000 points, a farmer is paid €2,000. However, as the average number of points for this category is 600, the payment is €1,200. For the second 25 acres, if awarded the maximum 1,000 points, the payment is €1,500. However, as the average number of points in this category is also 600, the payment is only €900. For the third 25 acres, if awarded the full 1,000 points, a sum of €1 per hectare is payable, which equates to a figure of €1,000. However, one is more likely to receive €600. For the final 25 acres, the payment is supposed to be €750, but the likelihood is that it will be €450. The maximum payment possible is €5,250, but the likelihood is that it will be €3,150 against the promised €14,000 per 100 hectares in 2007 and 2015. At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine said that as the agreement had been broken by the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, not the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, it was not a matter for them.

The companies that are so good at providing the technology need to put in place proper regulation. The technology has moved on quickly and there are no blocks or proper ways to detect or stop things that should not be going on, especially the way teenagers and students are being blackguarded. Young people can take things to heart. People being constantly at them, even from miles away, has, sadly, created tragedies where I come from. It is harassment, endangerment and the blackguarding of youngsters and especially teenagers. We have been talking a lot about little babies for the past few days and weeks, but they are human beings too and we need to protect them. Legislation and technology together must protect them from these threats. The Garda does not have the resources to trace the phone numbers of those who make threatening calls or do different things.

It has something to do with the postgraduate courses which are now two years instead of one. The cost then deters students because it costs around €15,000 to do it. Take the example of a young fellow from Kilgarvan or Kenmare, and I know one to whom this has happened. It is impossible to do the course without having a car since part of it involves going to a selected school, it could be Bandon, Clonakilty, Kenmare or anywhere. A car is needed to go from the house to college. I know of one fellow who got a place on the course and everything but he was unable to get insurance for a car. He did not go ahead with taking his place on the course. That is one example of what is happening. Conditions in Dubai are far better than here. They are paid better wages and are flown home once or twice a year. Ireland is not competing because the teachers are not being paid enough. Many students have decided that teaching is not the way to go because of the wages and everything that it takes to become a teacher. If they stay in accommodation in Cork or Limerick, say, it costs over €100 every week and then there is €12,000 for the course. When all that is added up, it gives a reason why many students are not going into teaching.	spk_303
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-01-24	dail	32	Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_26	I have to begin with the most important thing that is affecting so many small companies throughout the country. First, however, I must declare that I have an interest in a family plant hire firm. I must write it up and leave it here because I seem to be telling this story every day, and several times on some days. My brother also has a small shop, so I have to declare those interests. Small sole traders and small hardware suppliers, different kinds of people who are only barely existing in many places - they are family units working together and trying to keep their houses and families going - seem to be getting an awful doing on a constant basis from larger companies which go bust. After a few months or maybe a year, those big companies are up and running again but the poor small companies are left behind. They do not get paid and they have no redress. It is not a level playing field as far as those companies are concerned. Many of these small operators do the work but they are only classed as subcontractors because the big, principal contractors get the jobs. The reason for this is that there is a pre-qualification requirement that a company has to have a certain amount of millions of turnover. For many jobs, this means that there are only four or five people who can actually tender for it. If these companies do not take proper care in their operations or if they have tendered incorrectly they will catch the small fellow. A few years ago one such company went bust. It provided accounts before Christmas to show that it had €4.5 million worth of rolling stock. By St. Patrick's Day of the following year, it was bust and many small business people who had borrowed and who were trying to keep going were left without their money. I hope someone is listening to me. Those people grouped together and wrote to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, who, at that time, was Mr. Paul Appleby. They explained how much this principal contractor had in assets and how he had acquired the assets. The Director of Corporate Enforcement wrote to the receiver who was appointed by the principal contractor. The latter got his solicitor to write to this unfortunate group of peopleThat was not fair because those poor people were left without their money. That principal contractor is back working again and he still has all the assets he acquired through the company he let go bust. That is happening day after day to the small fellows because they cannot survive. The big conglomerates are catching the small fellows, so to speak. The big companies are able to siphon off assets and come up with many other ways of surviving and getting back in action again. The small operators have to abide by all the rules and regulations. They are out there doing the work, abiding by all the health and safety regulations and so on. In many cases, they are personally responsible if anything goes wrong. The principal contractor can get away with that under the guise that it was the small operators who were doing the actual work on the ground, and often ends up not paying them at all. Many people believe that is very wrong and that the Director of Corporate Enforcement or that section of the law is not holding these principal contractors to account. The multinational supermarkets represent unfair competition for small shops throughout the country. They have offers which tempt the customers to shop in them. In time, they will have a monopoly and there will be no small shop in rural areas like Sneem, Gneevgullia or Scartaglin. If someone wants to make a simple purchase in the morning like a bottle of milk, they may have to drive ten miles to the nearest big supermarket. Mention was made earlier of Seán Quinn. When that case happened a number of years ago, many people looked up to Seán Quinn in terms of the employment he provided. I do not agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath that he gambled. I believe he did not gamble. It was clear that Anglo Irish Bank falsified its yearly accounts to show it had much more on deposit than it had. Seán Quinn took its word and invested in more shares. That was the mistake he made, but he was led by the yearly accounts, which were clearly falsified. We have not heard of anyone sorting that out yet. As I understand it, Seán Quinn has not got any fair play in that regard. Vulture funds were mentioned also. I know of a family living over their business that owed €900,000. A vulture fund now has that case and it will not sell the business, which is actually a home, back to the owners for what they owed.	spk_341
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-01-24	dail	32	Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_26	The vulture fund has told them they must get out. That is very wrong. I know of other cases where the people who got into trouble are prepared to pay back what they owe, with interest, and the vulture fund will not take it. As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, the vulture fund must have favourites or an idea that it can squeeze more money out of somebody else, but that is so wrong. We talk about fair play and law and order but there is no law and order when we see things like that happening. Something needs to be done about the way principal contractors are appointed, the reason they have unfair advantage and the way they are leaving many sole traders behind and not paying them. I am talking about the owners of small shops, small hardware stores, service suppliers, petrol stations where vans get diesel and so on. These are people who went out and worked for them in the dark and in the rain only to find that they are owed €20,000, €30,000 and €40,000. The amount is not long mounting up when fittings, parts or whatever are taken into account. They are left behind, and it is a crime. It is actually stealing from good living, hard working people.	spk_343

The weather has not improved since. Will the Taoiseach please pay the farmers who are owed their GLAS money and give them some kind of grant to provide fodder for their cattle?

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-01-23	dail	32	Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_42	I appreciate that many tenants are in a desperate way. Aside from the cost of rents, landlords are terminating tenancies for different reasons. Many are terminating tenancies - we have to take them at their word - so that family members can move in to the houses. In other cases, where landlords cannot meet their outgoings, the houses have to be sold. They are entitled to take back the houses, and that leaves tenants in a desperate way. Availability is the problem. I agree with Deputy Wallace that there is no face or colour to the prices that some houses are making. Happily the prices in Kerry are not as exorbitant. There are some examples, but they are not as bad as here. There are prices being mentioned here that are ridiculous. Most landlords, 95% or more, are very genuine people who also may be in financial difficulty. They have to pay off loans and mortgages. Many of them are paying over 50% tax on what they get for the rent of their houses. That is where the problem is. We have to do something about that. It is not worth the landlords' while, and that is why the rents are being increased. Most of them are genuine people, but they have to live too. The fact is they are paying too much tax, and that is why the rents are being raised or the houses sold. That is where the trouble begins. If something was done about the tax situation of landlords, I believe it would help the tenants as well. Many landlords are not able to make ends meet. I ask the Minister to consider this, because that is where the problem lies. The 50% tax rate is very unfair.	spk_361

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-01-23	dail	32	Report on the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_44	I reiterate that I firmly believe that life begins when a baby begins to grow inside a woman. I believe it is a crime to take a life. Let us go back to what abortion is. People should educate themselves that abortion is stopping the right of a little baby to live or continue his journey into this life from the mother's womb. I was absolutely disgusted and so upset when I heard the way that it is done, with two injections, first one to paralyse the little baby and then another to stop his heartbeat and stop his life, and not give him the chance to live. That is terrible. Life is a gift. A baby's life is a gift and a treasure. The babies that are born around the world tonight are our future. They are the world ahead of us. I believe that once a baby is conceived it has a right to live. One morning before I was elected, all the candidates were on Kerry Radio. They asked me the question and I made it clear then and said that I was against abortion. I am against abortion and I will be. In my term as a legislator, I will not effect the killing of unborn babies, whether they be little girls or boys. I have to and will support the small unborn babies who cannot talk for themselves or ask to be let live.  Everyone around the country, inside this Chamber, and the Citizens Assembly which was not elected at all and whose membership I believe was selectively chosen, has spoken and had their input.The little unborn babies will not be able to say a word. That is where I have a serious difficulty and nothing will ever change my mind that it is my duty, as an elected Member, to speak for them and cite their right to continue their journey into this world. I believe no one in this world has the right to take the life of another. There has been a lot of talk about babies throughout the country. Whether it is a baby who is killed, a child who has grown a bit, a mother or a father, a man living in the lonely countryside who is killed by blackguards or a 90 year old person, no one has the right to end a life or say someone has been there long enough or that he or she should not be there. I believe only God decides when a life should end and it is a good job that it is the way. I believe girls and women should have access to support. If they become pregnant, are despairing or in bother, they should receive help. They should receive plenty of counselling and financial support and whatever else and if they cannot manage, there are plenty of couples who would gladly adopt and cherish a little baby boy or girl if they were given the chance to do so. There is a great deal more available to women today than there was 50 years ago when girls were frowned upon when they became pregnant out of wedlock, but that is not the story today. There is contraception and so much education available, rightly so. I believe there is fierce respect for women and girls who become pregnant, which is wonderful. It is a gift, a life. I appreciate life and will do so while there is a breath left in my body. I sincerely believe little unborn babies have the right to continue their journey into life. I believe the eighth amendment has served the country and its people well for over 30 years. Many decent people throughout the country are saying they will not vote in favour of abortion and the trouble is what the wording will be. We were told in recent days, even by the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, that the Cabinet would decide the wording. Will any other elected Deputy have a say in selecting the wording or what it will be? If that is the way it will be, when I see Ministers and high profile Members absolutely in favour of repealing the eighth amendment and especially if it is to be left to the Cabinet to decide, we will not have a fair wording put to the people. The Citizens' Assembly had so much to say, but they were not elected by anyone. I am told that there was no representative from 11 counties. How could that be fair? How could the people concerned decide on behalf of rest of the country? That is what I see wrong. I repeat that many throughout the country oppose the removal of the eighth amendment and the question is: what will the wording be? That will be very important. We are not being told what will replace the eighth amendment. It is just being said we should get rid of it. There will be nothing put in its place, but the people are not fools. Many have real concerns about the protection of life and are saying, whether it is a little baby boy or a little baby girl, that he or she has as much right to be in this world, to make his or her journey into the world and be protected in this country and the world outside it. They are so entitled. I repeat that I really mean it when I say it is only God decides when we are to leave this world and that is the way it should be. I could make other comparisons, but I will not. I will keep it strictly to what many people are saying. They are calling for the protection of a little baby's life before he or she is born, once he or she has a heartbeat. It is not right to think someone will come along and inject a little baby's heart to stop it beating and end his or her life. It is not right now; it was not right then and it will never be right.	spk_372

They have many problems, including psychological problems, after it happens. They are never the same again and that has to be remembered in this debate, too. I could never feel as strongly about anything else than the protection of a little unborn baby. If I, as a strong man, would not do that for a small unborn baby who is trying to make his or her way into this world, I would be worth nothing.	spk_374
Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-01-18	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	I raise serious road safety issues on the N22 primary road leading into Killarney. I will start with an issue in Glenflesk village located on the N22. On dark Saturday nights, people attending a church located at the junction of the R570 and N22 must manoeuvre back and forth across a road that traffic may travel along at 100 km/h. I ask the Minister to take note of the points I raise and bring them speedily to the attention of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. I have been raising these issues in Kerry County Council since 2009. I tabled motions in the council and led deputations on this issue in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013 and since then, my daughter, Councillor Maura Healy-Rae, and other members of the council have tabled numerous other motions on this issue. Recently, a lovely, beautiful young girl was tragically killed crossing the N22 at Glenflesk. Fr. George Hayes, the Garda, local people and people from neighbouring parishes are asking that the speed limit be reduced from 100 km/h to 60 km/h at Glenflesk. I do not have anything against people in Lissarda or County Cork in general but a 60 km/h limit applies on the same road at Lissarda. Five fatalities have occurred at a dangerous bend at Rusheen Beg, which is down the road from Glenflesk. We ask that the camber of the road be examined to identify what is wrong at this location because there have been crashes and fatalities involving traffic travelling in both directions. We also ask that a crash barrier be erected at his point to prevent cars from crossing the verge where the two most recent fatalities occurred. We ask that a speed limit be applied on the stretch of road from Lissivigeen Roundabout to the bottom of Pike Hill. Tragedies, including one fatality and many serious injuries, have occurred at a junction on this stretch road of leading up to the lough. We ask that rumble strips and public lighting be installed at Poll Gorm bridge, another junction on the Cork side of Glenflesk where many serious accidents have taken in place. My brother and I were nearly blown into oblivion one night when we were hit from behind because there is no lighting at this dark and dangerous junction. 	spk_114

We do not want anyone else to be killed at these places. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, talks a great deal about saving lives. He now has a chance to do something to save lives in our area. The people of Kerry and those who travel through the county are important to us. Something could be done and low cost safety measures could be introduced. It would not cost much to change road signs, which is what we are asking the Government to do.  A pedestrian crossing, with tiles and so on, has been installed at Glenflesk to cater for a blind person. Can the Minister imagine a blind person trying to cross a road on which traffic is moving at 100 km/h or more?

Danny HealyRae	65	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2018-01-18	dail	32	Report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_30	This is a very serious, contentious matter. This debate is being watched and listened to all around the country and beyond.Since I came up here almost two years ago, it has dominated many days and weeks in this Chamber. There have been many discussions about it. Many people have different views and are able to articulate them in this Chamber, the Oireachtas committee and the Citizens' Assembly. Right around the country, everyone is talking and can articulate his or her view. However, the small baby who has begun its journey into this world cannot express a view, say a word or be asked to be let live. I am standing up for the right of that baby to be allowed to live and to continue the journey into this world. Life is a precious gift and sometimes there is only the breadth of one's nail between being dead and alive. I believe God alone decides or should decide when we come into this world and depart it. Many people, including children, fight illness bravely to try to stay alive. Indeed, it is heartbreaking when a mother, father or any family member loses a child to cancer or many of the other illnesses that take people suddenly out of this world. Many women try very hard to start a family and go to enormous effort and expense to conceive. I know of one woman who tried so hard to have a child that she jeopardised her own life in that quest. Recently I met a family who were very down as they were going to have to give up a three-year-old boy they had fostered for the past two years. They are heartbroken. Many couples who cannot have children would gladly adopt. Sometimes, they even fail in doing that. I love life myself. Both Eileen and I are lucky enough to have had six children. My son Johnny and his wife Caroline now have two children. I love my grandchildren very much and have watched them grow and get strong and sturdy from when they were born, when they were so small. I recognise the care and attention they need every minute and hour of every day when they cannot yet fend for themselves. I love all children; they are our future. In the same way, I care for all women and girls. Women give so much to their children, husbands, partners, homes, work, business, politics and everything else. As I was criticised recently by other politicians for trying to get sick elderly people into hospital who needed urgent medical intervention to stay alive, it is incumbent on me to argue for the survival of the small tiny baby inside a womb starting the journey into this world. From the moment of being conceived, the baby has a right to life. The eighth amendment gives an equal right to life to the mother and baby. Many good, decent, hard-working people in this country share my view. I firmly believe that life begins when a baby begins to grow inside a woman. I believe it is a crime to take a life, inside the womb or outside it weeks later. In the context of this debate, it must be remembered there are all kinds of contraceptives and devices to prevent pregnancy and which women did not have in times gone by. Large families were reared and brought up in my parish and, indeed, neighbouring parishes. In our parish, there were 17 Lovetts, 22 Cahills and 16 Sullivans, and my grandfather had 12 children. They certainly did not have very much but the one thing they did have was love for one another. They cared and looked out for one another. In bygone days, young girls were frowned upon if they became pregnant and they were even locked away. That was very wrong. I am glad we have moved a long way from that. It was almost 50 years ago. All pregnant girls and women deserve broad respect. I reject the selective way the Citizens' Assembly was set up. Indeed, there was no representative at all from Kerry and several other counties. The members were not elected by anyone. They were selectively put in place, which was wrong. The Oireachtas committee was biased in the way it operated and the view of the pro-life people was not properly taken into account. Of course, all the people around the country will have a democratic right to decide in the referendum. What is critical, however, is the wording on which this Dáil will ask people to vote. It is not necessary to repeal the eighth amendment, which has served the mothers and babies equally well for many years. Article 40.3.3° protects the life of the mother should the pregnancy endanger her life. The question has not been answered as to what will replace the eighth amendment if it is removed. That is the real worry. Many people do not know what happens when an abortion is carried out. People should educate themselves on this. Many people have not done so. It is really hurtful. It is really so bad. What the abortionist does is inject the baby twice, first to paralyse it and then to stop its heartbeat. I believe that is murder. I believe that is wrong. I could not do that. I will not be part of that. In the course of this debate, a Deputy mentioned something about little Molly and 3,500 children who are homeless. I certainly hope that the Deputy did not mean that those children should not be alive but, nevertheless, the Deputy mentioned it in the course of the debate last night. Another Deputy mentioned former bishop Eamonn Casey. I do not know why his name should be mentioned in this debate at all. What I would say to that person is that Eamonn Casey did a lot of good for a lot of people, in England, Galway and Kerry. If some of the Deputies seeking abortion in this Chamber lived to be as old as Methuselah, they would never do as much good for people as Eamonn Casey, who is now deceased, did for people in his life.	spk_250

However, in recent times a retiring college professor or president said that college fees should be increased and that students should have to take out loans. This, again, will affect students from rural areas much harder than those from urban areas. I ask the Tánaiste not to increase college fees because it will impact on rural areas. Students coming up to cities where there are colleges are already disadvantaged with the rising cost of accommodation. I ask the Government to ensure that the cost of college fees is not increased and that students will not have to take out loans.	spk_253

At the end of 2016, €106 million returned to the Exchequer from the agriculture Vote. I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that farmers will not be left without assistance, especially those who run out of fodder. People with grain had no incomes in 2016. They received very little help and they had to fight hard just to get that. Will the Taoiseach ensure that farmers do not go through the same hardship this year? Many more are involved.

How long will that take, particularly in view of the planning process and everything else? Many of the people who need assistance and medical attention today will have passed on by the time those hospitals are built, I am sorry to say. Kenmare Community Hospital, a new community hospital built a short few years ago, is only half open. Why? Dingle Community Hospital is only half open. The land for that hospital was given free of charge. Why is it not fully open? These are the questions the Minister needs to ask the HSE. Some of the rooms in Dingle hospital have offices where beds should be. Why can we not pay more doctors, surgeons, nurses and staff in times of need to work through the night and over the weekends to clear the backlog? We are sending buses to Belfast in the North so patients can have cataract procedures. A second bus went up last week. Another is to go next week. Thirteen patients had procedures last Sunday. The patients, from Cork and Kerry, had to go from one end of the country to the other for a simple procedure. The staff involved are working over weekends and through the night. Why can we not pay staff to do the same here and utilise the hospitals we have? In Tralee General Hospital, there are many wards closed for a long number of years. Why are they not being opened? What is the matter? Is it a question of staffing? We are being told today all our newly qualified nurses are going abroad. Many of them are going to England. The English health service is advertising for and taking on Irish nurses. Almost 700 people were on trolleys in hospitals throughout the country on the same day, which is ridiculous. In the middle of last May, there were 17 people on trolleys in Tralee. That is not right. The Minister needs to get an answer to these questions. There was a man in Tralee General Hospital last week who needed to step down to Killarney Community Hospital but his family would have had to sign a fair deal application form before he could do so. He was ready to go but it is a big step for a family to sign the fair deal application form because it may mean the patient will not be coming home anymore. I need an answer to this question to know why this happened.	spk_423

It is not for the work he has done or for what he has achieved as a Minister.I welcome that more rural bus link services have been announced by Deputy Heydon. They will be a help to towns and villages at certain times. However, 38 buses will not service all of rural Ireland. I am amazed that Deputy Heydon, being from County Kildare, claims to be a rural Deputy. If I were to take him and the Minister, Deputy Ross, to rural Kerry and leave them in the Black Valley or the Pocket in Glanmore without satnav, neither would arrive in Killarney in time for their Christmas dinner. The service discussed by Deputy Heydon is only a camouflage. Members of Fine Gael are supporting the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill and sacrificing the people in rural Ireland. I ask the Government to drop the Bill because it is not rural-proofed and does not explain how those it will make more lonely and isolated will manage. The Government has no proposal to deal with that. Deputy Heydon said the Bill was to ensure that when people such as the Deputy and his wife go to Kerry, they will not get hit by a driver who has had three or four pints. I want the Deputy to withdraw that remark because no driver does that in Kerry.	spk_269

We have heard a lot about the Taoiseach's new strategic communications unit which is, in other words, a spin machine. He will spend €5 million on this project which will aid Government Ministers and ensure the favourable political fortunes of the Government. While there has been a long-standing convention that the State does not favour one party over another or over Independent candidates at election time, this new initiative has pushed the boundaries of that convention to a new level with sponsored posts on social media, online advertisements and multiple page pull-out sections in the print media. When I hear the figure of €5 million, I think of the patients on the waiting list for cataract surgery. When I think of those people who have been waiting three or four years, I first wonder where the money the HSE is getting is being spent. However, if they are short-changed and need more money, this funding would cater for many of those on the waiting list, some of whom we are taking up to Dublin or Belfast next Saturday and Sunday. It is highly regrettable that 70, 80 and 90 year-old people have to travel this distance to get the procedures so that they can see their families for Christmas. This Bill is also about modernising the Electoral Acts and bringing them up to date with new technologies. The existing Electoral Acts set out various rules about conduct during an electoral campaign including rules on materials and posters. We all know about the rules on posters. They must be signed and accounted for by the director of elections, whether in the case of parties or independent candidates. It is only fair that this new system, which is available to everyone, be accountable to the nation and the State. We should know who is putting up these posts and who is making these representations because Twitter has massive exposure and messages can be seen by many different people in many areas. It could have a massive effect on an election campaign, especially in its dying days. It could bestow an unfair advantage, especially if the Government parties of the time are using Exchequer funds to further their own fortunes.That would be very regrettable. We need new legislation to bring the Electoral Act 1992 into the modern era. There need to be transparency notices on any online ads. That could be as simple as text in a box or similar but we need to know who is sending what. It is only fair that people know who is sponsoring or organising whatever is being sent out online and on social media.	spk_443
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-12-13	dail	32	Northern Ireland: Statements	dbsect_32	I am glad to have the opportunity to talk tonight about the North of Ireland. Even though we are furthest away from the Six Counties, it still concerns everyone in Kerry as much as it does the people of the rest of the country. Great progress has been made over the last 20 years, after the 30 years of bloodshed, loss of life and damage to communities caused by lack of employment prior to that. The wonderful people of the North endured that suffering for so long and we were all glad to see peace at last after those 30 years. We need to ensure that the people of the North of Ireland benefit from the progress made, and indeed from Brexit, because Brexit is a real challenge facing the whole island and we need to have a proper plan to counteract the challenges that it poses.Seeing the man detailed by the English Government to conduct negotiations, David Davis, contradicting himself on the public stage is not helpful in allowing the ordinary people to understand, or to have faith or confidence in, what is going on. With talks ongoing in Europe about the North of Ireland, it is not very helpful to see a man in this pivotal position contradicting himself within the space of a few days. We have to acknowledge the great work and the great efforts of many people North and South. I know I will leave some out but I will mention a few. I will mention Garret FitzGerald and Albert Reynolds. In fact, when Albert Reynolds was Taoiseach he put his own life in danger by meeting members of the IRA in a hotel. One of his family members drove him to the basement and he went up to the top floor to meet people in order to talk about peace and getting the peace process going. We have to acknowledge that. Bertie Ahern also played a pivotal role. Deputy Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness, John Hume and Ian Paisley all played a massive role in ensuring the peace which we have had for the past 20 years.  It is very important that we get a good deal for the North of Ireland out of Brexit. We should not let the North of Ireland suffer, because the Twenty-six Counties are entwined with it now. Indeed, businesspeople around Killarney, Castleisland and Tralee have relayed their concerns to me about what will happen to them and their businesses in the future if the challenge of Brexit is not dealt with properly. They stress that any solution must be favourable to the South of Ireland as well as the North. They say that, even as it is, they are losing massive sums of money due to the depreciation in the value of sterling. They are getting as much as 10% to 13% less for the goods and products they export to the North of Ireland and to England. That is very hurtful indeed. We need to acknowledge that and to see what we can do as a Parliament to ensure the survival of these companies, many of which withstood the downturn from 2008 to 2015.	spk_494

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-12-13	dail	32	Finance Bill 2017: From the Seanad	dbsect_33	I know a family who were ready to pay back the amount they owed, but the vulture funds would not accept it. They were paying back every penny they owed. They got money from family and friends, but the vulture funds will not accept what they are giving them. They will lose their home and business as a result. It is very unfair. As Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice said, they are Irish people. They are our own who were hit by hard times, as they hit many others, as well as businesses. Now, after all the struggles, it looks as if the vulture funds have an idea that they will get double the amount somewhere else and do not want to give it back. They bought it for only one third of what they are asking for now and are still not happy with what they are getting. They want to suck the last drop of blood out of the poor people concerned. In respect of the window of opportunity on stamp duty, I will give the Minister a case in point. A farmer had to purchase the place alongside his land. It came up for sale when he least expected it. As this only happens once in a lifetime, he did the deal before the Minister announced the changes to stamp duty rates. It has meant an extra cost of €22,000 for him. He had borrowed to the hilt and got money from family and friends to make up the cost. He was not prepared to purchase this place, but it came up for sale. Every farmer has been taught that he or she must expand to survive. This go-ahead man in his 40s has to pay the extra stamp duty. It is not fair. It is the same for another person who bought a business and is being hit with extra stamp duty which they did not bargain on. It is very unfair that some time was not given. It is grand to say the deal was done between the purchaser and the vendor, but solicitors and auctioneers take time. It was not the fault of the purchaser, the poor farmer. He is now caught in a trap and not sure if he can make up the difference in the money required because the extra stamp duty will have to be paid. I am sorry that there is not a window of opportunity to help him. I have met many people who are in that situation, but they are the two I can remember clearly.	spk_560

As soon as a person is in shape enough to sign his or her name if he or she has VHI or other health insurance, the health insurance company will charge over €800 a night for the same bed for the same patient. That is what is driving up the cost of health insurance. It has been highlighted to me several times. If a person does not have health insurance, the cost is €75 per night but the very minute a staff member goes into the room and gets the person to sign that he or she has health insurance, the health insurance company charges over €800. That is totally unfair and is driving up the cost of health insurance for ordinary people. It is unfair. It is daylight robbery. If the same bed only costs €75 in one instance, how is it fair that €800 is being charged for it? I want that looked into and dealt with because it has the country and the people who are paying for health insurance robbed. If their income allows, most people will pay for health insurance. It is going beyond their reach now because what is happening is totally unfair. The HSE has ordered it. There are five Ministers and Ministers of State in the Department of Health. I have highlighted this anomaly before. I want it dealt with because it has wrecked private health insurance for all those who try to access it. It is totally unfair.	spk_612

It is imperative that all of us, as elected Members, ensure that our elderly people are looked after properly and to try, as far as possible, to keep them in their own homes as long as we can. We all know that nursing homes give people great attention and great care. However, if one asks the residents in a nursing home who have their senses, they will inevitably say that they would love to go back to their homes if they were well enough. That is where they want to be. We have to acknowledge the great efforts of the home help people and the great work which they do. These carers are the finest people in the world. The attention and care they give to the elderly is wonderful. The elderly people really appreciate them, but the problem is that they do not get enough time to spend with the patients. That is sad. I will give the Minister of State an example. There was a man named Tim. The Minister of State talks about minutes. Tim needed an extra quarter of an hour in the morning and the same in the evening for a second home help provider to come in and help the family member or the other home help person. He was refused that, but there was no problem in the world with getting him into a nursing home and getting the fair deal scheme to cover it even though the cost was much greater. It was the same person in either case, but that man was happier in his own home. Once he was helped out of bed, put sitting near the fire and had everything laid on for him, he would manage for the rest of the day. It is sad to think that we could not get the extra few minutes for him for whatever reason. There is something wrong in Kerry. We do not seem to have enough funding. I will give the Minister of State an example of another woman. She was in Cork University Hospital. I have spoken about boundaries today. One of our parishes is divided between Cork and Kerry. Half of it is in Cork, half is in Kerry. The people in the hospital said that she would get 20 hours a week home help but when they found out that she lived in Kerry, they said she would only get ten. How could that be?	spk_368

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-12-12	dail	32	Home Care Packages: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_36	It badly hurt many people that the Minister a couple of weeks ago said that elderly people were going to be means-tested for home help. That is shameful and disgraceful when a proper service is not currently being provided. Many people only get a half an hour of home help in the morning and the same in the evening, amounting to five hours per week. Such people do not receive any assistance at weekends or bank holidays and definitely will not get any on Christmas Day. They have to pay for private home help, which means that they are using up their pensions and have to get help from family members. That is the truth of what is happening in Kerry. It is not fair. Members know that some HSE officials receive huge salaries. It is not fair that the Government is thinking of means-testing sick and elderly people whose home help provision has been cut to minutes. We are asking that in certain cases where people need more home help and the fair deal scheme is an option, some of the money allocated to the fair deal should instead be used to provide proper care for them at home. I want to particularly thank day care services. There is a wonderful such service in Rockmount in Kilgarvan, another in Rathmore and more in other places, towns and villages in Kerry. Such organisations provide a great service. They pick up elderly people on a bus and bring them out for a few hours on three or four days each week. It means a huge amount to people and the family members caring for them that they can have a break. As regards respite, there is a lovely new hospital in Kenmare which has only one respite bed for the entire area. Half of the beds in the hospital are not being used. Such situations need to be examined. I could talk for far longer but I am butting into someone else's time. Families are doing great work but we need to help and support them and that is why we have been elected to this House. Will the Minister of State listen to what is being said and to ensure that those people get recognition?	spk_373

I do not condone and never will condone drink-driving but I support the right of people right around rural Ireland to have a pint and a half and not lose their licence because of that. I travelled for four hours this morning to get here from Kilgarvan and it will be the same journey back. I would travel much farther, for weeks, to defend these people in rural Ireland that I am elected to represent. I would travel for weeks on end to defend their rights. Those people in rural Ireland have been neglected and the Minister is trying to hurt them further with this Bill. Why does the Minister hate the people of rural Ireland so much? What did they ever do to him? I know they did not wrong the Minister in any way but over the past number of days and weeks, he has tried to hurt and did hurt one family with his idea that the parents or whoever owns the cars of unaccompanied drivers should be jailed if they are allowed to drive. The Minister has frightened one young fellow and his parents in Killorglin. This young fellow was driving to Kenmare for his apprenticeship. His parents got so afraid and frightened that they took the car off him and no he is at home with no prospects of a job. He has lost his place as an apprentice. Why is the Minister trying to criminalise honest, good-living people in rural Ireland who have never done wrong to anyone? It is sad to think that people who are lonely will be made more lonely and more isolated because if one loses one's licence in rural Ireland, one is stranded forever.These people will not break any law. They have not been breaking it up to now. Perhaps they are in other places but they not been breaking it in rural areas. People who lose their licence are stranded and cannot go anywhere. As it is, many of these people would not know that their neighbours down the road were dead were not for the good service of the Kerry radio four times a day. The Government's motto is to drive people out of rural areas, one way or another, and to bring them to Dublin where all the services are available but where the social life is not as good. When I listen to the radio, every morning and evening someone has been shot or stabbed and there is trouble with drugs. There is no end to it at all. The Government has no control of the situation, but what does it want to do? It wants to jam the place up altogether. It is nearly impossible to get in here in the morning or to get out in the evening but that is what the Government wants to do. I met the Minister having a cup of tea on one of my first days up here. We were discussing the programme for Government and he told me that, even if he got everything he ever wanted, he would not join Deputy Enda Kenny and Fine Gael. However, he did. As far as I can make out, the only thing he got out of being Minister is Stepaside Garda station and to be allowed bring this Bill before the Dáil to isolate and frighten the people in rural parts of Ireland. I am amazed that more Ministers are not sitting beside the Minister today. Where are they gone? These people should be concerned with rural areas as well but there is no account of them today. What the Minister has extracted out of Fine Gael is a Bill to further isolate people in rural areas. That seems to be the price he got from Fine Gael. The amazing thing about it is that members of Fine Gael who are also from rural areas and have received support over decades from rural constituencies are now sacrificing all the grand people there to please the Minister. However, when they go to the doors they better not have the Minister behind them because their chances of being re-elected will be greatly diminished. I will tell the Minister the truth. He has angered more people than I ever knew could be angry about the same issue. Whether towns such as Kenmare or Castleisland or villages such as Knocknagoshel, these places are totally angered by the Minister because they know this Bill to isolate them further is totally unnecessary and uncalled for. I am amazed there is no account of the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin. At a meeting of the Oireachtas committee, he posed several serious questions to the Minister and it looked like he was against the Minister's proposals. I am amazed that he is not here today. I hope and pray that he will not be the cause of inflicting these awful restrictions and regulations on the people of County Kerry. The Minister has failed to prove that one and a half pints ever caused a fatality. Why did he have to use statistics from 2008 to 2012? We are five years down the road from them. The Minister said that 36 fatalities involving people within the 20 mg to 80 mg bracket occurred and he said that 19 of the 36 involved people who were within the 20 mg to 50 mg bracket. If we are to believe the Minister, more fatalities were caused by those in the 20 mg to 50 mg bracket given 17 fatalities involved people within the 50 mg to 80 mg bracket.I tried several others and asked the Minister to give a breakdown as to who or what caused the fatalities in these cases. The Minister cited data protection guidelines. The period to which the data relate began nine years ago. I asked whether the fatalities were caused by someone who had taken a lot of drink falling in front of a motorist who had taken a pint and a half, or whether they were caused when some young fellow going home with one pint in him hit a bridge or pole because of black ice. The Minister gave no breakdown or proof, and he did not outline his method. There is a lot of talk about soft and hard borders these days. How is it that Great Britain has an upper limit of 80 mg for driving? It is the same in the North, which is only up the road. There might not be two miles between an area in the North and an area in the South but a fellow in the North can have a blood alcohol limit of 80 mg while, according to the Minister's suggestion, a fellow in the South can have a limit of only 50 mg. What does the Minister have against the people of rural Ireland? What gripe does he have against them? He has a gripe against rural Ireland. There is a man who said rural Ireland is a burden to the State. He was involved with the Central Bank. John Moran was his name, and I reject and resent his statement. The Minister is in the same vein as Mr. Moran. He feels the people of rural Ireland are a burden and the only thing he wants to do is to get rid of them altogether. The Minister could do an awful lot more as Minister responsible for transport. Many lives could be saved. Owing to hedge-cutting regulations, people cannot walk or cycle safely at the side of any road. The Minister did not contribute on the Heritage Bill, which involved a lot of talk about hedge cutting and trees. It is his role to ensure our roads are safe or safer for the people who use them. There was an accident in which a beautiful, lovely young girl was killed in Glenflesk this week. The reason was not drink-driving but another that I will not cite today. The Minister will become aware of it in the fullness of time. The girl would not be dead if things were done that should have been done. It looks to me like the Minister or people in the Road Safety Authority have no interest in these issues. It is very sad to think that this lovely, beautiful young girl who should be alive is no longer with us. Her family, mother, father and lovely brother will never again be the same.  Funding for road maintenance is to be cut. The Minister, Deputy Ross, said he did not know anything about it when asked, yet he is the Minister for Transport. It is supposed to be cut by 10% or 12%. There is no drainage along any road now. It is not being done as it should. There is ponding along every road. When it rains - we are prone to rain - there is ponding of water, in Kerry in any case. Motorists who have to drive into a pool of water when meeting other cars lose control when the windscreen gets covered, resulting in accidents. There is to be less money for filling potholes. They cause accidents because motorists swerve out to avoid them when they know they are there for days. Consider the matters of the speed limit review and the reduction.I have asked the Minister for all those things before at the Oireachtas committee and he heard me raise it when we were negotiating a programme for Government. I also raised it on the television so he was bound to hear it. However, nothing has been done yet. We then had a master idea from Deputy Martin Heydon who claims to be from rural Ireland. I inquired where he was from only to be told he is from Kildare. If he thinks he is from rural Ireland, I will take him around the Ring of Kerry, up into Glencar, back into Lauragh, up into the pocket in Glenmore and down into the Black Valley. If he thinks he is in rural Ireland, I will show him what rural Ireland is. The Minister mentioned 38 buses nationwide in his initiative. Why did he not try this first? I do not think 38 buses would cater for half of Kerry not to mind all of it. The Government should be encouraging people to live in rural areas not trying to get them out of it. The Minister is welcome to come to Kerry at any time but he should ensure his car will not break down on the Ring of Kerry or on the top of Beale or at Kelly's Cross because I would be very afraid he would be there for a long time before anyone would pick him up if he is going to inflict this terrible rule and regulation for which there is no need in the world. I do not think anyone would tow him into Teddy McCarthy's garage in Sneem to get him going again because this is terrible. It is nothing to laugh about. It is a serious matter to be without one's car in rural Ireland. One has no hope of surviving without it. It emerged at the Oireachtas committee that many people in rural areas are driving in the 20 mg bracket. The Minister did not know it when I said it to him. Many people in rural areas travel in vans, small tractors and jeeps and they are restricted to having less than 20 mg. The Minister said he would look into the matter, deal with it and sort it out because it is very unfair if one has only one vehicle and that means one is subject to the lower blood alcohol limit. The Minister did not know about that and I think he has forgotten about it. It is very sad to think the Minister is going to do this to the fine people I represent in places like the Black Valley, Beaufort, Lauragh, Glenmore, Gleninchaquin, Tureencahill, Reanasup, Knocknaboul, Gleantan, Doctors Hill, Mangerton, Shandrom, Lomanagh, Clydagh Bridge, Loo Bridge, Dromtine, Bohocogram, Letterfinish and Sneem. It is sad to think of all the lovely people affected. I will give the Minister an example of one man but I will not say where he is. He is a 93-year old man who cuts his own turf. He worked for the State for 47 years. He is still working. He is living alone. He sets his own garden and does everything for himself. He washes his clothes. He drives to the pub to have two pints three times a week. If the Minister is going to deny him that I certainly will not be on the Minister's side and will never again look at the side of the road he is on because it would be a serious thing to do that to such a man, to deny him having his two pints. He cannot walk along the side of the road to the pub I am talking about, and there is no taxi. He knows it is safer to drive his car. There is no mention about all the cyclists and pedestrians who have been killed because the roads are not fit for them. The 93-year old man goes to the pub for his couple of pints two or three nights a week. He will be stopped although he never broke the law in his life. Three pints were sufficient.I know a man, a fine farmer. He was bagged ten years ago and he only had two glasses of Harp. He has not gone to his local since. The fright of God is on people in case they might lose their licence. I appeal to the Minister not to do this. It appears that he has Sinn Féin and Fine Gael on his side and that he can do it if he wants. I can tell those Deputies without fear that many of them go into farmers' yards and rural yards. They have gone into them over the years, as did the people who came before them. They will get a rude awakening. Fine Gael is supposed to be up so many points in the opinion polls but that is probably here in Dublin and urban areas. Anyway, they will get a rude awakening and so will Sinn Féin Deputies if this is what they will do to the people who elected them - they are letting those people down. The law was strict enough. It is more than people have in the North of Ireland and England and more than they have in France. They pay a fine there in cases concerning levels between 50 mg and 80 mg. If the Minister wants to paralyse and isolate the people he has the power to do it but I will remind him of it every day that I am inside the Chamber. There is much lip service about rural Ireland and that we are going to do this and that for it. All that has been done so far is talk. Pain, misery and misfortune are all the Minister is putting on people there. I am sad to think of all the grand letters the Minister wrote in newspapers over the past year. The Minister wrote a nasty letter about me down in Kerry when he had nothing else to do in the middle of the summer but the people did not think much of it. The Minister may write more but the people will think less of it and they will think more of me because of what the Minister is doing to them. I am defending them and I make no apology to the Minister, Fine Gael, Sinn Féin or anyone else. This should not be put on the people of rural Ireland at all. I do not condone drink-driving and I never have. I have taken the keys off several fellows. I know what a pint and a half-pint will do to anyone. It does not impair their driving and I know it. Maybe the Minister does not know it, but I do because I have been behind the counter and going around the bars for long enough. I know that a pint or a half-pint has never been the cause of an accident. If the Minister cannot make a name for himself in any other way than by having this tagged to his name or if he cannot make a man out of himself other than by doing this to rural Ireland, then it is a sad day. The Minister has many other things that he could do but he takes the easy way out. The Minister referred to bus links but he said he had nothing to do with buses when the country was at a standstill. At the time, the Minister was peeping out the window but he would not look at them or come out to sort it out. He was the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport at the time. The Minister has given over to Deputy Heydon the task of talking about rural link buses because he could not say he would do something about it as he is supposed to have nothing to do with buses. That is what the Minister told us. If the trains stop, the Minister has nothing to do with them either. I am sorry, but I tell it as it is. The people are totally angered. What the Minister is doing is not necessary. I do not believe anyone asked the Minister for it; he thought of it himself. The Minister should stop it now while he can. If he puts this through, many people in Fine Gael and Sinn Féin have stated they will support it. I promise the Minister that they will regret it because they will get it around every door and corner. I have no problem in telling them what the Minister is doing because it is wrong.	spk_47

The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, is progressing a road traffic Bill through the Dáil. He says it is for the safety of road users rather than making a name for himself. However, I ask him, through the Taoiseach, to ensure that the speed limit reductions which have been promised for places such as Glenflesk village and many other parts of County Kerry for the past nine years take place sooner rather than later and before more lives are lost. Local authorities state that Transport Infrastructure Ireland is responsible and should initiate the speed reduction review but Transport Infrastructure Ireland states that it is the responsibility of local authorities.

That is fine, because people worked in this country and made the payments which entitled them to receive pensions. Is that retrospective? If people from Ireland worked abroad are they paid pensions when they return home? Fair is fair. If we are paying people in other countries we need to be sure that other countries are paying pensions to people who return to Ireland. I need to know the answer to that. We have all discussed women who have lost out because of the averaging of their social welfare contributions for pension purposes. Women who left work for a number of months or years to rear families have lost out. The Government has not rectified that situation. Are those who worked in other countries and then returned to Ireland being paid pensions by those other countries, in the same way as Ireland pays pensions to those who worked here and then returned to their home countries?	spk_253

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-11-28	dail	32	Social Welfare Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_46	I may deviate a bit from what is in the Bill, but my points apply to whether people receive social welfare, and I need to highlight something which is ridiculous. We all encourage people to start working when they are young, because if they develop a work ethic when they are young they tend to continue with it. However, the way the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant is set up at present, if a youngster earns more than €4,500 it puts him or her over the threshold for receiving the grant. This encourages them to stay at home and draw social welfare. This should be remedied, and youngsters should be allowed to earn as much as possible during holiday time and at other times when they can source work. Many people on back to education courses are required to attend Turas Nua offices every week. Even though they have proof they are on courses, such as people who want to be carers and who must do courses, they are still required to travel distances. I know one person who travels 27 miles every Monday to be asked whether he has any proof he is looking for work. Surely the fact he is on course to become a carer and is trying to improve himself should be proof enough. Here we are, paying someone in Turas Nua to meet this man every week.It is absolutely ridiculous. With regard to self-employed people, some of the work they get is seasonal. They encounter an absolute stone wall when they try to get payments to tide them over for a short time. They are put through hoops and it is weeks before they get anything. People in these situations have come to me and told me they are hungry. That is a fact. They end up going to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. That is the truth, and it is not right. These people pay taxes when they are working. Their contributions pay for us here and for services in the country. However, if they find themselves without work, as can happen and it is still happening in Kerry even though the country is supposed to have been turned around, they are unable to tax their vans or pay their insurance. If they could get something to tide them over for a short time, they are very confident of getting work again. I know several people who have had to go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in recent months to get food to feed themselves. That is not right. The back to education allowance is for people who wish to return to education. There are silly and stupid obstacles preventing people getting the back to education payment. If a person wishes to take a second level course, he or she must be getting a social welfare payment and it must be in payment before that person starts the education programme or prior to getting the back to education allowance. If somebody becomes unemployed and wishes to go on an education course and get the back to education allowance for a second level course, he or she must be on the social welfare payment for three months. If the person only becomes unemployed in July and the course is starting in September, the person will not be on the payment for three months, so the person will not qualify for the course. The person will have to stay on jobseeker's payment for another 12 months until the following year. That is ridiculous. For third level courses a person must be on the social welfare payment for nine months. If the person has not been on the social welfare payment for the nine months preceding September the person will not qualify for the course and must stay on jobseeker's payment for the rest of the year. That is costing the country money. Time spent in prison in the State can count towards a qualifying period, provided the person has established an entitlement to a qualifying social welfare payment. It appears that a blackguard who finished up in prison is being better looked after than the person who was working up to near the date of seeking the back to education allowance.	spk_422

I remind the Taoiseach that most of the elderly receive only a quarter of an hour each day, some of them half an hour daily, and occasionally two or two and a half hours in total weekly.

He is married with two children and cannot find a home for his family. All Deputies are dealing with homelessness. The motion is different from previous motions on homelessness in that it refers to the use of sprinkler systems and spikes. I have not seen these measures being used and I do not believe they are in use anywhere in County Kerry. Some people will choose to sleep rough because they are afraid to use hostels or places of refuge for various reasons, for example, the ready availability of drink or drugs, but I sometimes wonder if there are others who would not take any place to sleep to get them off the streets. I may be wrong in that regard. While Kerry County Council is proactive in providing housing and emergency accommodation, it appears to have stopped providing demountable homes. Planning permission is now required for this type of home. That was not always the case because I remember once when a family home caught fire that the council provided two demountable homes the following day. The large family concerned were living in these homes in their own yard the following evening. Why have local authorities stopped providing demountable homes? I am sure many local authorities have land on which they could provide such accommodation on an emergency basis to give families and single persons a place to sleep. At least they would be dry and would be looked after in some way, rather than being worried, as the couple who telephoned me today are, that they will be homeless before Christmas. The family in question has land but the local authority will not accede to my request to provide them with a demountable temporary home. I do not know the reason for its refusal to do so but I will try to find out again tomorrow. The Minister stated that money is not an obstacle. While demountable homes are a little expensive, they are an option that is not being explored. 	spk_308
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-11-21	dail	32	Rural Crime: Motion	dbsect_40	The closure of so many Garda stations in 2013 was a serious mistake. These stations dated back to the foundation of the State and they gave confidence to the elderly and all who lived in rural parishes. A common request I receive is a request for public lighting. People are afraid in dimly lit streets, crossroads and various places. It is a continuous request to have public lighting so that one could see if there was anyone passing or going by in the dark of night. I will highlight both sides of Kenmare Bay, 33 or 35 miles long on the southern side and nearly 50 miles long on the northern side. There is no garda stationed in Sneem and if there is a robbery or an accident, it takes 40 minutes if a Garda car has to come from Kenmare and an hour if it has to come from Killarney.If a person needs help in places like Ballinskelligs, Portmagee, Waterville or Kilgarvan, there is no Garda station. They are all closed. It costs more, we are told, to keep them closed that it did to keep them open. Both sides of Kenmare bay are very exposed to all sorts of theft, to the importation of drugs and all of the kind of villainy that takes place when places are not being properly policed. Six homes were broken into in mid-summer in the Glenflesk area, in Headfort and in Muckross and several more in Kenmare. A serious robbery took place in recent days in Killarney. A commercial property was unable to open for a day and a half because so much damage was done to the premises, with cabling and other materials taken out. People need to be more careful themselves. They should not be putting details of their whereabouts on Facebook, particularly if they have left their homes or gone on holidays. In doing so, they are exposing themselves to these crime boys. As the saying goes, when the cat is out, the mouse can dance. I concur with Deputy Mattie McGrath on the need for more help for the community alert and text alert groups who are doing great work for their communities. Were it not for such groups, many elderly people would be stranded and lost in their homes. I thank them for their tremendous work. We hear that Stepaside is to reopen. I am asking that the Garda stations in rural parishes like Kilgarvan, Sneem, Waterville, Ballinskelligs, Portmagee are also reopened.	spk_644

The last time I spoke during Leaders' Questions, I referred to the need for a new Killarney outer bypass which would start in Farranfore and finish up in Lissyviggeen. On that occasion I pointed out the various junctions where there is mayhem and slaughter on a regular basis, including the junction on the Lewis Road, which is the road coming up out of the town and which accesses the existing N22 bypass. There are accidents there on a daily basis, including one involving a vehicle of ours some weeks ago. Kerry County Council is progressing plans to do something with that junction, but I am asking the Government to ensure it is done. In particular, I am asking the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Brendan Griffin, who is from Kerry, to put his shoulder to the wheel to ensure money is forthcoming to deal with this junction as soon as possible. I also wish to highlight the problems with Listry Bridge, which was built some 200 years ago and now is reduced to one lane of traffic. It is located on the R563 Road from Killarney to Dingle, a heavily trafficked road with cars, buses and lorries passing through in high volumes. All of that traffic is stalled at the bridge because of the one-way flow. The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, has to go over that bridge whenever he goes home.	spk_34

Also on the N72, will the Minister of State ensure funding is provided in the coming months for widening and realignment work on the Ballinadeega Bridge?

I will make my request again. Money is needed for the junction at the top of the Listry Road and for the junction at the top of the Lewis Road. Money is also needed for works to be carried out on Listry Bridge to make it a bridge as it is not a bridge, as such, at present. I ask for funding for the 1.2 km realignment at Gortahanboy on the N72.

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-11-15	dail	32	Health Services Provision	dbsect_29	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to highlight Parkinson's disease and the need for services for those who have developed this disease and especially for the carers and family members who have to help them. Parkinson's is a progressive neurological disorder caused by the shortage of the chemical dopamine in the brain. The diagnosis of a serious movement disorder can be very challenging. It presents those affected with numerous emotions and obstacles and a combination of solutions are required, including care, support and information. The management of common chronic diseases, such as Parkinson's, is now one of the most significant challenges our health care system faces. It requires us to find ways of providing health care services to help patients and their families.I hope that events such as this help to highlight the need for funding and services to be provided so that the patients can be partners in the management of their condition and cope better with it. We know of almost 12,000 patients in the country, and approximately 600 of these are in Kerry. In 2016, Dr. Richard Walsh, a consultant neurologist in Tallaght hospital, published a landmark Irish study on Parkinson's disease in partnership with the Parkinson's Association of Ireland. The study showed that the number of people living with the disease in Ireland is predicted to double over the next 20 years but treatment in Ireland is shamefully well below international standards. Older people are some of the most vulnerable people in our society. We have a large population moving into advancing years and living longer, which would give rise to a surge in Parkinson's diagnoses over the next 20 to 30 years. It is critical that those of us in public life do our utmost to address the deficit in services for those with Parkinson's. A significant issue facing those with Parkinson's disease is the number of Parkinson's nurse specialists in Ireland. We have five but the recommended number is between 27 and 30. I remind the Minister of State that three of those nurse specialists are in Dublin and the other two are for the remainder of the country. I ask the Minister of State to provide nursing specialists distributed fairly throughout the country. We should have two in Kerry but we are well entitled to have one. Another issue is to secure an all-Ireland deep brain stimulation service. Deep brain stimulation is a device-aided therapy involving an implant into the brain. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health reviewed this and recommended a link with Northern Ireland to provide the surgery, with the Mater hospital in Dublin providing aftercare.

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-11-15	dail	32	Health Services Provision	dbsect_33	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to highlight Parkinson's disease and the need for services for those who have developed this disease and especially for the carers and family members who have to help them. Parkinson's is a progressive neurological disorder caused by the shortage of the chemical dopamine in the brain. The diagnosis of a serious movement disorder can be very challenging. It presents those affected with numerous emotions and obstacles and a combination of solutions are required, including care, support and information. The management of common chronic diseases, such as Parkinson's, is now one of the most significant challenges our health care system faces. It requires us to find ways of providing health care services to help patients and their families.I hope that events such as this help to highlight the need for funding and services to be provided so that the patients can be partners in the management of their condition and cope better with it. We know of almost 12,000 patients in the country, and approximately 600 of these are in Kerry. In 2016, Dr. Richard Walsh, a consultant neurologist in Tallaght hospital, published a landmark Irish study on Parkinson's disease in partnership with the Parkinson's Association of Ireland. The study showed that the number of people living with the disease in Ireland is predicted to double over the next 20 years but treatment in Ireland is shamefully well below international standards. Older people are some of the most vulnerable people in our society. We have a large population moving into advancing years and living longer, which would give rise to a surge in Parkinson's diagnoses over the next 20 to 30 years. It is critical that those of us in public life do our utmost to address the deficit in services for those with Parkinson's. A significant issue facing those with Parkinson's disease is the number of Parkinson's nurse specialists in Ireland. We have five but the recommended number is between 27 and 30. I remind the Minister of State that three of those nurse specialists are in Dublin and the other two are for the remainder of the country. I ask the Minister of State to provide nursing specialists distributed fairly throughout the country. We should have two in Kerry but we are well entitled to have one. Another issue is to secure an all-Ireland deep brain stimulation service. Deep brain stimulation is a device-aided therapy involving an implant into the brain. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health reviewed this and recommended a link with Northern Ireland to provide the surgery, with the Mater hospital in Dublin providing aftercare. This would mean we would need more buses like those for people going for eye and cataract treatment in the North but so be it. Will the Minister of State provide these therapies which we need?	spk_364

Private landlords seem to be blamed all the time by some Members. I do not condone the conditions of the properties of the landlords featured on a television programme recently or anyone who treats tenants in such a manner. However, there are good landlords. If a landlord has several houses, he or she has to pay 50% tax on the rent he or she receives. The Government should do something about the amount of tax landlords have to pay because it is driving up rents for tenants. I blame the tax take that is demanded from landlords, good and bad. People lose their homes in different ways. They might have bought or built their homes and lost them through bad luck, misfortune and other things. It is very hurtful to see parents and their little children having to move out and present as homeless to local authorities and then be put up in bed and breakfast accommodation for weeks on end. There could be no end to it. It is very hurtful to see people finishing up in that situation. As I have highlighted and asked for before, when houses are being taken back by the banks, local authorities should be given funding by the Government to purchase those houses and rent them to those who are about to lose them. Such people should become tenants of the local authority and down the road it could be the case that their luck might turn and they would be able to buy back their houses from the local authority. That should be considered.	spk_409

That would have made much more sense. There are speed limiters in lorries and buses and these could also be used in cars. These youngsters have to travel.

Members of these organisations do wonderful work for all those who contact them. Why is the policy of regionalising these offices still being pursued? It is another attack on rural Ireland.

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-11-08	dail	32	Heritage Bill 2016 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_49	This Bill appears to be about allowing the cutting of hedges in the month of August, an extension of a month, on a trial basis and the burning of scrub in the month of March, also on a trial basis. That is what it amounts to, after all the talk and hullabaloo in the Seanad. I can assure the Minister that we will table amendments to the Bill. Roads must be kept safe at all times for the people who travel on them. The Minister and the Minister of State have a role to play in this regard. Roadside hedges must be kept cut all year round for the safety of the people who use the roads. I have been travelling to Dublin for a year and a half. The roadside of the motorway is cut day after day. It is shaved. A rabbit would not get enough to eat on the side of the motorway given the amount of cutting that takes place from where the motorway starts until it reaches the Red Cow. With regard to all the talk about birds, I do not object to birds, bees or any other wildlife. However, there is a place for them. The people who support the wildlife cannot put other people's lives at risk for the sake of birds. The birds are not so foolish as to make their nests on the side of the road only to have a lorry come along and blow their feathers off so they will be left standing naked on the side of the road. That is a ridiculous notion. The country is wide enough for the birds to nest. I am all in favour of them nesting but not on the roadside. We must keep the roadsides safe for the people who are travelling on the roads. Consider the storm that occurred a few weeks ago, when trees and branches fell down on people. That must be stopped. A branch the length of one's arm, from the elbow to the top of the finger, could kill somebody if it fell off and hit the windscreen of a woman taking her children to school. There is no need for that. In France there is no tree within falling distance of any road. We should do the same. Our people are as valuable and important as the people of France. Some school buses cannot get up and down country roads. Farmers' vehicles, including lorries carrying hay and bales, are having their windows and mirrors broken. Deputy Mattie McGrath said that a mirror costs €200. Mirrors for some school buses and other vehicles can cost €900 to €1,300. Consider what could happen if the bus hits a branch sideways and it comes in through the side window. Two, three or four children in the school bus could be killed. What is happening is ridiculous. On top of that, leaves are falling into drains and blocking them. If there is any rain it leads to ponds on the side of the road because the water has nowhere to go. The drains are blocked by the leaves. Take the example of people walking. People are told to walk and exercise because they are told they are all obese. I probably am one of them as well. We are told to walk but we cannot walk our country roads with the briars. One's eyes would be picked out. People are also tripping and falling. In addition, they cannot ride their bicycles safely due to the hedges and briars growing out across the road. People have never paid more in taxes, be it property tax, PRSI, USC or other charges, yet they see no services for them. If they saw the hedges being cut it would mean a great deal to them. Motorists cannot see around turns. The country roads in places such as Gneeveguilla, Scartaglen, Rathmore and Kilcummin are all blocked by bushes and briars and it is only with the height of ingenuity that people can travel in these places at all. There is a place in Shrone, Cathair Crobh Dearg, where the school bus driver is giving out that he cannot travel to collect the children anymore. That situation is replicated in other areas. During the storm a couple of weeks ago roads were blocked and power lines were down. The Minister for transport and power has a responsibility for the power as well. The closures and outages for days cost companies millions of euro. That was due to trees putting the power out. People with disabilities such as amputees could not use their hospital-type beds because they had no electricity. They also could not operate their oxygen apparatus. Those people were severely impacted because the trees along the power lines and along our roads are not being cut. It is a sad reflection on Members of this House if we allow this to continue and we cannot ensure that people can travel the roads safely. Consider the Sheen Falls in Kenmare. Due to the wind blowing in from the bay and knocking the trees down - a tree was being knocked down almost every day when there was any amount of wind - the people there took it upon themselves to cut some down. Lo and behold, some objectors arrived and made them apply for licences. Then there was a big investigation into why they were cutting the trees down. They were cutting the trees down for the safety of the people travelling on the road but some do-gooder came along and objected. Fortunes are being spent on marketing and selling my county and our country. However, that is all spoilt by the hedges being overgrown throughout the summer. Places could sell themselves if the hedges were cut. People will recall that 50 or 60 years ago there were section men along every road. The local authorities at the time knew the value of cutting their hedges. They had to cut them with scythes and slashers. It was hard manual work, but it was done. We have all kinds of saws and hedge cutters now, but no roadsides are cut. It is all left to stand and grow out across the road. There are now tunnels on many roads where one cannot see the daylight. The Minister knows that what I am saying is right. That must be addressed if we are to claim to do anything in this term of the Dáil. The Bill also refers to burning scrub and provides that farmers will be allowed to burn scrub in the month of March on a trial basis. At the same time, the farmers are being penalised if their lands are overgrown. These lands cannot be cut with a forage harvester, lawn mower or any type of mechanical equipment. The only way to put the place in order and keep it that way for the Department's officials who come out to check the land is to burn it off. If one goes back a few years, Coillte used to help farmers to burn off their places but now farmers are stopped from doing that. It is supposed to be a great concession on a trial basis, I believe it is for two years, that they may burn in the month of March. It is a help but it must be understood that this has to be allowed to continue to allow farmers to do it when the weather is right for it. As we have said in the Chamber several times, the farmer knows best how to mind and care for his land without any interference or any advice from do-gooders around the country who do not own even a patch of land but who try to exert control. It is as though farmers do not own their lands at all now because they are told what to do and what they cannot do. It is very sad because whether it was handed down to them or whether they had to buy it at exorbitant cost, and many of them had to do that, farmers are the best custodians of the land and they should be left at it. They never wronged the countryside, and those who are there now value their properties as much as those who came before them. All they want to do is hand it down in the same way they got it from their parents or forefathers. 	spk_562

The landlords involved should hang their heads in shame. An animal welfare Bill was before the House a number of weeks ago. Around the country tonight, most cattle are bedded better than the poor people in those shameful conditions. However, most landlords run a good show and operate their properties to a high standard. Due to the lack of supply, rents are too high and many tenants are suffering the consequence. Most landlords pay more than 50% tax on the rents they take, and many will not even think of renting their vacant properties because of it. A landlord who gets €150 is left with €75 for all of his or her trouble and regulation. If the Government is serious about the provision of housing, it should reduce the tax rate on rental income.

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-25	dail	32	Finance Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_2	I too am glad of the opportunity to raise a few issues arising from the budget. I first will reiterate what my colleagues have said in respect of social welfare payments. People are very hurt and angry about the meagre extra amount they will now receive. They have been told that they will get €5 but it is not even clear if they will get that full amount. They will now have to wait for another six months, well into next year, and Christmas will have passed before they can get that extra money. Many of the increases in the budget will affect them in the meantime. Many people, then, are very annoyed and hurt over this. We then come to the matter of the extra funding allocated to the Health Service Executive, HSE, to provide very important services. I stood here one year ago and said I hoped the €950 million allocated in that budget would not just be consumed by the HSE. Most of it was, of course, and we saw no results on the ground in Kerry, where people are still waiting for cataract operations, teenagers are waiting for orthodontic treatment and people are left on hospital trolleys. There are 21 people on trolleys in University Hospital Kerry today. Why are more beds not open in the new hospital in Kenmare? Why at times does Killarney Community Hospital not operate at full capacity? Why are only half of the beds open in the new hospital in Dingle? The land for that hospital was donated free of charge by a local landowner. It is terrible to think that the facility is not now being used for the purpose for which it was intended and there are offices in places where there should be beds. This is very wrong.  As for the fair deal scheme, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, announced there would be fairness for farmers and those involved in the farming sector. A motion passed here in the Dáil several months ago even though the Government opposed it and Fianna Fáil failed to vote for it. It passed thanks to some of the colleagues to my right here who could see the need for fairness for the farming community. The Minister of State announced the scheme was to go ahead some weeks ago but I have seen nothing addressing it or no funding allocated for it in the budget. I was not happy with his statement to the national newspapers that a cap would be put on farms and farm residences for only three years. It is not fair to take an individual's farm into account in the assessment at all. If a mother or father has gone into a nursing home it is very unfair to think that the value of the farm would be adversely affected. The assessment should take into account the value of the residence alone, not the farm itself, in order that farmers can be treated equally to everybody else being assessed for the fair deal scheme. Farmers should get equal treatment and fair play.  In many such instances, people would stay at home if they could get home help. It is very difficult to get a second home help to come in in the morning or in the evening to operate a hoist, for example. This then demands the presence of family members to help the care assistant with this task, something that is not always possible. If it is no bother to get the fair deal scheme for these people, why not ensure they get more home help instead in order that they can stay in their homes longer? Anyone in a nursing home who is still in possession of his or her senses - some, sadly, are not - will say his or her one ambition is to be at home. Even if such people state the nursing homes are grand and lovely, they all will say they would rather be in their own home. Why not transfer some of the fair deal funding across to be used for more home help? On the issue of stamp duty in rural Ireland, I very much regret that it is being applied to farmers who need to buy extra land and will not qualify for the exemptions. In order to stay in the running, farmers have to expand and drive on but many farmers who would like to do so will be hit by this 6% stamp duty. Likewise, a young fellow getting a site from his father on family-owned land will also have to pay this duty.	spk_7

I know what I am talking about because people very close to me have had to do this already and will have to do it again now and the duty has risen from 2% to 6%. I am grateful for the funding that was given to local improvement schemes last year and I hope that it will be doubled next year because people in County Kerry have been waiting for their turn for eight or nine years now. As I have said here before, people in rural Ireland are every bit as entitled to a good road to their door as people in Dublin 4. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine returned €1.6 million to the Exchequer for 2016. I hope that does not happen again this year because people in rural areas are suffering. As a barometer as to what is happening, the proud parish of Scartaglin is not able to continue in the county league because the young fellows are all going abroad. Even in my own parish of Kilgarvan, another six left for Australia in the last few days. Emigration is still happening and rural Ireland is badly affected by it. Let us just take a place like the parish of Lauragh, where the two shops, the post office and the Garda station have all closed. There is nothing there now to identify it as a parish in its own right, barring one pub down in Kilmackillogue. Everything is closing. This is what is happening in rural Ireland. The people of Sneem and Caherdaniel can only field one team between them whereas heretofore, they could put out three and four teams at various times. During the housing debate last night, I asked for the extension of the repair and leasing scheme to rural villages. The Minister of State, Deputy English, responded by saying that the scheme already covered rural areas. It does not. The only areas that qualify for this scheme are those with an immense pressure for social housing. If the Government wants to revitalise rural towns and villages not already included under the repair and leasing scheme, it will have to extend the scheme. It is no good for the Taoiseach to talk about vacant properties when such properties are not fit to be lived in. It is not fair and we will not have houses or be able to provide housing until he extends this scheme right out around rural areas. Many of the houses in these rural villages are falling down.That is the truth of the matter. If the Minister wants to revamp those properties, please include them in the repair and leasing scheme because they are not included at present.	spk_14

Cow numbers will collapse. The bodies are asking that, before Britain exits the EU, Ireland be allowed to continue supplying beef to Britain. If we are not and there is a hard Brexit and large tariffs, it will be disastrous for the entire farming community. We watched and listened to Prime Minister May saying that progress had been made. We wondered what that progress was. I certainly did anyway on behalf of everyone whom we represent, especially the farming community, which is under significant pressure. Prices are dropping as we speak. Not for many years have farmers faced a winter like this one. They have been feeding cows and other animals for the past two months. That will make for a long winter before the animals can be put out to grass again in the middle of April or early May.

How many families have been separated because of this debacle? When bills and financial troubles come in the door, love is not long going out the window. I can tell the Minister that. How many families have been separated, upset and driven apart forever by this scandal? How many mortgage holders have committed suicide? The banks have been disgraceful in the way they have blackguarded honest, hard-working people. What did the Central Bank do, given it is supposed to be in charge of our banks? It did nothing. Where is the regulator and what was he doing? The last regulator landed us in trouble before this. Community banking works well in other countries, as Deputy Harty said. Why not consider it here? How do banks propose to compensate people? Will they buy houses for the people who lost their houses wrongly? When will they do this? What amount would compensate their loved ones because of this outrage? Apologies are no good. People have to be brought to task for this. There is no doubt there was collusion between managers and former managers. It was not the bank buildings which orchestrated this criminal policy. Those responsible must be brought to account immediately and the Minister for Justice and Equality has a role to play in this sorry debacle. The banks have been blackguarding people going back to the early 1980s. Look what they did to the people with foreign bank accounts. They advised people to put their accounts under foreign addresses but the banks then squealed on them, and they were faced with massive bills. I will give one example. A man telephoned me one night when I was coming home along a lonely road, and he said: ""Danny, they are looking for £90,000 off me but I will not give it to them."" I said to him that he would have to, but what happened? That man committed suicide that night, before morning. He made up his mind that he was not going to give it to them. That is what the banks have been doing and there is no accountability. I am asking the Ministers to do something. They should get the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner to round these people up and bring them to account because they know who they are."	spk_427
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-24	dail	32	Housing: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_23	I will be parochial about the housing problem and perhaps change the debate slightly. Killarney is no different from many other places in that there is a significant housing list and houses are scarce at the present time. Anything from €900 to €1,200 per month is being asked in rent for houses but the maximum rent allowable under the housing assistance payment scheme is approximately €550. Killarney is also unusual in that most of the land south of the town is prime amenity. It includes the national park, Killarney House and lands and Muckross House and lands. However, we are now awaiting the local area plan for Killarney for 12 months to 18 months. There were many instances where there was phase 1 and phase 2. In phase 1, the lands were held up because the people had no money or whatever. In phase 2, people were prepared to go. I want to tell the Minister of State that there is no hoarding in Killarney. Many people are waiting for the draft plan from Kerry County Council. The Department has a role in ensuring that more land is allowed to be zoned residential, as was allowed heretofore. I am asking the Department to increase the amount so zoned. It is wrong to confine the amount of land that is zoned. If only so many property owners' land is zoned, they have a monopoly, which means that they can charge more and it is the person buying the house who will pay the piper. It is very unfair. Zoning should not happen at all. If an application is made, it should be up to the local authorities to decide that it is worthwhile, that it meets all the requirements and that all the services are available where they are being built, etc.It takes up a lot of time and in many instances it finishes up being very unfair.  The repair and leasing scheme should be extended to rural towns and villages. It only operates where there is pressure for social housing. Most rural areas, towns and villages are practically dead. If the Government is serious about bringing people back to revitalise them, it will have to extend the repair and leasing scheme to apply to rural areas. I have highlighted many times in the House that 80% of people applying for the tenant purchase scheme are being disallowed. It is very unfair that pensioners who have lived in a house for 30 or 40 years and now have the wherewithal to purchase it are being denied the right to purchase it. That is very wrong. The Minister of State should look into that.	spk_340

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-18	dail	32	Correcting Pension Inequities: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_32	I am very glad to say a few words on this but I am very disappointed that the woman, the Deputy, who caused this trouble is not present to hear this debate. I do not like talking behind someone's back but, be that as it may, I will say what I have to say. It was the former Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, a woman who was supposed to have been representing women, who signed off on this anomaly, which has affected so many women adversely around the country. I first came to know about this in and around 2014. It took me a long time to get my head around what was going on. It took me a good while to understand what has happened. What has been done to the women of Ireland is totally unfair. I refer to the women who are not getting their full pensions and who have been subject to cuts of €30 and €40. As I understand it, there are some women who are getting no pension but whose husbands are getting a payment for them. I do not know who organised that or set that scheme up, but that is totally unfair. It is degrading for a woman. That system must be rectified as well. What was done to these people, lovely women, is the height of blackguarding and we have highlighted that fact. While I support the motion, I am disappointed that Fianna Fáil could not have a positive input and ensure that the matter was redressed in some small way so that the affected women would get some start and be recognised in the way they should be. Let me give an example of what is happening. Two sisters went to work at the same time in the 1970s. One of them had a stamp paid for her while the other girl worked in the black economy. The woman who worked in the black economy, when she went back to work in the late 1980s or early 1990s, is getting a full pension while the other, who paid her stamps, has had her pension cut by €30 or €40. That is very wrong.	spk_416

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-17	dail	32	Local Authority Boundaries Review: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_41	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this very important motion. As we look at it, it would seem it only affects Cork city and rural Cork but, by extension, if it goes ahead it will also affect people in the county I represent, because the people of south and west Kerry and the people of east Kerry have a lot of interaction and financial dealings with the people of Cork on either side of them. This is a blatant attempt to pauperise the people in rural Cork, and areas in south-west Cork and north-west Cork, and likewise in Kerry. One of the parishes I represent, and have represented for many years, is Rathmore. Parts of this great parish are actually in the county of Cork, namely, Rathduane, Knocknaloman, Hollymount, Caherbarnagh, Carrigaline and Nohoval. I would be letting down the people of that parish if I was not to support the motion. I do not blame Mr. Mackinnon, who wrote the report, and I do not know him. I blame the people who hired him and thought of this idea to take funding away from areas that are already under savage pressure to retain their identity. The people from places like Ardgroom, Eyeries, Urhan, Allihies, Cahermore, Castletownbere itself and Adrigole and, indeed, all of Berehaven are much the same kind of people as the people I represent in Kerry. I know what they have to go through and what they have to endure to get funding. If we are to take this funding stream of up to €80 million from rates, with no account of how much property tax they will be denied, we will see more devastation and roads falling apart. I have to say if we go from the Top of Coom to the mouth of the Glen and down into Ballingeary and Inchigeela on the way to Dunmanway, and from Toonsbridge back to Kealkill and back to Bantry, many of the roads are the very same as the day when Michael Collins was shot at the monument. Things have not improved since then and it is worse they will get if this is allowed to go through. I call on all of the Members in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, because they will do a massive wrong to the people they represent if they allow this to go ahead. I ask them to disregard the Mackinnon report and also show fair play to the people of north-west Cork, including Rockchapel, Ballydesmond, Knocknagree and Cullen, and in between we have Cúil Aodha, Ballymakeera and Kilnamartyra and, like I said, Reananeree, Kealkill and the Borlin Valley. All of these places are neglected enough as it is, but if the Government is going to do this and take this funding stream away from them, it will be what I would call the height of blackguarding. Already we are seeing in a battle in Dublin as they are regretting giving any funding outside of the Red Cow, and that is a fact. We had them on the television the other night. My colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, was making his case for Tipperary, and like that, I want to make our case for Kerry and Cork, and the rural parts of the west. We hear there is no problem in the world in giving €132 million for a glorified footpath in Dublin, when the total expenditure we will get for the county of Kerry is no more than that. We are asking for fair play, and we are looking for fair play, and that is what we want, because the people that we represent are entitled to fair play and up until now they have not been getting it. It is a battle and a fight every day to get any of the services that fall into place in urban areas. There are two places where it seems to happen no bother, because every morning when we wake up there are another 100 jobs in Dublin and 200 jobs in Cork and I want those people to give their reasons for doing it. It will be very interesting to see who will vote for what when this motion is going through because this is one of the worst attempts I have seen that will hurt rural areas in west, south-west and north-west Cork. By extension, the people of Kerry will suffer, as I said. There is interaction by people back and forth over our own little border, as we call it. The only time we disagree may be around the first or second Sunday in July, when we are in competition with each other, but we are 100% together when it comes to defending our rights and ensuring rural areas are kept intact. This report, by Mr. Mackinnon, is a disgrace and it should be disregarded. I am not blaming the man himself because the people who put him at it and paid him to do it are the people I am angry with.	spk_326
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-11	dail	32	Financial Resolution No. 4: General (Resumed)	dbsect_17	Some people are happy enough with the budget and more people are not happy campers today because of certain elements, especially the increase in the stamp duty on commercial sites. It will hurt farmers who want to buy a piece of land. Farmers who are over 40 years of age who are trying to get on, in many cases find that the only way they can improve their situation is to increase their landholding. This seems to be the way it is as they have to increase output all the time. I have had a number of farmers on to me today and one in particular, having signed a contract in the last two months, is wondering if he will still be asked to pay that increase. It will mean €20,000 extra for him to pay if the new stamp duty regulations apply to him and if he does not get some concession. This man had entered into the contract and he said that if he knew that this was going to hit him he would not have gone ahead with it. He told me that every penny he had, and did not have, was pulled out to pay for the land. He was not prepared for this extra €20,000. He has asked if there will be some accommodation for the likes of him given that he has signed the contract to buy the land some months ago. This is one serious matter. The measure will hurt many farmers like him. It will also hurt in the situation where a site is transferred from a parent to a son or daughter. If the site is valued at €40,000 or €50,000 it can mean they will have to pay some €3,000 more. Consider all the things the son or daughter must go through. He or she must get planning permission which costs, for example, €3,000 or €4,000. Taking other factors into consideration such as levies for roads, levies for water connection and ESB then he or she clearly has €22,000 or €23,000 spent before a load of concrete has been ordered or before any foundation has been dug. I do not know if enough consideration has been given to that. With regard to the increase in stamp duty on commercial sites there should be some exemption given for the transfer of a site from a parent to their children. I do not think it is currently there and I ask for this exemption. In order to get a loan from the bank the same person must pay €7,000 to an engineer to sign off the house as being built according to the planning regulations that were imposed on them. It has also been highlighted to me today that it clearly does not pay for some people to work. Or, if they work too hard they are not being recognised for it. In order to draw down the help-to-buy loan a person must borrow more than 70% of the value of the house. The young person who may have 40% of the value of the house saved up is denied the 5% tax relief because he or she was too good. It clearly does not pay some people to work or to save. Farmers are not happy about certain things. They are still wondering about the areas of natural constraint, ANC, payment of €1,000 that was taken off them back in 2008. Will that €1,000 payment be given back to them?	spk_341

We all hear about it when a house is robbed or if there is a break-in, but it is daylight robbery that farmers whose land is designated for hen harrier protection are not getting compensation.The land is rendered useless because they cannot farm it as they wish or plant forestry. They are held back. They cannot sell it. It is as if they were held at gunpoint and had their farms taken off them and they are entitled to compensation because of it. I do not know what the position is regarding the purse strings. I have no way of knowing what is there or if the Government has the money, but these people are entitled to compensation. We are hearing in many places about effects on the climate and are told that if forestry was planted it would help. In many places, however, farmers cannot plant trees because to get a grant and be allowed to plant, they must plant 80% of green ground. Many of these farmers do not have 80% of green ground and on that basis they are being denied. Furthermore, they are not being allowed to replant in many instances. At the same time, they cannot return the land to agriculture, which is very wrong. I am very worried that the additional €85 million will fail to lead to improvements in health services. Will it again be consumed by the HSE? When elected members had a say on health boards, we got better results. We should go back to that. Every year since, our services have deteriorated. While I recognise that it is an attempt to do something, 1,800 staff are clearly too few. More than half will finish up in the greater Dublin area while places like University Hospital Kerry in Tralee remain understaffed. Look at the ICU and what nurses there go through at night because they are understaffed. We need more beds because there are people on trolleys. There were many people on trolleys in the middle of the summer but there is no plan or idea as to what to do about it. Kenmare hospital is only half-open as is Dingle hospital. At times and for whatever reason, only half the beds in the district hospital in Killarney are in use. We cannot understand why and we do not know if it is a staffing issue. We are very far behind in Kerry in terms of facilities for people who have severe mental health issues. We need urgent assistance to address the problems of mental health in Kerry. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin, is aware of that. Deputy Griffin is a Minister of State in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. We need to invest more money in capital projects all around the country, especially in and around County Kerry. IBEC says we are investing the least 	spk_347
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-10	dail	32	Budget Statement 2018	dbsect_4	I am unsure about the €685 million that is being added to the health budget because when €950 million was added to the budget last year, we did not see much improvement in our services in County Kerry. HSE management seems to consume the money and we do not see the results. Since elected members were ruled out of having any say on the health boards, our health service has deteriorated every year. There are people on trolleys in midsummer in Tralee general hospital while district hospitals such as the ones in Kenmare, Dingle and Killarney are only half open. Kerry has 9,891 people on waiting lists, which is an increase of 10% from the year before.Previous speakers said we were looking forward to the fair deal scheme being announced properly here today. After the hard-fought battle that our group put up to ensure farmers got fair play, I am not so sure they will now because it is not being dealt with in the budget. We also looked for flexibility so the people requiring home help in order to stay at home could get money from the fair deal scheme; that has not materialised and I am very concerned about it. Since I was elected to the House, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and I have been highlighting the need to speed up the process for getting cataract procedures and orthodontic treatment. We are not sure if the extra money will materialise to help these people. There is no mention or recognition of Lyme disease, which affects many people. It should be recognised properly with funding provided for those people. There has been no funding for respite for children with physical and mental disabilities in Kerry. I do not see any improvement in this budget. There are not enough staff and facilities for people with severe mental health issues resulting in suicides which could have been prevented. I could say an awful lot more about this. We are grateful to organisations such as Pieta House, which has been helping. The health service needs to provide more help to these people; it is a serious problem. The de-congregation model should be revisited because a lot of money is being spent and one size does not fit all. That needs to be addressed urgently. Housing is a serious issue throughout the country and aspects of it need to be clarified. The repair and leasing scheme is only for people in urban areas where there is a demand and pressure for social housing. It does not apply to rural areas. The Minister said there were many vacant properties around the country; they are not fit to live in. We need to get a scheme up and running to address this. I welcome the cheap loans for private developers who now have to pay for all aspects of the house until the key is turned in the door. That was not the case previously; there were staged payments which are no longer allowed. The developer has to bear the burden of the cost from the foundation to the key in the door. They need to be helped and it would have been appropriate to give some relief from the cost of the VAT and the levies they have to pay. Those levies are significant and are preventing developers, especially small developers, from building houses. On one page it states that 3,800 houses will be built next year and separately that the Government is providing €31 million to build an extra 4,000 houses. It is hard to understand what it means. The Government should provide the money and the local authorities will build the houses. We were reminded last week that when the late Liam Cosgrave was Taoiseach, 30,000 houses were being built each year. Those were bad times. They did not have the facilities, such as teleporters, scaffolding, cranes and all the modern equipment we have now. They did not have those then and still they built that many houses. What is wrong? Do we have the money or not? That is the question. If we have the money and the Government made it available, much more progress would be made. Much more progress should be made. Patricia Walsh, director of Walsh Colour Print in Castleisland, suggested that we should go back to the system we had in the 1960s where factories would get an incentive to build houses for their employees. That should be reintroduced to help companies which have a problem getting employees because the employees cannot get houses to live anywhere near the company. Planning is an issue for people who want to build a house for themselves. They are asking for nothing but the planning permission. Sadly they are having a serious problem getting the planning permission. In one case just outside Killarney going towards Barraduff, five families were refused planning permission to come out on a perfectly straight road. Then in what is deemed to be an area that is under urban-generated pressure the local fellow who has lived there all his life is being denied planning permission even though he is only 150 m from the site that he is buying. Farmers are disgusted with the story reported in the  The Minister announced that stamp duty is to be increased to 6%. Will this also affect farmers trying to buy land? It is too much for small buyers and small builders at one time. It could make the difference, leading them to not buying or going out of business. Suckler farmers are not happy with the tax relief for young farmers. This should be increased to put them in line with PAYE workers. Hauliers and transport operators are suffering because of the exorbitant cost of diesel which seems to go up every day. If the price of a barrel of oil goes up because of some battle or row in Iraq or Iran, or because there is a hurricane in Texas, the price at the pump increases the following day. Yet when the price of a barrel of oil goes down, the price here does not decrease for months. What is the cause of that? The people are not getting fair play. There should be a rebate system to help sustain the haulage industry. Motorists and transport companies are being robbed by the requirement to use AdBlue. I am very sorry to hear the announcement of investment in capital projects only in the Dublin region - in Oberstown, Sallins and somewhere else. At the same time IBEC maintains that we have the investment in lowest capital projects per capita in Europe. We have many projects that would create work that return money to the Exchequer through VAT, including the bypasses of Macroom and Killarney, and the Kilcummin sewerage scheme. We have had no Leader programme since 2013. Villages and towns such as Rathmore, Gneevgullia, Scartaglin, Barraduff, Castleisland and Brosna and all the places that benefited from that scheme are no longer being catered for.It is a disgrace. More positions have been announced for the rural social scheme today. I welcome that but at the same time, I cannot understand why each and every one of the small number of people in the rural social scheme in Cahirciveen have been called in to be assessed. Is that happening around the country? It would be very wrong to pick on one small place, which is deprived of employment. It was the only thing keeping the community going. There is nothing in this budget for the self-employed. If they become unemployed they will not get social welfare or a medical card. It is sad to think that these people, who employed people for so long and perhaps lost their contracts, get nothing at all. They must suffer, wait and go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for assistance.  A lovely group of women came to Leinster House last week to highlight the unfairness of the pensions they were receiving. Some of them are not getting pensions at all. I highlighted the issue of averaging contributions here last week. It is very unfair that nothing has been done to address this problem.  The inheritance tax threshold has not been increased enough for farmers and small businesses. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said that the bereavement grant should be restored. So many people have been hurt by its abolition. Many of our Garda stations were closed and it is sad that there is no mention of them being reopened.	spk_82

Some of these people would buy a packet of cigarettes before they would buy food. We need to educate youngsters more and ask parents to educate their children by advising them, if they find them smoking, of how serious it will be or what it could mean for them down the line. I am sorry I cannot support the financial resolution. I see the Minister's point of view in that he is trying to price people out of smoking.

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-10	dail	32	Financial Resolution No. 2: Stamp Duties	dbsect_8	I am against this increase. If the Government is going to take €376 million it has to come from somewhere but I am afraid this may hurt farmers buying land. We need to get clarity on that because differing stories are coming out. Will it hurt small builders who are buying land to build commercial premises? It could be the difference in them not going ahead. Likewise, will it adversely affect transfers from farmers to sons? The Minister has suggested that people will incur a surcharge or a fine for not building on land. If they do not build, who will decide that person A or person B should build? How will that decision be reached? In many cases in our county land has been zoned for housing but the landowners had no notion of using the land for building at any time. It then cost them when transferring to their sons. There are many issues here that need to be resolved. I am all for zoning and I do not think there should be any restrictions. If a local authority decides only to allow building on one side of a town, it gives a monopoly to the developer on that side of the town and he can charge what he likes. There should be no restrictions on zoning land because the market should decide where houses should be built and how many should be built.	spk_118

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-04	dail	32	Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill 2017: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_26	I too wish to support the Bill and thank Deputy Cowen for giving us the opportunity to highlight some of the blockages in the system and the things that need to be addressed. While I am in support of the Bill, we have to adhere to fire regulations. They cannot be relaxed and people's lives cannot be put in danger. We have to ensure that regulations are in place and builders comply with standards in Ireland. Local authorities will have to ensure that those standards are in place. I am sure Deputy Cowen is not suggesting otherwise. I would be in favour of whatever would speed up the planning process. Incentives need to be put in place for the owners of properties. I do not agree with Deputies Barry and Boyd Barrett when they say they do not believe that anyone should make a profit. The truth is that if people do not have money they cannot refurbish, renew or make living quarters out of properties. There needs to be some incentive put in place, as is the case for those building private housing. We need private builders to build houses, but they cannot do so because VAT and levies do not allow them to do so. If they build a house at a cost of €219,000, they make a profit of only €4,000 or €5,000. Given all of the rules and regulations, we cannot entice property developers or small builders to work for such low levels of profit. Instead, they are sitting back and waiting and will not play their part when there are no incentives to build. NAMA and the banks own many vacant properties and should be tackled and compelled to release them. They should play their part. The Department should interact with local authorities and give them funding to buy and reopen units. I have to praise the local authority in our county which has done great work in the past 12 months. Some rural cottages are lying idle and an evaluation of them needs to be carried out. People have asked me why houses are not being opened up and made available. We need to compel local authorities to evaluate all such properties and bring them into the market. People will live in them, but cannot do so until they are refurbished.	spk_363
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-04	dail	32	Water Services Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_30	"It may be construed by some that I have a conflict of interest as owner of a company that repairs and replaces water brakes and has been doing so for the past 50 or 60 years. I am amazed that in all of the debates over water there has been no talk at all of the people in rural areas who have their own water supply and who have received little or no assistance to organise their own gravity supply, deep well pumps, or pumps to pump water out of low-lying streams and rivers. They have had to bore wells and improvise in whatever way they could and use whatever ingenuity they had to bring water into their homes. I feel that these people have to be recognised and have to get some help to in some way ensure that they will always have a safe and adequate water supply. The people in these rural areas have had to put in high-specification septic tanks at a savage cost. The septic tanks also had to get planning permission, which was not always easily had. So many people in rural Ireland, including many in my own county, have septic tanks and their own water supply, yet there is no mention of them at all in this whole debate over water. That is not fair, but then the people of rural Ireland are used to being neglected in so many ways at this stage. It is very unfair when people like John Moran say that the people of rural Ireland are a burden to the State. The people of rural Ireland have always paid their way to ensure they live to the highest standard possible and I do not agree with those who claim they are a burden. If the critics of rural Ireland had their way then nobody would be allowed to get planning permission and there would be no one-off houses. If these people got their way everybody in rural Ireland would have to move to Dublin or other urban areas. What kind of mess would we have then? It is hard enough to house the people already there. We are now hearing mad rumours that planning permission is going to become harder to get when this new report comes in before the end of the year. There are rumours that the report is already there but that people are afraid to bring it out. It will be much harder to get planning permission in rural areas. What will happen then? Do we bring everybody in to urban areas like Dublin? The traffic jams will be worse. Every morning we wake up and hear on the 7 o'clock news that someone else has been shot or stabbed in Dublin. People are down on top of each other there. They are not able to cater for those who are already there, never mind bringing more people in.  It is a constant battle for people in rural Ireland to get their rights. It is a constant battle to get the road done. At this point I will thank the Minister, Deputy Ring, for providing the money for rural improvement schemes for 27 groups of people in Kerry. Those people are now very grateful, and I am grateful on their behalf, though I remind the House that they have been waiting since 2009. I also remind the Minister that there are still 100 people on the priority list and another 500 waiting to be assessed. That may give the House the full extent of the problem. People in rural Ireland are every bit as entitled to good roads to their door as people in Dublin 4. These are not private roads, as the Department has claimed; they are public roads that were never taken over by the local authority. These people pay their way but they are getting left behind all the time. All they are looking for is the planning permission to be allowed build a house, with most of them providing their own water and septic tank. I will give the House one example of our strict planning laws. Areas around the towns of Killarney and Tralee are now deemed to be under what is known as ""urban generated pressure"". That means that anyone who tries to come out of the town and buy a site to build a house for themselves will be denied planning permission. This is also affecting the local young fellow a hundred yards away from where he wants to buy the site. As his parents do not own the site, he will not be allowed to get planning permission either. That is what is happening. Everyday we talk about housing here; we talked about it this morning. These people would build houses themselves if they could get the planning permission. It is sad to see this happening.  We also have the other extreme. Five families on the N72 into Killarney were refused planning permission to come out onto a perfectly straight road, a mile long and straight as the barrel of a gun. They will not be allowed out onto that road, which is very unfair. Despite the fact that the engineers from Kerry County Council gave them the go-ahead, some regulation signed into law by our present Taoiseach back when he was a Minister in 2012, directed the NRA, or the TII as it is now known, not to allow permission in cases like this. People in rural areas who have their own water supply and septic tanks are not getting any recognition. I am glad that Deputy Nolan mentioned the group schemes. Very little recognition is given to those in group schemes. It is impossible to get an extension of a group water scheme or of a group sewerage scheme. No consideration is given to those in group schemes. If they go to the local authority to seek an extension of a group scheme, they are told to forget about it. There is no funding for those schemes. These are honest, good people who want to live like everyone else, but they are being denied services and hit very hard in this way. As I said about the roads, if we have decent roads, if one Minister got his way, no fellow would be able to drive on them. He is trying to deny a whole group of people in rural Ireland the right to go to the local village or the local pub and have just one pint and a half pint. I hope the Deputies in this Chamber and those who are listening to this debate outside it will not vote for that Bill if it comes before us. I certainly hope that Minister does not get his way on that Bill."	spk_408
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-03	dail	32	Leaders' Questions (Resumed)	dbsect_4	Will the Taoiseach progress the Killarney bypass scheme which has been suspended for many years and which way back in 2003 was scheduled to be completed some time in 2009. The new bypass is, or was, to begin on the western side of Farranfore, bypass Killarney and join the N22 to Cork and the N72 to Mallow at Lissivigeen. Another segment of the scheme is to link Muckross Road to Moll's Gap with the N22 and the N72 also at Lisivigeen. Specific plans are ready and the route has been determined and identified by the very capable staff of the National Roads Authority or Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, as it is now known, and in the national roads design office in Castleisland. The new bypass is critically important to the town of Killarney and the county of Kerry. From early May to late September every year traffic jams are a regular occurrence, especially in the morning and the evening, with people being left to sit in cars on Muckross Road, Hans Liebherr Road, Mission Road, the Tralee road to Cleeny Roundabout and the N22 from Roadstone Wood Limited's quarry at Minish all the way into town. If the bypass was in place, it would help to eliminate most of the accidents and the slaughter that occurs at the dangerous junctions around Killarney, namely, that at the top of Lewis Road, Madam's Hill junction, the Woodlawn Road-Clasheen junction and at Coolcaslagh, as well as the very dangerous junction in Farranfore village heading for Firies and Currow. Killarney is, without question, the tourism capital of the world. Built by many great local families and businesspeople, it operates the very best of hotels, restaurants, bars and souvenir shops. It has jarveys, bus operators, bicycle shops and the wonderful INEC events centre, ably assisted by the Tidy Towns committees and the chamber of commerce. The existing bypass linking Muckross Road with the Tralee road at Cleeny Roundabout is now recognised by engineers and management of Kerry County Council to be operating at maximum capacity, carrying more than 18,600 vehicles daily. Figures recorded also indicate that 12,000 vehicles pass through Farranfore daily. A total of 12,000 vehicles also use Muckross Road. The scheme which has been suspended for many years needs to be reactivated urgently.	spk_42

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-03	dail	32	Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_36	I welcome the opportunity to speak on these matters related to pensions and the public services card. As I understand it, there are three pensions Bills to be brought before us in this Chamber in the current term. They come from Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Willie Penrose and Johnny Brady. I do not deny any of the three Deputies the right to bring whatever they wish before us in the Chamber as they are elected and have that right but I wonder if the three Bills could be streamlined into one Bill. There is no doubt but that the pension system needs to be improved in many areas. We have social welfare inequalities and unfairness in many areas. It is ridiculous that currently people must retire from many jobs at 65 years of age. After working for 40 or 45 years, it is ridiculous to think they cannot get the contributory pension until they reach 66 years of age so they go on jobseeker's benefit. We were all at the ploughing championships and it was great to be able to meet the farming community and people who service the business. It is a wonderful experience every year to meet people from every part of the country, especially those who go religiously from very rural areas. Fewer than 50% of these farmers have any preparations made for a pension. It is only when these men and women reach 65 or 66 years of age that they give any thought to the pension and at that stage, with many of them, their hips, backs and hands are gone and there are fingers missing. They will have given endless hours to work; more than many people, except maybe those in private business. They do not have working hours and they go from darkness in the morning until the dark of night. They work on Sundays and every day of the week. It is amazing to think that fewer than 50% have any provision for a pension. I was glad to hear the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, suggesting a number of weeks ago some new idea he has for a pension. Farmers certainly need to be looked after as they dedicate their whole life to their farms and their operations. They must do it. As mentioned by Deputy Michael Collins, there are many women who, if they have reached pension age since 2012, would not qualify for a full pension. Maybe some of them are not getting any pension. I have an example of two sisters who went into the workforce back in the 1970s. One of the girls worked in the black economy and there were no stamps paid for her while the other girl had her stamps paid. Both of them reared their families and did not work for a long number of years up until the late 1980s. They went back to work again and the girl who had the stamps paid will not qualify for a full pension but the girl who was in the black economy and was paid cash will. That needs to rectified, particularly the way contributions are averaged. It is not fair and when something is not fair, it is not right. Many of these women are coming to elected representatives to see what we can do for them. Our group raised this matter in the Dáil a number of months ago but we were told the money was not there to rectify it as it would cost €300 million or €400 million. These people are being wronged and this must be looked at again. This will become an election matter. The affected people came up here from all over Kerry to highlight the problem. Will the Minister look at this as the averaging system is wrong and unfair? Many pension schemes have employers paying in for their employees but they will not benefit the employees. These pensions need to be clarified. Employees and employers do not know enough about these pension schemes and they are not benefitting the employees. Many people are worried about the public services card because they want to know who will have access to the card. If they do not want to give it to certain people, it is a right that should be upheld. The matter will not go away and it needs to be dealt with in a fairer manner.	spk_365
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-10-03	dail	32	Animal Welfare: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_37	The farming community, and I include myself in that, were brought up to make sure that animals were not mistreated and that they were fed, because if anything untoward was done to an animal, we were told that it would turn back on the farmer and that he or she would have bad luck. I estimate that 99% of people care for animals, especially the farmers, and we have to recognise the great efforts that farmers have made. They have built modern, airy sheds with plenty of room for cattle. There is a magnificent outfit in Kilgarvan called the Roughty Valley Co-op. They have the most modern methods of feeding, treating and keeping the pigs. It has to be seen to recognise and appreciate what is going on there. It is a wonderful operation which has been run by a man called Christy Hussey for the past 40 years. We are very proud of it. I am getting many calls in Kerry concerning the doping of greyhounds in events throughout the country. It is affecting the trade, and I am asking that it be investigated and stopped. It is hurting many people who have lived for greyhounds and look after them very well. I support the live cattle trade because if we did not have it, the factories would have more of a monopoly. Indeed, they have too much of a stranglehold on the price that farmers are allowed to get for their efforts at the present time. There is not enough control of mink, foxes, badgers, grey crows, magpies, pine martins, Sika deer and seagulls, which endlessly afflict our domestic animals and ground nesting birds. That has to be addressed, and it should be addressed in this Bill as well.	spk_390
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-09-27	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	Since I was elected 18 months ago, several reports and many ideas have been put forward to deal with the homeless situation. During the summer, the new Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, suggested something be done around the fair deal scheme, where people in nursing homes would give up their homes to put people into them. The word CPO, compulsory purchase order, was put out there as well, and that people's properties would be CPOed. Will the Government desist from this notion and leave those in nursing homes alone? Everyone in a nursing home has the ambition to get better and go home. If the Government proposes to take their homes from them, it is very same thing as somebody going in and shooting them. It was a horrible thing to suggest. Will the Government leave these people alone and, instead, give money to the local authorities to build houses? There is no other way round this. If the Government is trying to hurt people in those situations, I, and many other Deputies, will not stand for it.	spk_138

Will the Minister of State provide funding to local authorities and remove the shackles that have been imposed on them? The four stages of approval demanded by the Department take too long and funding is not filtering down to local authorities. It has been suggested that local authorities, including ours, are not able to build houses because they have lost their way. The previous Taoiseach said that - as did Deputy O'Dowd in recent days - but I will contradict him. Local authorities can and will build houses if the Government gives them the money. I will give an example. At least 25 rural cottages are demanded in Kerry. We will only build seven this year. If the local authority had the money, it would build all 25. It has the land and could put the contracts out to tender, but it will not do so because it does not have the money. The situation is as clear as that. Private builders will not build either. I will give an example. On a house that costs €210,000, more than €80,000 in levies and VAT is collected by the State. The Government should be able to do something about that, for example, make those payments in instalments down the line. The HAP system is not as good as the rent allowance or RAS. Many-----	spk_492

I do not think even Mrs. May knows what she is doing herself. After the Brexit vote, I was the first to suggest we cajole the UK into having another vote. That may not even be out of the frame yet. I hope it is not because I know many people across the water and in the North who voted for Brexit but who would gladly vote the other way if there was another chance. Brexit has already caused trouble. Deputy Brendan Smith from the Border county of Cavan spoke about how it is affecting his constituents. Believe it or not, it is also already affecting people as far as Killarney, Castleisland and Cahersiveen. Small manufacturers exporting to England are paying a high price and losing much money due to the fall in the sterling rate caused by the Brexit scenario. Several years ago there were small manufacturing companies in practically every town in Ireland. However, they have ceased business because, with the Nice treaty and other developments, all our small manufacturing companies went to eastern Europe for cheaper labour. Those we had left survived the economic crisis. However, Brexit will impact them with the fall in the value of sterling which will have a further adverse effect on rural areas such as Castleisland and Killarney. There is much talk about special status for the North of Ireland. We should really be looking for special status for the Twenty-six Counties. With the value of sterling reduced, much trade from the South will inevitably go to the North. People will be able to buy many of the commodities they need for daily living cheaper there. That scenario could obtain for 20 years. What would that do to this current generation? It would wipe us out completely. Today we met with representatives from the motor industry in Buswells Hotel. They are saying they are losing a large amount of trade with already many cheaper vehicles being brought down from the North or being brought across from England, which is impacting in a serious way on their sales.There are many other similar matters that worry people. Every man, woman and child in the country will be affected if England eventually leaves the Single Market. I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to act. Farmers throughout the country are worried about prices and what will happen their trade if we do not continue to have as much trade with the UK. We must ensure that this trade continues. In the meantime, however, I call on the Minister to seek to provide more markets for live cattle exports, even outside the European Union. Sadly, a group of people were protesting against the live cattle trade yesterday outside Agriculture House. I and many farmers throughout the country are not praying for them. We know that if farmers were dependent on the price offered by the factories, which are a monopoly and have a stranglehold on prices, they would be in a very bad position. If it were not for the live export of young cattle, many farmers would not be in business. We are in a very serious situation. As I said, we are in a vacuum because we are dependent on what the government across the water will do. I ask this Government to leave no stone unturned in doing everything possible to protect the people we represent throughout the country. They range from small farmers and small manufacturers to exporters such as Liebherr Container Cranes in Killarney, which employs many people, and all the other exporters in the country. We must do our best to ensure that we maintain the standards and profits they have at present and that they are not reduced or hurt in any way.	spk_536

There is one issue that affects all the State and we must grasp hold of it and deal with it. We are talking about two applications that must come in to the Department from Kerry. Inland Fisheries Ireland will not let us touch one spoon of gravel or one spoon of silt in any one of the places we are talking of. This means the rivers will keep rising and we will have to raise the roads and jack up the houses if we are to keep people out of water. There are 22 houses that have been continually flooded in Glenflesk. All that they will let us do there now, by the height of begging, is cut the trees. This has been going on for two or three years. They will now let us cut the trees. God almighty. We always had a closed time in fishing and an open time. People were always able to take the gravel out from the river during the open times. This kept the rivers flowing and they did no harm to anyone and there were fish in the rivers. I want to know from where they got this almighty power. With regard to cost compliance, there are farmers right around the country being threatened that if they take one spoon of gravel or silt out of the river they would lose their single farm payment. That is blackmail.	spk_374

I am not blaming him, but his statement said that he was going to take people out of urban areas and take them out to rural areas to house them. I want him to tell me how many vacant houses or how many houses are ready for habitation in County Kerry which I represent. We do not have houses for the people we have on our own housing lists. Forget about taking people out of Dublin and bringing them down to Kerry because we do not have houses ready for habitation there yet. There are vacant houses but they are a long way from getting them ready or making them fit to put people into them. The Minister must acknowledge that. The pace at which we are going at these houses is as slow as it took the snail to get to Jerusalem. The Department demands four stages of approval. Imagine what one of those stages was with Kerry County Council. We are building 20 houses in Killarney, the first in about eight years. One of the stages was that the Department wanted the council to lower the cost of the 20 houses. That was very wrong and a needless waste of time. The cost of the houses cannot be determined until the contract goes out and the tender comes in. Those stages of approval being demanded by the Department only hold up the project. I am asking the Minister to say honestly if he has the money to build the houses. If he does not he should come out and tell us and everyone will accept it. I am sure they will because one cannot get blood out of a turnip and one cannot build houses without money. At the housing committee this morning, a Deputy said the local authorities had lost their way in building houses. That was very unfair of him to say. The former Taoiseach said so as well. The local authorities will build the houses as they always did if they have the money and the Government will release it to them to allow them to build the houses. Otherwise, the houses will not be built. Finally, VAT and levies are demanded on the building of private houses. If the Government could do something about that it would allow private builders to build houses as well. Until it does that, no houses will be built.	spk_442
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-07-13	dail	32	Summer Economic Statement 2017: Statements	dbsect_2	The improvements we hope to get in the budget are very important because many people have been left behind for years. The big imponderable is Brexit and how adversely it will affect our country and the people who work and try to survive here, especially those in agriculture. I heard some commentator this morning say that many English people believe the UK should not leave if it does not get a deal. Maybe they are finally waking up and it has taken them a long time to wake up. I cannot see that they are going to get a great deal because they are leaving the European Union. Infrastructure projects to progress our country have been left behind. The county I represent has been left behind long enough in regard to broadband and the roads into Kerry, such as the Macroom bypass and the Adare bypass, as well as all the roads going to rural homes within the county. Without putting any bones in it, I have to say the people in rural Kerry are as entitled to a good road to their door as the people in Dublin 4 are. We have been getting different vibes in regard to tax and what improvement people can expect in their incomes due to tax reductions. The Taoiseach said he is in favour of helping people in the middle income bracket, but then we hear he does not have the fiscal space to do it. He should make up his mind. It is wrong to give people false hope, but that appears to be what has happened. Middle income earners are put to the pin of their collar to keep going. The bracket at which they start paying 52% tax needs to be raised from €33,000 to over €40,000, given it has not been raised in years. What people buy is costing more and they are finding it harder to live and to pay for the services they get, and they sometimes pay for services they do not get at all. The fair deal is a lousy deal for farmers and I hope the Minister will address this in the budget. In fairness, many Deputies saw fit to support the Rural Independent Group on this. That anomaly will have to be addressed in the budget. With regard to home help, there is an anomaly in that a person can get into a nursing home and have that covered by the fair deal but will not get any extra home help. On the issue of Kerry Co-op shares, the Revenue Commissioners are failing to meet their obligations in regard to what they promised. The HSE does not appear to be accountable. There are too many chiefs and not enough Indians in that we do not have enough front-line staff.	spk_18
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-07-12	dail	32	Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2017: Second Stage	dbsect_4	While we are talking about rural Ireland and about Kerry, where I come from, I will say what I said one of the first times I spoke in the House. I firmly believe that we will not get fair play in Kerry until the Red Cow is moved out to Bull Rock in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. I believe we will not get fair play until that time. The Minister has departed but the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, is here and I am sure he will interact and will tell the Minister what we say here. What is going to be the difference between the Minister holding the rural and community development brief and the Minister holding the rural affairs brief? How will this change better serve the people in rural Kerry? What parts of the programme will the Minister be in charge of? The farm assist scheme is a vital way of helping small farmers in rural Ireland. Will that be part of the Minister's brief? The rural social scheme is also very important for farmers who have little to do and little income. That scheme helps such farmers greatly if they can get on it. Will that be part of the Minister's brief? What budget will the Minister have? When we were upstairs in the Department of the Taoiseach a year and a few months ago discussing the programme for Government, I asked the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, whether additional money would be provided if there was a new department for rural affairs. He said there would not be and that it would have to come from the other Departments. I am glad the Minister, Deputy Ring, has returned. Will he get more money for rural Ireland? I take this opportunity to compliment Deputy Noonan and thank him for the great work he did for the people of Ireland. Perhaps one of the routes he took in respect of one aspect was not so successful, but overall I thank him for his great service to the country and to the people. How strong will the Minister, Deputy Ring be on getting money for rural Ireland? I know that he is a forceful man. I ask him to fight tooth and nail for the people in rural areas. He is from a rural county himself. Many Ministers seem to forget that when they come up to Dublin. I hope the Minister does not.  Since I came up here I have been asking the Minister about the local improvement schemes. First he told me that the local authorities could spend money on the local improvement schemes. One cannot spend money one does not have. Until the Minister gets money for the local authorities they cannot proceed with the local improvement schemes.As I have said, people in rural areas such as Kerry are as much entitled to roads to their doors as people in Dublin 4. The Department would like to say that those are private roads. They are no such thing. There are no gates across them. They are public rights of way in the same manner as the small, third-class roads that were taken in charge. These roads to people's doors were omitted and should have been taken in charge by local authorities. Those people should get funding. They are paying motor tax and property tax and most have their own water and pumps or, if they do not, are on group water schemes. They make no hullabaloo about this and are costing the State nothing in that regard. However, they are entitled to good roads to their doors. I ask the Minister, Deputy Ring, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, if they will be supporting the Road Traffic (Fixed Penalty – Drink Driving) Bill 2017 proposed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, which will isolate people in rural Ireland even more than they are already. God almighty, people can currently go to their local pub and have a pint and a glass and take an hour or an hour and a half to do so and talk to whoever is left in those places. That is their only outlet. Is the Government going to deprive those people in rural Ireland of that? The Minister and Minister of State are from rural constituencies. Will they further affect and hurt people in rural Ireland? If they do so, they will not be serving the people who elected them. I know the areas from which the Deputies come. They must consider their position in that regard, take a stand and ensure that people in rural Ireland will not be not hurt further. Those people are entitled to travel and to have a social outlet. If that is taken from them, they will be looking at the four walls. Will the Minister, Deputy Ring, be in charge of the Leader programme? There has been no Leader programme since 2013. The Minister should seriously consider its reinstatement because the development companies that divvied out that fund over 25 years did a great job. It was a bottom-up approach. It is now coming from county managers and directors of services who do not honestly understand the value of rural communities. Something has to be done about that. The summer recess is approaching but many small entrepreneurs are awaiting funding. One must have regard to the great work done by Tidy Towns committees, most of which operate on an entirely voluntary basis. Many of Ireland's little villages would have fallen asunder long ago if it were not for those committees painting facades and the fronts of houses and making places look a little bit better and more enticing to visit or revisit. There are many things wrong in respect of planning. As I have said on several occasions, planning in rural areas is again becoming a problem. For several years, things rolled along evenly enough but there are now problems such as a situation where five families cannot obtain planning permission for access to the national secondary road between Killarney and Barraduff because the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2012, signed something that gave the Department the right to disallow access to that road. I ask any Member going to Killarney to pay attention to that issue. It is a mile before the Lissivigeen roundabout and there is at least a mile of straight road where those five people were coming out using existing accesses but they were refused planning permission. That is not fair. The Government is talking about providing housing. Those people were not looking for anything for free but just wanted planning permission to build their houses. There are now designations by the local authority that planning permission cannot be granted in respect of areas under urban pressure. That could be fine but maybe it is not so fine because people have a democratic right to build houses in the same way as anyone else. Local people in an area affected by urban generated pressure can buy a site and get permission to build 300 yards from the place they were born and brought up in. A person with a landholding can do so, but a person buying a site next door cannot. Those issues need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. There is a Bill to allow unfinished developments be completed. There are people with one house who are in the same position. Will they be included in that Bill? If they are not, it is totally unfair and undemocratic. The repair-and-lease scheme will not help people in some villages because it does not apply to areas where there is no demand or pressure for social housing. The scheme should be expanded to allow people, especially those in rural areas, to take advantage of it. All the houses that are on the Department's list as being vacant are vacant but one cannot live in them until they are done up.	spk_22

Even though it has been discussed all along the way since I first came up here 17 months ago, many people are still in a great deal of trouble. One's home is one's castle, or it should be. There is nothing wrong with Fianna Fáil's proposal to set up an independent mortgage resolution office to give people someone independent to go to. I have no problem in the world saying to the Minister that people have been blackguarded and are still being harassed. Their phones are ringing early in the morning and late at night. That is wrong. I know it has happened. It is still happening.Very recently, a woman who had paid €150,000 towards the mortgage on her house was still forced to leave it. They did it by giving her €20,000 to get out. She goes around the town in Kerry and the homeless services are trying to fix her up. She has two children who have been taken out of the school they are in. They have no hope of getting back into that school and being with their friends again in the near future. I know another person who owed €500,000 on a mortgage on both his house and his business together. He has now found the money but the vulture fund to which the loan was sold will not agree to take the amount he owed. That is wrong. In another town, a woman and her four children are homeless because she and her husband broke up following the problems they had with their mortgage. These are sad stories but they are honest-to-God true stories. The Minister said he was worried the banks might not lend to people applying for loans but he must think of the people who are in trouble first, because the banks have been looked after. The Government owned practically all of one bank but got rid of it as if it were a hot potato. This Bill is not a bad idea and if the Minister cannot agree all of it he should look at the good aspects of it. MABS was the only service that could help people in trouble but, sadly, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, recently proposed to reduce the number of MABS offices, which is deplorable. There should be system for people who get into trouble in order that they can remain in their homes. The local authorities could buy the house and rent it back to them but we must not continue to put people out on the side of the road. Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill deserves more consideration.	spk_558

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-07-11	dail	32	Waste Reduction Bill 2017: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_44	The amount of waste and rubbish, especially bottles, seems to be multiplying all the time. In different times, there was a charge on bottles. In pubs or anywhere else, when someone took a bottle away and then brought it back, one got back whatever they had been charged for it. Publicans were sub-charged for bottles and if they did not return them, they had to pay the bill which was very costly. Bottles were sterilised and reused, but no one can tell me that it is cheaper to break and take bottles away and manufacture them again rather than simply reuse them. I cannot understand it and it did not make sense to stop that system. Bottles by the bin are sent all the time to be recycled at a high cost, which causes trouble. As the customer does not get his or her money back, he or she so has no interest in bringing bottles back. The use of plastic bottles could be reduced if more companies were to start using glass bottles again. Supermarkets provide a great facility to have a cup of tea or coffee, but all of the cups seem to be thrown away. If long distance drivers or others on the roads all the time were educated or encouraged to use a flask-type cup and have it refilled in a supermarket - at a cost, of course - it would eliminate the need to use many of the paper cups which are thrown away.  On the greater problem, there is a need for everyone to review the possibility of reusing some of the waste that goes into the bin. It is a shame that food is dumped. Long ago people would have fed pigs and had meat of their own. There are many starving children in Third World countries who would be very grateful to receive food that is only days out of date.	spk_453
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-07-06	dail	32	Quarterly Report on Housing: Statements	dbsect_2	There are a number of small things that could be done to help sort out much of the homelessness problem. Some genius decided that bedsits could not be used anymore, while fortunes are being paid to hotels to house people and people are still lying on the ground close to the hotel where I stay for two or three days every week. I am sure they would be much happier in a bedsit. I am not saying that all bedsits were perfect but some were fine and they would give shelter to people. The rule preventing bedsits must be reviewed. There are big grants for the repair and lease scheme, which is a fine scheme but the councils tell us it will only be available where there is a demand for social housing. It should be extended to towns and villages where there is no pressure for social housing. The home improvement grant suits some people, notably PAYE workers, but not others such as sole traders or private operators. It should be expanded to include more people if we are serious about addressing homelessness. Yesterday I asked about reducing the age for grant aid for the elderly to 50, to help the people of whom I spoke. As regards social housing, in Kerry there are 5,000 on the list. I do not agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath's assertion that local authorities have lost their way when it comes to building houses. There are too many hoops to jump through and stipulations by the Department for people to get planning permission for even a rural cottage. That is wrong. As I said to the former Taoiseach, when one goes too far east around the globe, one comes back again to the west. That is what has happened. Some 82% of people who apply for the tenant purchase scheme are not successful. This deprives people on pensions from buying out the house in which they have lived for 40 or 50 years. They may come into a bit of money, perhaps by way of a lump sum, and they would like to buy out their house and stay there for their remaining days but they are being denied that opportunity in the new tenant purchase scheme. This must be looked at. The former Minister, Deputy Coveney, said in Tralee that pensioners who went back to live with their offspring and left a vacant house could lease that house, but if they do that their pension will be taken off them. They do not want to sell the house to someone else as they may want to go back to live there so something needs to be done in this regard. There are many such houses lying around. For private builders, €80,000 of the total cost of €210,000 for building a house goes in VAT and levies to the local authority. Something needs to be done about that to kickstart private builders into building more. At the moment they cannot make a profit with all the regulations and red tape. It would get more builders building and more people working. The Minister should look at these suggestions if he is serious about reducing housing lists. They are small but they will help a lot.	spk_19
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-07-06	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_3	I refer to the former St. Finan's Hospital in Killarney, a well built stone building which stands on 30 acres of land on the northside of the town which borders both sides of the bypass. It is a listed building, for which plans for its future use need to be formulated. We are all aware of what happened this week to a similar building, the former Our Lady's Hospital in Shanakiel. Much of it was burnt to the ground. At one time there were 800 patients and 800 staff at St. Finan's Hospital. Years ago the building and lands were owned and managed by Kerry County Council, but they were then transferred into the ownership of the HSE. On behalf of many interests in Killarney and surrounding areas, I raised the issue of the future plans for the building and lands at forum meetings of HSE south. It is important that they are not sold to private interests. The Government and the Minister for Health need to work together to formulate a plan for what is to be done with this valuable property. I sincerely hope it is insured and that there is security in place 24/7. Killarney is to shortly have a new community hospital which is expected to be built on part of the lands surrounding the former hospital. I am asking the HSE to liaise with Kerry County Council on the proposed use of the remaining land. As all Members are aware, we are experiencing a shortage of housing and many houses could be built on these lands. Also, part of the grounds could and should be used to provide a safer route from the town onto the bypass. There have been many accidents at the Lewis Road junction and further accidents could be avoided if another access road to the bypass was provided. The former hospital building could be adapted to provide social housing apartments or offices or for amenity use and made available to local voluntary sports clubs and other groups. As parts of the roof are leaking, the building will soon be derelict. As it is situated adjacent to the Fitzgerald Stadium, it would be a shame if it were allowed to fall into dereliction. If the property was owned by private interests, it would not be left unused, as it is very valuable. It was suggested previously that the land could be used as a graveyard or a car park. As there are many uses to which it could be put, it should not be left idle. As I said, if the property was in private ownership, it would be developed and used.	spk_100

Services have been cut, including those for people with disabilities. Even death grants are not to be had anymore.

It is the wish of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Government that the social housing lists be reduced. This could be done if a number of things were rectified. To be eligible for grant aid from Kerry County Council a person must be 66 years of age. A number of years ago - I cannot recall when - a person in his or her late 50s, whose house was in bad repair, was eligible for grant aid of approximately €8,000, which is a lot of money to those who qualified for it. I have been approached by a number of people aged 50 years upwards who have been refused grant aid because, as I said, to be eligible for a grant a person must be 66 years of age. Many of these people end up on the social housing list because their houses are in bad repair. It may be that the roofs of the houses are leaking or that the windows and doors are in a bad state. Also, many of these people are unemployed. They might be in good shape but they cannot get work. If they were disabled they would be eligible for the disabled person's grant. As these people do not qualify for grant aid for house improvements they end up on the housing list. In regard to the improvement works in lieu, IWL, scheme, while funding provided under this scheme is deemed to be a grant, it is actually a loan. Those who qualify for it are required to pay back a set amount each week to Kerry County Council, often by way of deductions from their social welfare benefits. Many people are being denied this facility because of the stipulation that to qualify a house must have cavity block walls. People whose houses have cavity block walls do not need a grant. People whose houses have stone built walls do not qualify for the improvement works in lieu scheme but they only find this out when their applications have been refused because of this stipulation. I am asking that this provision be reviewed because it is totally unfair. It is the people whose houses have stone walls that are in greatest need of this grant, which in my view should be termed a loan. Applications for these loans are required to be vetted by housing engineers. Applicants should be told in the first instance that if their house has stone walls they should not apply but they are not told this until after an application has been vetted by two engineers. The purpose of the first engineer visit is to determine whether the works qualify under the scheme and this is followed up by a visit from a second engineer, such that much time is invested in and wasted on assessment of applications. I am asking that the Minister review these two schemes. If he does so, it will help stop the flow of people onto the housing lists, as is currently happening in Kerry. There are many such cases arising in the Kerry local authority area.	spk_411

I will have to investigate that further. The housing aid for older people scheme is a great scheme and it had ensured that many elderly people have been able to stay in their own homes. We really appreciate that. A person can be old at the age of 50 or 55. A women who was 102 years old contacted me by phone the other day and from my conversation with her she did not seem to be old. It is all about the way people interpret matters and their attitude. Some people on reaching the age of 50 can be in bad shape and not able to work as they were able to do when they were younger or they may not be able to get a job. We would like if such people could also stay in their homes. If matters improved a little, perhaps the age requirement for grant aid could be reduced. That is what I am asking for and that it be done as soon as possible, as those people would also like to stay in their homes. We need to maximise the houses we have. Many houses are currently vacant but many of them are not fit to live in. I hope those houses are not being counted in the number of vacant houses because many of them are certainly not fit to live in. Even though some of these people are continuing to live in these houses, they are not fit for human habitation, having regard to the modern housing standards enjoyed by most people. If that rule for grant aid could be reduced to under the age of 60, it would help a good few people and keep them off the housing list. A person can find a leak in a roof and on investigation more work may need to be done, which may be costly, and they may be afraid to do it, but repairing it can become more costly if the roof is not repaired when the leak is discovered. There is a good reason for reducing the age requirement. The Minister of State has made me wise about the stone wall issue.

I wish the Minister and the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, the very best in their bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023. This is a wonderful opportunity to showcase the venues and the country all around the world, and the advertising of Ireland in this way will pay for the costs incurred and the staging of the event. It has been indicated that Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney is to be one of the venues. I am confident that Killarney, Kenmare, Castleisland, Killorglin and Tralee and many other hostelries around the Ring of Kerry will cater and provide accommodation second to none to the teams, visitors and followers. I have every confidence in the Fitzgerald Stadium committee. Tim Murphy, our new and very able chairman, and members of the county board will have the stadium gleaming and ready for whatever bustle and pressure comes with staging the games. Where else in the world is their a venue situated in such a beautiful setting surrounded by the three beautiful lakes and under the shadow of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks? However, work has to be done in the meantime and whatever about the snails and the begrudgers, the Macroom-Ballyvourney bypass will have to be completed in time to ensure that these big sportsmen will not be parked in their cars and buses in Macroom when they should be togged out in Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney. It is up to this Government to provide the funding for this project immediately and to ensure that after all the waiting, the infrastructure - by that I mean a proper road from Cork to Killarney - will be place for 2023. I wish the IRFU and the Minister all the very best. We hope that we will be successful in November in ensuring that this massive opportunity comes to Ireland. We have followers of rugby around Castleisland and Currow. We had great men there who represented Munster and Ireland down the years and they had supporters and followers. They deserve that the Rugby World Cup comes to this country. I wish to raise another matter that is not related to rugby. A group of farmers are waiting in Agriculture House to be met by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed. They are seeking compensation for the loss of their crops last year. I call on the Minister to meet them. The Minister, Deputy Ross, is also a member of the Government. Those men will stay there until the Minister, Deputy Creed, meets them.

Everything that is collected by voluntary groups is heaped up in different towns and villages and it collects it and deals with it. We thank it very much for that. Kerry County Council got out of waste collecting a number of years ago. Since then, KWD and others have operated a very good service and we have no complaints. For the last seven or eight years, KWD has operated a flat rate pay system alongside a pay-by-weight for those who want to pay that way. We will still have to operate the two systems side-by-side because the pay-by-weight will suit some but not others. It may be the fairest for elderly people who would not have much waste. There must be recognition for people who are medically incontinent, and €75 is not enough. Big families with a lot of children cannot cut down on their waste, as hard as they might try. They will have to have some allowance or help as it is already clear that some of these people cannot provide enough food to feed their children. When the Minister suggested that a local authority could provide a waiver system if it wanted, where does he think it will get the money? Will the Government give it that money? Will the Government give the cost of the waiver back to the local authority? The Minister must answer that question. We were told that local authorities could operate the local improvement scheme, and they could but they have no money to do that. This is the same story. The Government collects around €50 million from the 13.5% VAT charged to every customer that waste is collected from.	spk_372

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-06-28	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_4	Much has been said about the provision of housing but there are blockages caused by the Department. In the context of grant aid for the elderly, the age was increased to 66 years when, previously, people in their 50s were considered eligible to apply. People are presenting now but there is no grant to cover them. If one is 50 years of age or over, it is unlikely that one will get a job if one is unemployed so the age criteria need to be reduced. The improvement works in lieu grant is really a loan rather than a grant. That is not working because one of the stipulations is that in order to be considered for it, the walls of a house have to be built with cavity blocks. If one has a house with cavity walls, that is fine but the walls that need to be addressed are old stone walls. The grant must be expanded to allow people with old stone walls to qualify for the improvement works in lieu grant.	spk_113

As I said previously, the decrease in the value of sterling is seriously impacting on small businesses right around the country who are exporting to Britain and the North of Ireland. Such people are experiencing a reduction in income. That issue and the impact of Brexit that is already being felt must be highlighted to the foreign affairs Ministers and others in Europe. Farmers will be affected right around the hills, valleys and glens of this country and when farmers are affected, all the businesses that feed off them will be adversely affected as well. That issue must be highlighted. The motor industry is already starting to suffer. There is a decline in car sales because cars are being imported from across the water and from the North of Ireland as they can be bought more cheaply there due to the reduction in the value of sterling. IBEC has already said the regions will suffer following Brexit. When it talks about ""the regions"" I understand it to mean rural areas. It has been said that urban areas will prosper. The Taoiseach must understand that urban regions are already doing very well but rural areas are not and if they are affected any further it could mean a significant decline in population as there will be an exodus of people leaving rural areas. I note the Paris Agreement was discussed at the European Council. It is important to bear in mind that one cannot get blood out of a turnip. Is that all that was gained by the talks in Europe last week? I am concerned that farmers, who face a reduction in the amount of money they get for their produce, will be expected to pay for the Paris Agreement. I do not believe there is any hurry attached to the Paris Agreement because as I said previously in the Chamber, we cannot do anything about the weather. God above is in charge of that. If farmers and business people are expected to pay more in carbon tax because of the Paris Agreement they will be hurt more. I repeat; one cannot get blood out of a turnip. There is much talk about exemptions for the North of Ireland and that is fine, but we must remember that we are representing the Twenty-six Counties and the people who are trying to live and work in this country and they need to be looked after. If we do not do that then we will not be here either."	spk_251

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-06-28	dail	32	Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_36	I was amazed to hear Deputy O'Dowd say he was unhappy with the system when there was an adjudication in his own case going back a number of years. I am wondering why he wanted to change the system that had served him so well. This Bill proposes a lay majority on the appointments commission, which will comprise seven lay people, three judges, one Attorney General and two representatives of the legal profession. It also suggests that the role of the Chief Justice, who would be on the committee, would be taken by some lay person. This is amazing and it is ridiculous that the Chief Justice, with so much experience having started as a solicitor, then become a barrister, then a judge, would be set aside in favour of a lay person who may know nothing at all about the operation of justice and the administration of fair play for people who come before our courts. The members of the Judiciary are the people who protect our people and there was no harm in the way the system operated up to now, with the judges selecting a person for the Government to present that person to be appointed by the President. It was transparent and I cannot see any need to change that system. We need to protect the quality, diligence and independence of the Judiciary, who were appointed by the President on the advice of the Government. The members of the Judiciary have the key skills, knowledge and experience to select the people they think would be suitable to be judges. It is too vague for them to be selected by the Public Appointments Service and it is not as transparent as the process we had. Judges should be appointed on merit, experience, education and ability and this can only be adjudicated on properly and fairly by the members of the Judiciary who have worked in the same arena as the barristers or whoever is going forward to be selected as a judge.They must have regard to the work ethic and, as I said, the ability, education and experience of a person putting himself or herself forward for appointment. The worry I have relates to who will make up the lay majority. Who will select them? The quality of applicants who will put themselves forward for appointment to the judicial appointments commission is a worry for me, as it should be for all Members. We all know what happened during the building boom, when some builders and developers knew what they were doing but many others who did not joined the queue and drove the whole thing mad and it all collapsed. There have always been fair and honourable judges in County Kerry who carried out their duties without fear or favour having lived among the people on whom they adjudicated. It is important to remember that we should seek to continue to deliver a fair justice system under which offenders will be penalised and those who have been offended or hurt will receive redress or compensation. It is most important to deliver justice for all of the people of the country, which we have had for many years. Many speakers have said the proposed model would be similar to the British or English model. It amazes me that Sinn Féin is supporting the Bill. In the context of what happened to the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and many others, it is amazing to hear Sinn Féin is supporting this proposal if it is like the British system. That is ridiculous. It must not be forgotten that lay people, as the Minister described them, are already involved in the justice system. Hundreds, if not thousands, of working people do jury service all over the country every Monday through to Friday. People from every walk of life make up juries in courts all around the country. They do a great job and provide a sufficient balance. We have a great Courts Service. I have been in court. We have all been afraid of judges and tried to stay out of court as best we can, but sometimes a person ends up there one way or another. I have faith and confidence in the judicial system. The judges are independent. They may have been appointed by Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, but I cannot say they have only worked in favour of the party which appointed them. It would be a very bad slur to suggest that because they do not do so. They know and apply the law. They have been educated and gone through the mill, starting as solicitors or barristers and moving up the line to become judges. They worked their way up the line and have dispensed fair justice to all along the way. There was no reason to hurry this Bill through and I wonder why it was selected ahead of the numerous Bills that would help people which are awaiting consideration by the House. Many Bills deal with more important issues than this. An example is the fair deal scheme for farmers, which I think is lousy. Many other issues need to be addressed such as help for the homeless or those awaiting hospital appointments. There is a lot of other work which could be done and on which money could be more wisely spent. We could be helping people such as those who are still being allowed to go blind in County Kerry and west Cork. There are many other pressing issues that should be addressed ahead of this one. How was it pulled out of the bag and put ahead of so many more important issues? I cannot remember all of them, but I do not think this Bill is a priority. I do not know what gripe or spite the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, has with or for the judges or the judicial system, although that might emerge in time.	spk_461

I thank the former members and management in the town councils of Killarney, Tralee and Listowel, who did great work in building up their towns to the great places they are today, providing the basic infrastructure such as water, roads, sewerage, footpaths, housing and amenities, all with very limited funds. Town councillors did not receive big money but gave great service to the people in areas they represented. The former Minister, Phil Hogan, thought that when he struck out town councils he was saving a lot of money but no money has been saved and it is good that we retained management, staff and work crews who are still working on behalf of our towns and the people in them. That is what the people got when they elected the last Government with one of the largest majorities in the history of the State. Fine Gael and the Labour Party did this to the people who elected them. They kicked them in the teeth and they kicked them in the backside because they have practically got rid of local development companies which delivered the Leader programmes and gave a bottom-up service to people in rural areas.

In others words, the turbines are still too close. Four times 150 m is only 600 m and that is too near to a dwelling. What are we going to do about that to take it on board? It is very unfair.	spk_175
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-06-21	dail	32	Pre-European Council: Statements	dbsect_11	I wish the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, well in her new role. We are sorry to lose her from her last Ministry because she had a lot of input into the fair deal scheme that we are trying to get for the farming community. She understood it well. We only hope that the new Minister of State will be as conversant with it as she was. We wish her all the very best for the future. We are elected to this House by the people who vote for us to represent them. There are small businesses in Castleisland, Killarney, Tralee and Killorglin in Kerry which are very worried about the reduction in the value of sterling. Already, their incomes and products are netting 10% or 12% less than they were before the Brexit vote. I am sorry our new Taoiseach has left the Chamber. I only hope that he did not leave because only the smaller groups or parties are here now and that when he had dealt with the larger ones, he decided to go. That would be wrong. He should recognise that we are elected also by the people who vote for us and who need their complaints and problems listened to. These small businesses are very worried that if the value of sterling persists at this low rate for a long time, and it is predicted that it could last for 20 years, it would have a savage adverse effect on the Twenty-six Counties. Those businesses are making no apology for saying it. Much of the talk in this House over the last number of months has been about making a special case for Northern Ireland. We are elected here to make a case for the Republic of Ireland, the Twenty-six Counties. In that regard, it is said that much traffic will go across the Border for cheaper goods. Down as far as a straight line from Galway to Dublin, and even down further than that, it will have a very negative impact and all the traffic will be inclined to go up to the North of Ireland. The counties in the South will suffer an awful lot. Those businesses are asking how that is going to be addressed. I mentioned this last night. They even suggested that Northern Ireland should have to join the euro. After all, if the Border is going to be at the ports, we will not have a level playing field with the sterling being so low in the Six Counties. We would lose much of our custom. Counties and people would suffer accordingly. With regard to the farming community, around the time of the election, the price for cattle dropped €100 per head. It is so volatile now that it dropped €100 per head when there was uncertainty and when Ms May lost so much of her vote in the setting up of a new government. We need to address those issues. I hope the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will do his best as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Government's team and our new Taoiseach will have to address all these issues. When one goes out the gate this evening, everything looks grand and rosy. There are tower cranes all over the place. However, the farther one goes towards the Atlantic the worse things are getting. Young people are coming to the greater Dublin area to work and are leaving rural Ireland behind. Let us take the Leader programme for example. There are 18 different stages of approval. Rural Ireland is being forgotten about and it is getting worse. As much as we have talked in this Chamber, it is deteriorating by the day. On those matters, such as the Leader funding, not a penny has been spent yet. I have gone into Deputy McGrath's time. More emphasis needs to be placed on rural Ireland when we are talking to the EU in the coming days.	spk_405
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-06-20	dail	32	Trade and Foreign Direct Investment: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_40	I thank Fianna Fáil for giving us the opportunity to discuss Brexit and the negative impact it will have, especially on small businesses, farmers and fishermen. Small business people who have come through the recession are already very concerned with the reduction in the value of sterling. It means their income is short by 10% or 12% currently and they are worried that if this continues indefinitely, it will blow them out of existence for all time. To that end, many of them are concerned by all the talk about Northern Ireland. While all of us, myself included, support a soft Border, they are very concerned that as this goes on, Northern Ireland will benefit as it will have lower costs and goods will be cheaper there, and the reduction in the value of sterling will create a mass exodus over the Border and deprive southern companies of the income they enjoyed heretofore. In that regard, they are asking whether we should be pushing this. While it is fine to support special exemptions for the North of Ireland, we need to look for certain things as well. They are asking is it possible that Northern Ireland should be asked to join the euro so we would have a level paying pitch. I suppose it makes a certain amount of sense. We need to explore that because if the value of sterling stays low for many years, it will ruin all of the southern Ireland and small business and farmers will suffer. Fishermen are at a crossroads in Kerry and south-west Cork. Something must be done to address the anomalies of the quotas, particularly the mackerel quota. It is not fair how it is meted out, with one side of the country getting 87% of the quota and the rest of the country getting just 13%. That matter needs to be addressed. We are at a crossroads. IBEC has told us that rural areas are going to suffer. If we can imagine rural areas are going to suffer more than they have already, it is going to be terrible. Many parts of rural Ireland have been decimated.It is fine up here in Dublin and it is said that urban areas will prosper further. We need to do something to address the imbalance as we see it from our side of the world.	spk_480

We do not know how long that will be but we hope everything goes well because people depend on them. The health system is a shambles and in need of a serious overhaul. The HSE does not seem to be accountable or providing value for money. As highlighted in the media a few days ago, one HSE manager is being paid €600,000 a year. This issue must be addressed because no man or woman in the country is worth that kind of money in any year for whatever job he or she does. Too many people are on waiting lists. Since my election, I and my brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, have been highlighting the cases of people waiting for cataract procedures. The position has still not improved and people are going blind. Youngsters and teenagers are waiting for four or five years for orthodontic treatment. Girls are embarrassed to go out and nearly too embarrassed to go to school because they are waiting for this treatment. It is too late when they are 17 or 18 years of age because their gums have hardened and the treatment does not have the positive effect it should have. People on the public list must wait for a year and a half or two years for a hip operation. Some of them are unable to sleep at night because they are waiting for operations, which is not fair or right. Two weeks ago, in the middle of summer, 17 or 18 people were on trolleys in Tralee University Hospital. What will happen in winter? Even in Cork University Hospital, people waiting for heart bypass operations have been sent home because no intensive care beds would have been available for them after surgery. That is not acceptable.	spk_215

Deer Lodge, a 40-bed mental health facility on St. Margaret's Road, was completed two years ago. Why have its doors not opened yet? I ask the Minister for Health to demand from the HSE that the facility be opened forthwith. It was completed two years ago and it is not fair to people with mental health problems that they are not allowed to use it. The St. Mary of the Angels home is a wonderful facility that is being shut down by stealth because no new patients are being admitted. This is not fair on those who were dealt a bad hand and are being prevented from using the facility. The decongregation model will have to be reviewed because one size does not fit all, as I have told the Minister previously. My blood boils when I hear the Minister say people can be moved from these facilities into the community. I know a person who was born 45 or 46 years ago and who is crumpled up in a little ball, cannot see, walk, talk or move his hands or legs. If the Minister is suggesting that this person can be moved into the community, he is away with the fairies. I ask him to review the decongregation model. People with physical and mental disabilities are not receiving enough help and assistance. Their parents have been dealt a hard hand and I ask the Minister to do more for them.

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-05-31	dail	32	Nursing Homes Support Scheme: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_50	"I am glad to speak here today to raise the unfairness in the fair deal scheme as it is currently being applied to family farms and small family businesses where the owners live in or above the small shop, post office, pub or other similar scenario. Justice delayed is justice denied. The farming community and these small businesses that I am talking about have been discriminated against on a daily basis, by this Government and by previous Governments. It is criminal what they are doing to the owners of small farms. The ordinary individual is asked to pay 7.5% of his or her family home for three years, that is, 22.5%, but it is an endless amount, 7.5% every year while he is in the nursing home, for the man with a farm, shop or pub. That is totally unfair to the young farmer coming up who is trying to carry on what generations did before him. The fact that, currently, the total value of the farm or shop is assessed when calculating how much these families have to pay means that many families have had to sell or will have to sell the asset from which they generate their income. In most cases family farms have been handed down from generation to generation. Instead of calling it a fair deal, it is actually a lousy deal to take the farm or business off them by this means to pay for the nursing home. The family farm makes a vital contribution to growth and employment in rural towns and villages, forming the backbone of the rural economy. This scheme has a disproportionate and fundamentally unfair impact on low-income farm families and any further dilution of the farm assets could make the farm unviable. Farmers are different from most people in Ireland in that they are often asset rich and cash poor. Their assets on paper are not an accurate reflection of their ability to pay. It is also common that the family home is centrally located on the farm and if this or part of the farm has to be sold to pay for the nursing home, it would reduce the viability and could mean the whole farm would have to be sold. Many farming families have this genuine worry. As we all know, farmers, almost all working alone, have to work hard. Many finish up in very bad shape and as a result, have to end their days in a nursing home. We are asking that 90% of the family farm or business be exempt from calculating what these families have to pay towards the fair deal scheme. I am asking the Government as well to honour the commitment in the programme for a partnership Government to remove the discrimination against small businesses and family farms. It should introduce a reduced charge on the farm business assets that would remove the uncertainty for farm families and the family employed which protects the future viability of the farm or business asset for the future generation. This would help to reduce the time an asset needs to be transferred prior to entering a nursing home from five to three years and provide immediate clarification on the definition of ""sudden illness or disability"".I am very worried about what the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, said earlier with regard to protecting the successful operation of the fair deal scheme and ensuring that it continues to afford access to nursing home care in a sustainable way. Surely that does not mean that farmers have to continue paying in the way they have been to date. That is totally and absolutely unfair. I am calling on all the rural Deputies in this House who are asking the farming community for votes, whether they are from Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or no party, to support this motion. I am not so sure about what the Government is proposing and I am worried about the fact it is not supporting our motion today. What we are proposing is fair play for the farming community and the small business owners who have been, and continue to be, discriminated against."	spk_474

People who are in pain and in need of procedures are not treated equally. Last Thursday evening - in the middle of the summer - there were 18 people on trolleys at Kerry General Hospital. As I have highlighted on many occasions, people have gone practically blind because they have been waiting two or three years to get cataract procedures. That is not fair or right in any democratic society. We have been told that this can be done much more quickly - in six to 12 weeks - under the Sligo model. Teenagers are having to wait four to five years to get orthodontic treatment. If they are 17, 18 or 19 by the time they get such treatment, their gums have gone too hard. The procedure does not work out and is not a success. On several occasions last year and earlier this year, people waiting for heart bypass surgery at Cork University Hospital were sent home and had to wait for up to five weeks. That is not right. People are waiting for a year, a year and a half or maybe two years for hip replacements. I would like to mention another anomaly that has been highlighted recently. Many people do not apply for a medical card until they get sick or have to go into hospital. They make an application when a problem arises and wait for four or five weeks for the card to be sanctioned. They have to pay the hospital bills that mount up in the meantime even though they qualify for a medical card. I suggest that in the case of someone who qualifies for a medical card, the card should be effective from the date of application. Not enough money is being spent on front-line staff. That needs to be addressed. A new building at the Deer Lodge mental health unit in Killarney was built two years ago to cater for 40 patients, but it has yet to be opened. What is happening? I have been told that during Fidel Castro's dictatorship in Cuba, a person who presented with a hip or heart problem could get an operation that week. All the world was giving out about the Castro dictatorship, but it had a better health service than the one we have here. I thank Deputy Kelleher for giving me this opportunity to raise these matters. The Government needs to get working because the current approach is a failure. Sick people need to be treated urgently.	spk_355
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-05-24	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach about impediments and blockages to housing in terms of people being refused planning permission to build houses for themselves. Many people are now being blocked at a pre-planning stage because of designations in the county development plans. There are areas of intense urban pressure, stronger areas and weaker areas. There could be a young man in an area under intense urban pressure who would not be considered for planning permission if he wanted to buy a house next door to where he is currently living. That matter has to be addressed. The planning guidelines are currently discriminating against many people, especially local people who wish to build a house for themselves. In Europe, it has been found that such discrimination is unfair and illegal. Will the Government address the planning guidelines? It is acting illegally in terms of the planning guidelines which it has given the local authorities. That matter has to be addressed.

I have it now. NAMA was set up by Government and when it was first set up, many thought it was a good idea. Many felt that if NAMA held on to property owned by people, companies or banks with financial problems for long enough, it would realise substantial funding for the State. There has not been enough transparency with NAMA. People ask me why NAMA has not sold any of the properties it controlled by public auction or public tender and why it sold many properties in bundles. When it does this, it rules out the small people and the people who have an interest in a certain property. It sells a lot of bundles together or bundles up a lot of properties together which deprives many people of the opportunity of buying. We all know when a certain property goes for sale at public auction and people are interested in it, they drive it on and drive it up, because there could be two or three interested bidders. If there are more properties included, which they are not interested in, they are not as likely to show interest and they may not have the finance to buy a bigger bundle of properties together.  I support and welcome instances in which companies that lost everything during the collapse are given the opportunity to buy back some or all of the properties they lost. They have worked hard to provide funding to buy back some of their properties. They had invested large sums, employed people and then lost much of what they owned when the market collapsed. I am glad some of these companies were able to buy back some of the properties they owned previously.  I am not sure the commission of investigation will provide anything positive, other than perhaps find out some of the things that should or should not have happened. I do not know how it will leave the country or economy financially better off. I hope the investigation does not go on forever. I hope, when its findings are published, we will wake up and realise that some of these inquiries, reports and tribunals are providing very little in the way of repaying taxpayers for what should or should not have happened, as the case may be. I am sceptical about the commission of investigation but I will go along with it until I see what it achieves. Many people are sceptical about commissioning more investigations, reports and tribunals because previous inquiries have not delivered many financial benefits for taxpayers. 	spk_344

Young drivers cannot get realistic quotes that they can afford to pay. I am of the belief that one should always give young people a chance at least until they blot their copybook. They are entitled to be treated fairly until that happens. They should at least get a chance and be allowed to start off. Young people need their cars, especially where we come from. There is no mode of transport in rural places other than a car and one needs to have a car of one's own. Many of these youngsters now cannot go to work because they cannot afford insurance. Likewise, old drivers are being penalised. Their quotes are being doubled. That is not fair and it makes no sense. Quotes for taxis and hackneys have gone up. The cost of their yearly premiums has gone up. I know of two cases in which the quote rose to €14,000. They could not come up with that kind of money and it forced them off the road. I will give one example in each case. I know of a haulier who paid €70,000 last year. This year, he is being quoted €250,000. That is the truth. Youngsters of 21 years of age are being asked to pay €4,000 and €5,000. They cannot afford that. Returning to old people, I know of one man who never had a crash in his life. His insurance went up from €340 to €780. He has actually paid it. I know another man who was a bit luckier. His quote went a way up as well from around €300 to more than €700. He went along and told his son about it. His son had a lot of vehicles and could not believe the figure his father was being quoted. The son went along to the insurance company or broker and asked how his father was being charged so much. The response was, ""Oh, is he your father?"". This is a fact. The son said that it was his father and the company said to leave it with them. They came back after a few hours and said that his premium would be the same next year. That tells me that something is going on and that insurance companies are not being honest. There is a huge increase in claims and the value of claims. There are companies out there especially putting claims together for solicitors. Claimants cannot lose because the legal profession operates on the basis of ""no foal, no fee"". They cannot lose. Why is it that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is only dealing with 20% of the claims? For a serious case of whiplash in England, the maximum payout a claimant can get is £7,600. For a very minor one here, a claimant will get €18,400. For a serious one, a claimant will get €77,000. A girl got €76,000 for her finger being caught in a door. The solicitor got €47,000 of that. I will not say where it was, but another solicitor boasted that he got €80,000 for such a claim and said that if others have similar cases, he can get that money for them too. A fella who slipped on a wet floor when he was actually pushed, for some reason or other - I cannot understand it - got €750,000. I have said it before that the fraud squad or some special investigation unit should be put into action to follow these things up because this is what is causing much of the increases, or at least this is what we are being told is the cause of the increase in quotes and premiums for the young, the old and the business people I mentioned. If we go back about 14 years, we had the same scenario in this country. People could not afford insurance because it had become very expensive at that time. I know that because my oldest two lads were coming on the scene at the time and I could not insure them on their own. I had to insure them on an old jeep I had and put them on my insurance. That is a fact. We do not have enough competition in the insurance market at present. I will say categorically that while Seán Quinn was operating we could pay for insurance. Sadly, he has been taken out of it. People could get insurance and when he was there, they could pay for it. He was taken out but he would have paid his way back. The bankers who broke the country were let off and they got away with it. Deputy Boyd Barrett brought the issue of health insurance to my attention and I agree with him. How is it if a person is in hospital for two or three days, he or she is liable to pay about €75 a night for his or her stay yet if he or she has VHI the hospital will take a fee of €800 or €850 from VHI for the same stay? Why is that happening? It is the HSE that is doing it. It is driving up the cost of private health cover. That should be investigated. It is happening everywhere. Regardless of what hospital it is, it is happening and it is unfair because, at the end of the day, it is the public that has to pay for it. We are raising all these issues in respect of the cost of insurance with the Minister of State, and I have done so since I came here. Something needs to be done. The Government should have a role to play when someone has been refused insurance or when someone is given an exorbitant quote he or she cannot pay. The Government or some independent body should have the power to ask why that is the case because it is totally unfair. It is the most common thing we are asked at our clinics and especially when we meet youngsters. They are trying to get going and want to get out in the world but they are being prevented from doing that. There must be more competition in the market and the Government must investigate further to ensure companies are acting fairly because I do not believe they are at present."	spk_368

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-05-16	dail	32	Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_32	"I am pleased to speak to the Bill as it deals with a matter that affected many people when they presented at a hospital and the right result was not achieved for them. This is an issue that does and will continue to affect many. As the Minister mentioned, open disclosure is about an open, honest and consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in health care. The open disclosure process should include keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the incident. It may also include, depending on the particular circumstances involved, an apology for what happened. I note that the Minister first announced his intention to push forward legislation to enforce a medical negligence open disclosure policy in an address to delegates at the State Claims Agency's first annual quality, patient safety and clinical risk conference at Dublin Castle in September 2016. It is a fact that many involved in the legal profession make a great deal of money out of cases where people make a claim to obtain redress because things had gone wrong in hospital, something should not have happened to them and, in some cases, lives were lost or people were hurt and the right result was not achieved. The Minister also said at the event that the establishment of a new national patient safety office would ""lead a programme of significant patient safety measures"" that would include a review of how adverse medical events were disclosed to patients and their families and the process for claiming medical negligence compensation. I would be worried if this were to be another governance arm set up in the HSE where we would have to depend on the HSE to tell the patients about their rights. An independent body should be monitoring this area. It should not be another job handed to the HSE to correct itself or check what happened. I would not trust it in that scenario. It must be an independent body to monitor this area. I note that A Programme for a Partnership Government also makes it clear that open disclosure is an essential component of patient safety and commits to measures to support it. The programme also states it will be made mandatory to report specified patient safety incidents or serious reportable events to the authorities and the patient harmed. That is certainly necessary. The general scheme of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill also has provisions on voluntary external reporting of non-serious incidents to the States Claims Agency, supporting and complementing the current reporting process to the agency. However, it is not proposed to legislate for mandatory open disclosure to patients. That is wrong. That is what we should be hoping to achieve in the Bill, that there would be mandatory open disclosure and that doctors, nurses, matrons or whoever makes a mistake or an error would come clean and tell patients or their families what had happened. That is what this is about. It appears that doctors and others involved in the medical profession are prevented by the HSE from disclosing to patients what happened in different cases. That is wrong. This measure should legislate for mandatory open disclosure to patients. We are told the reason it is not proposed to legislate for this is related to creating the positive voluntary climate for open disclosure laid out in the Madden report and which will be reviewed in line with experience to see whether it needs to be strengthened and how, if necessary, that could best be done. I do not trust that aspect of the Bill In Australia one of the central principles of open disclosure policies involves the presence of good governance and the insistence that quality assurance requires organisations to be able to demonstrate that they learn and improve their performance through continuous monitoring and by reviewing the systems and processes in place for meeting their objectives and delivering appropriate outcomes. Can we hold out any great hope the HSE will be capable of demonstrating that approach? As the Australian model of open disclosure also notes, health care organisations need to ensure appropriate direction and internal control through a system of governance. It is imperative that each facility and its management show the capacity and a willingness to learn from adverse events. As noble as the aim is and as good as the principle is, do we really need to go about creating an additional level of governance within the HSE? How can we prevent the difficulties that will go along with it? I welcome the principle of the Bill, but I have serious concerns about the capacity of the HSE to carry it through. There is a need for a radical change in its culture first. We all know about the serious events where the lives of family members have been lost, where family members have been left with serious disabilities, where babies have been left with serious disabilities caused by negligence during childbirth and where mothers, likewise, have suffered during childbirth. Doctors and nurses know at that point that they have slipped up and it would be much easier if they were allowed to come clean. I know that most of them would, but they are prevented from doing so by their organisation, the HSE. I refer to people who have lost a family member, a father or a mother, the breadwinner in the family, because cancer was not diagnosed in time. Men and women have lost their lives because a heart complaint was not diagnosed. Sadly, after spending days in hospital, when it should have been detected, they died. Someone has to be held to account. Someone must be accountable when something dreadful like that happens and family life as they knew it is finished forever. In cases where the breadwinner dies the wife and children will suffer for years and never recover following their loss. I know of one hospital which I will not name where six lives were lost in the space of two months. They lost their lives because they had developed clots as their complaints were not addressed when they presented at the hospital. I know about these incidents because I was very close to one of the people concerned. That is not right. I know that the doctors and nurses involved knew that things were not right and that they would have come clean, but the system in place does not allow them to do so. A lot of money has been lost in the courts with mounting legal costs. When an award is made, a percentage of it goes directly to the legal profession, including barristers and solicitors; that money could be used to pay damages to many people to give them some retribution, while freeing the courts to deal with other business."	spk_339
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-05-16	dail	32	Equal Participation in Schools Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_33	We are elected here to represent all of the people. While I am here, I will always strive to do that fairly. I am a Catholic and I am not ashamed to say that. I believe, however, that all people of other religious views are entitled to those views. I respect their views but I want to be respected, too. Since I came here, however, there has been a continuous onslaught against the Catholic religion and not against any other religion. While I am not saying there should be an attack on any other religion, this racket needs to be curtailed and stopped. Fair play needs to be given to the people we are representing because, when one is hitting at the Catholic religion, one is hitting at an awful lot of people. The proposal in this Bill is to get rid of the Catholic ethos in all schools. The reason being given is that children have to be baptised before they are admitted to school. In the county of Kerry, from where I come, I have not had one complaint about that from parents, teachers or others. We are glad to have many families, including children, from many other parts of the world, especially in Killarney and Tralee. We have not had one complaint. Neither I nor any other member of our outfit has had one complaint to the effect that children were being deprived of a place or could not gain access to a school because of their not having been baptised in the Catholic religion. I know there have been many unsavoury incidents in schools in the past. Nuns and brothers were found to be responsible. I would never condone that. The State, however, had a role to play also. In those times, there was a Minister for Education and a Department of Education. They do not seem to get the same blame at all as the people who were involved. In every outfit, one had a boss, and the Minister for Education and the Department in those times were equally responsible for letting those things happen. I take this opportunity, however, to note that we have to appreciate brothers and nuns who played a very positive role in the education of the people of this country in the past and who do so even in the present. I went to the Presentation convent in Kenmare for a few years and I really appreciate and recognise the great work that was done there by the Poor Clare nuns. I will always think of them and thank them for the time and effort they devoted to all of the children. They treated all of the children fairly and equally. Many parents hold the Catholic religion very close to their hearts. They still want their children brought up in the Catholic ethos and they make no apology for asking for this or doing it. I recognise the great work being done by management and teachers in all the schools in Killarney, Tralee, Castleisland, Kenmare, Killorglin, Caherciveen and all the rural schools around the county. I take this opportunity to mention one school, in Tahilla, where there are only about 20 children. Thirteen of them are of 13 different nationalities and, I believe, they may have 13 different religious views. They are all being accommodated and treated fairly and equally in that school and have been for many years. That part of the country attracts people from many different countries because of its natural beauty and views. Many important people have come to live there and sent their children to the local schools. We appreciate the attention the teachers and management have given to those families all the time. I raised with the Minister a problem in Kerry in regard to access to schools. Since the last Government and the current one came into office, they have deprived many children in rural communities of the opportunity of attending their own local school.There are different places like Cordal, Knocknagoshel, Brosna, Kilgarvan, Blackwater, Sneem, Tahilla, Annascaul and Lispole in north Kerry. They are being deprived of the opportunity to go to the local school their parents went to because the Government took away the school transport. School transport was promised when the outlying schools in the hills and the valleys closed. An undertaking was given by the Department in 1956 that children would always be transported free of charge to the local central school. I remind the Minister that is not happening. Children in Scartaglin parish who are entitled to go to Scartaglin school have to go to another school because free school transport is not available to take them to the school in their own parish which happens to be further away than a school in another parish. They find themselves going to school in the other parish. I ask the Minister and the Government to address that issue because a word is a word and that word was given as far back as 1956 that children from those areas would be taken to their local school free of charge. The Government has reneged on that and I am sorry about that because it has hurt many families.	spk_359

We have all said it, but the Ceann Comhairle called this the most serious matter to confront the country in a very long time. IBEC and other organisations, including the IFA, claim it will impact more on rural areas than on cities and greater urban areas.If we think of how things were in the period before we joined the EU, although they have improved a lot since then, many of our youngsters were emigrating at that time and there seemed to be no good outlook for farming. I feel that if these negotiations go wrong, a bigger exodus of young fellows will leave the land than ever before, leaving many places totally abandoned, without life at all. The rural hills, glens and valleys right around the county of Kerry and across all of the country - the very rural places - have enough to do just to survive at present. When farmers hand down to their sons, it is a burden around a young fellow's shoulders to carry on with the farm and hope to hand it down to the next generation after him, like his father handed it down to him. With regard to the market for beef, as Deputy Harty said, 50% of our exports go to Britain and we import a large amount from Britain. If anything was to happen to that market, it would be a disaster for the people trying to survive on farms here. Likewise, fishermen are very concerned that if the UK takes back its territorial waters, it will put more pressure on them because big factory ships from Spain and other countries will catch more in our waters and clean out our fishermen and leave them with no income at all. Small manufacturers have already been adversely impacted upon in that the value of sterling has fallen and they are operating at margins that are 10% less than before the Brexit vote. That is really hurting them. I am glad the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is present to listen to the debate. I heard him on radio the other night. He gave a good account of himself and had a good grasp of what needs to be done and the fight that has be fought in the days and weeks ahead. The Border between the North and South is a big concern for many people who cross it on a daily basis. If we are to return to the days of a hard Border and customs and tariffs, it will be a disaster. I am concerned about the part of the statement issued by the Council, which made the following point, ""The United Kingdom's decision to leave the Union creates significant uncertainties that have the potential to cause disruption, in particular in the United Kingdom but also, to a lesser extent, in other Member States."" I think that statement is wrong. This will have much more of an adverse impact on a country like Ireland than on the United Kingdom, which is a strong country that has the ability to do deals with other nations and find markets all over the world, and which is closer to mainland Europe. We are very isolated because we are surrounded by water. This will impact very hard on rural areas, in particular small farmers. I appeal to the Minister to leave no stone unturned in ensuring we come as good as we can out of this because I fear it will be very bad for the country."	spk_381
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-05-09	dail	32	Proposed Sale of AIB Shares: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_29	I am glad of the opportunity to talk on this important motion. On the one hand, the sale of AIB to reduce our debt is laudable, but where does this leave the surety of a bank service for the people in rural sparsely populated areas? If the new owners decide to take banks out of rural towns, what will the people do then? They will have to travel longer journeys. The people have stood by this bank in good times and bad. Will the people, account holders, borrowers, mortgage holders and all who trade with the new owners get fair play? This is the most important aspect. The people we represent are the most important. I believe there is not enough competition in the banking business to ensure that interest rates remain at an acceptable level. Will our farmers and small business people get loans to keep their businesses going? This move could very well suit big business and millionaires at the cost or expense of smaller operators and entrepreneurs who are trying to get going.The sum of €3 billion is a big figure on the one hand but, if an entity or someone else can see the sense in buying AIB, surely this Government should see that the bank has started making money and that it could make money for the taxpayer also. Most importantly, we are losing control for the Irish people. We do not have enough banks to ensure competition. I, too, would like more and better infrastructure in our country. This Government, and all the parties here, should be going back to those in Europe and telling them that we will pay them what we owe them when we have it. It should not be putting this generation under the pressure it is putting it under. Employers, sole traders and anyone going out working in the morning are being taxed too high and not getting services for it. I am asking the Government to go back with its cap in its hand to tell the Germans, who did not pay their debt following the First World War until approximately three years ago, that we will pay them when we have it. When small businesses tell us they cannot pay us this year but will pay us next year, we accept it. This is what we should be about and not selling the one bank that we have control over. It is very wrong. The Government would want to think about it again. I am asking it of Fianna Fáil as well. It is not doing right by the Irish people to sell this bank. Go back to those in Europe and tell them that we are paying too much but that we will pay them when we have it.	spk_411
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-05-03	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	The programme for Government supports the transfer of landholdings from older farmers down to the younger generation. However, in recent times the farming courses by which farmers obtain green certificates are being intensified and lengthened. This is fine if a young fella is coming into a big farm or a farm that is economically viable. He will survive on that landholding with that farming enterprise. However, in rural areas, a lot of the young fellas are coming into smaller landholdings with a few sheep and a few cattle. They need to hold down another job. In these cases, I ask that these young farmers should not have to go through as much as the fellas that are in more intensive farming situations. This needs to be looked at because it is very hard on many young fellas.	spk_64

We need a modern hospital for mothers and children-to-be, built to the best standards in the world because the people of Ireland are entitled to it. I heard Deputy Michael Harty call for the maternity hospital to be co-located with St. Vincent's University Hospital, but I would have thought the maternity and children hospitals should have been co-located, although somewhere more accessible than where the children's hospital is to be built at St. James's Hospital. Many would have thought that the edge of the M50 or the site of Connolly Hospital would have been more suitable. I am also of that view because there are deficiencies at St. James's Hospital in terms of access and parking facilities, among other things. This issue has gone on for long enough and the hospital needs to proceed to construction stage as soon as possible. We look forward to the new national maternity hospital being built as soon as possible. The timeline is three or four years, but that seems long when one considers the state of the hospital on Holles Street which is clearly not fit for purpose, has outgrown its suitability and needs to be replaced.	spk_260

We need to know how many people were prosecuted in the wrong. They must have the fines returned and their characters restored before I will vote for anything like this. This Bill is intended to protect fish stocks, which is a goal I support. I support fishing, the tourism product it creates and the people it brings in. However, that is not its effect. The Bill will ensure that more landowners and farmers are prevented from taking anything out of the rivers they and their forefathers protected and kept clear. All of our rivers are blocked. It is each and every one of them. The Flesk and all other rivers in mid-Kerry are blocked and choked and no farmer can touch them because of what is termed ""cost compliance"". If Inland Fisheries Ireland officials come upon a farmer, he or she will lose payments which is enough to deter anyone from going near a river and clearing it out. They are all blocked. We are told the Shannon has not been cleaned out since the 19th century when it was done by the British. We are now talking about building walls, banks and flood defences at a cost of millions while, as Deputy Mattie McGrath says, consultants are paid to carry out report after report. If there was some way to jack up the houses and roads, that is what we would be told to do. That cannot be done, however. Nevertheless, the Government is insisting that one road in Kerry must be raised but it will realise when it tries it that houses further along will be flooded if it is done. That is in the Flesk valley and the Government will not get away with it. I am very sad also that Deputy Mick Wallace blamed farmers here tonight. I know only too well how much money farmers have spent over the years to build slatted tanks and to comply with the nitrates regulations and directives. It was very unfair of him. I would much prefer if he were here when I mention his name but I do not see him. It was very wrong of him to blame farmers for reduced fish stocks in our rivers because the fact is that it is the factory ships in the bays that are cleaning the whole thing out. The fish cannot come up. They cannot get near the Flesk, Roughty or Sheen rivers in Kerry because they are stopped in the bay by factory ships that can clean everything out in one hour. Why does the Government not do something about that and prosecute those fellows given that it is where the problem is? We have to tell the truth about this. Fish will not survive where rivers are closed in with bushes because they need sunlight, but that is not being recognised or dealt with at all. Most of our rivers are covered in with the bushes from both sides meeting in the middle. The fish cannot see any daylight, which is another reason they are not as plentiful as they were in times gone by. I do not accept either the remarks Deputy Wallace made about septic tanks because I know how strict local authorities are in granting planning permissions to young couples trying to put roofs over their heads. They must go through many hoops to build those septic tanks. There may be a few here and there but they are not the cause of the problem as he is outlining it. As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, previous Governments denied local authorities the funding to bring their treatment plants up to scratch. It was supposed to happen in 2008 and 2009 and we were going to be fined €500,000 in each case by Europe. Local authority members voted to increase levies because of it but it has not happened. The sewage is still flowing into the rivers and seas from towns and villages. Why does the Government not deal with that? That is how it would see the thing coming right again after a few years but it will not do it. It continues to perch on the vulnerable, namely, farmers and the young couples installing septic tanks at their own cost and to a certain standard. It is very unfair to blame them and many others like them. I will not vote for the Bill until the Government makes some attempt to return money to the people it fined and to the farmers it frightened from their own rivers, denying them to right to clear rivers and causing the whole place to be flooded. The country is flooded because our rivers are full to the brim. Some consultants suggest raising the banks and building walls and defences, which is a cod. The Government is not fooling me and it will not fool the people. The rivers need to be cleaned out but the Government is ensuring it will fine anyone who goes near them. Doing good is what it is at."	spk_283
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-05-02	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I wish to raise a matter of unfairness and the non-delivery of vital services in Kerry. I refer to cataracts. It is neither fair nor right that people of all ages have to wait for two or three years for a procedure. I will outline a couple of examples to the House. An 85-year old man, who is perfect in every way and is caring for his wife, needs a car to go to a shop and bring himself and his wife to mass but can no longer drive because he has been waiting over 18 months for an operation. He feels it would not be safe for him to drive and his car has been parked in a field. A 70-year old man who has had a disability for over 40 years had to sell the only thing he had in the world, his vintage car, for €4,500. He had been waiting for a year and a half for an operation and could not bear the fact that he could not see the television and watch the nine o'clock news and some other programmes. He is living alone and had to sell his vintage car to have an operation privately in order to restore his sight back to a reasonable level. A 62-year old man had to give up work because he was waiting for over two years to get one eye operated on. He now believes he has lost his sight in the second eye and is very depressed. That is what is happening with regard to cataracts in Kerry. Teenagers have to wait four or five years for orthodontic treatment. Girls, in particular, are too embarrassed to socialise and are only barely able to go to school or college. In many cases they have lost their confidence. When treatment is carried out at the age of 17 or 18 years of age their gums are tough and the procedure is not as successful as it would be if carried out sooner. We do not have nearly enough funding for home help. Few people, if any, get home help at weekends. This weekend was a long weekend due to the public holiday on Monday and, therefore, people went for three days without home help.The people I am talking about do not get better at the weekend. They do not rise like Lazarus and go to a function or a ball because they are still in the same fix on Saturday and Sunday as they were on the other five days of the week. They need proper funding to be seen at weekends also. Many of these people are living alone and do not have any family. The Government has five ministerial office holders in the Department of Health and gave €950 million more to the HSE this year, or so it says, but things have not improved in these three areas.

The people of Kerry are just as entitled to their sight as those from any other part of the country. We told the Taoiseach about the Sligo model where someone who presents with a need for regular treatment will be seen in six weeks. If it is more serious, they will be seen after that in 12 weeks and if it is more serious again, they will be seen after six weeks. Why can we not have that model in Cork and Kerry? Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has raised this several times and it must be more of a problem in Kerry because I do not hear Deputies from any other part of the country bringing it up. Home help hours are not being provided on Saturday and Sunday and I do not want any more figures from the Taoiseach on that. They did not get hours on the bank holiday Monday just gone and they have not got them on any other bank holiday Monday, which is not fair.The Taoiseach states it is up to the local manager, but local managers tell us they do not have the funding. There is a Minister and four Ministers of State with responsibility for health. Get them to check it out and see what is happening. Money has been given to the HSE but we are not seeing results. The Government and Ministers with responsibility for health should ensure these services are given to the people fairly and that they are looked after properly.	spk_39

I have highlighted this in Kerry many times. We have a wonderful new facility which in June will be complete and fully built for two years but is still not open. Public representatives and many others were taken on a tour of this wonderful building. It is a state-of-the-art building but, sadly, it still has not been opened. We have a Government and five Ministers with responsibility for health. I ask one of them to unblock whatever is causing this building not to be opened. We are not giving people with mental health problems the service they require or looking after them properly when this building is not opened. It is to service all of east Kerry and much of north Kerry. I also ask that the special purpose building to be built at University Hospital Kerry in Tralee be put in place. We have been asked by the people to provide these facilities. I ask again that the building on St. Margaret's Road, which was completed two years ago and is still not opened, be opened right away. Either we have a Minister for Health who is in charge of health and does something about this, or he is not in charge at all. We were guaranteed money to open it in January but it is still not opened. I am afraid it will not be open this time next year if some Minister does not take command and control and states it must be opened and no two ways about it. I have asked many times about it, as has Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, but nothing has happened and it is still closed. Next Friday night we will have all of the wonderful people out on the Darkness into Light walk to collect funds to help people, and they will do a great service by doing the walk. It is a unified approach because, as Deputy Collins said, every family has been touched by mental health issues or the loss of someone through suicide. I ask the Government to ensure Deer Lodge on St. Margaret's Road, which cost millions of euro and is lying empty, be opened right away and that one of the five Ministers takes charge of it and ensures this happens.	spk_410

She has put a lot of work into it. It is a great evening to be an elected Member of this Dáil given the unanimity on the motion. The birth of a baby, whether born prematurely or at the correct time, is a joy and a wonder. It is a treasure for the parents to see a young baby come into the world. Today is a positive day given that we are speaking about protecting and saving a 23 week old baby rather than having motions and attempts to provide for abortion and getting rid of a little baby at that very same age. Parents who have a premature baby experience an emotional pressure as they hope and pray for the baby to live. There is also a financial pressure. We must look at the law as it is and ensure that parents are supported and mothers are given the time to recover at home and bond with their baby, which is very important. It was very moving to see the slide in the AV room today of Baby Patrick who was born perhaps only 1 lb in weight. That baby lived and is now three years old.

While they can opt for the one-stage process, in reality they cannot because if they opt for the one-stage process and any extra costs arise, the local authorities have to foot that bill. Therefore, they will not opt for that in the way that it was hoped to be operated. The Government has announced millions and millions of euro several times and yet very little has been built.

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-04-04	dail	32	Brexit: Statements	dbsect_29	I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this very serious and important matter facing our country. At a presentation in Buswells, IBEC informed us this will seriously affect the regions, as it calls them - I call them rural areas and the farming community - but it may not affect areas around Dublin as much. As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, I do not know how we can avoid a hard border, but I hope we can. We need our best team to take into account all the ways farmers will be affected if we do not maintain the markets we have had up to now, or at least to maintain most of them. The farming industry is at a crossroads. It will be very hard to maintain farming as we know it where farmers were proud to hand down the farm to their offspring and for them to continue to do the same. There will be a burden on their shoulders to do just that. They need every support. We need to maintain trade with the UK. As other Deputies stated, we will be severely affected if we have a hard border and cannot maintain the free travel area. I do not know how it will be achieved. We talk about Gibraltar and other places but will Europe and England listen? The English people voted to protect their borders. Given that Ireland is open to Europe, will we have people coming here to try to access Great Britain by crossing over the Border? There are many challenges to be dealt with and much work needs to be done. I am asking that our best team goes out and puts its best foot forward to ensure our interests are protected as much as possible in the upcoming talks. This evening we had a presentation from fishermen. They say that if the UK takes back its waters, European fishermen such as the Spaniards will impinge more on our waters and further abuse the ability of our fishermen to survive in places such as Castletownbere, Killybegs in County Donegal and off the Dingle coast. Those people will have a much harder time if this happens. An awful lot is involved and much is at stake for our country. As I stated, we are at a crossroads. Farmers are worried that we will lose the UK market. If the UK starts buying food or produce from other countries, farmers' ability to stay on the land will be eroded and rural areas that are struggling to survive will be further decimated. We cannot highlight enough the way farmers and those in rural communities will be hit. As it is, places are very badly hit. Down around the Ring of Kerry, many of the local parishes cannot field a team. They have to amalgamate to put a team out.	spk_467

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-03-30	dail	32	Direct Provision: Statements	dbsect_2	It is very difficult to know what is going on. The Government has stated it will accept refugees. I asked what agency will deal with the people involved and where they will be housed. It was stated that local authorities would be responsible for housing the refugees concerned. The local authority for which I worked for many years does not have the required houses, facility or staff to deal with refugees and no extra staff have been deployed to cater for them. The refugees we have agreed to accept and those in direct provision are all human beings. It is not right for a mother, father, teenagers and babies to be living in one room. An asylum seeker could be in the country for seven, eight or nine years, but all they are entitled to is €19.10 a week, which is not right. It was promised that the direct provision system would cease and the time involved in deciding on a person's status reduced. Many people have been waiting for eight or nine years, which is not right and should not be happening. A limit of five years was promised to decide whether a person can stay or must leave the country. I ask that the system be reviewed. Having one family in one room, in particular those with growing children, is not right. We have to deal with the issue. Those involved are human beings. It is grand to hear the Taoiseach agree to accept 4,000 or 5,000 refugees, but he must make provision for them in terms of housing. Local authorities are stretched. Some people in Kerry have been on housing lists for 12 or 14 years, some of whom were refugees or asylum seekers. They must get priority. If we are agreeing to accept refugees this year, the Government needs to tell us where housing is available and have a dedicated group of housing officers in place.  Staff in our local authority are vetting people and trying to find houses for them. They are stretched to the bone without having any more work placed on their shoulders. Those who have been on housing lists for 12 or 14 years will suffer and have to wait longer.	spk_40

Parents will inevitably have to bring children from faraway places like Valentia, Slea Head, Ballybunion, Lauragh, Cahermore, the area west of Castletownbere, Sneem and many other places. Nine out of every ten children will have to come in by the M50. Of course, there will be problems for doctors, nurses and staff getting to work and parking at St. James's. From what we can see, there was no proper consultation with the ambulance services. The situation with the helicopters was mentioned. The biggest and best helicopters should be able to land at St. James's but that will not be the case. I was in Lissivigeen the other evening, where there was a car crash and the patient was to be taken to Cork but, because of the wind, the helicopter had to take him to Limerick instead. We can imagine how, all along the west coast, which is windy nearly all the time, the largest helicopter would be needed to pick up child patients to bring them to Dublin but that helicopter will not be able to land. Will there have to be a transfer and where will the helicopter land with the patient? We were told first that the hospital was to cost €400 million and it is now €1.2 billion. The reason for the increase is not the reason which was given, namely, the increase in interest rates. I believe the cost only became apparent when the construction companies were asked to tender to build the building. When they worked out their prices, they had to take into account the access constraints, such as the trouble to get materials in and out, the problems for lorries trying to bring in ready-mix and traffic management, which will be a savage problem. Opening times will be restricted because of the residential properties such as houses and flats all around the site. A contractor will not be able to start work at a time he would like. He cannot start at 6 o'clock in the morning and stay working until 8 o'clock in the evening because he will not be allowed to do so.People locally will not let that happen because it will keep children and elderly people awake. With regard to the timescale, I believe that it will take much longer and cost much more than what has even been suggested today. The site will prove to be the most difficult in terms of access and in terms of the hours that the builders will actually be allowed to work. If the building did not start for three more years on the greenfield site, I believe it would still be finished before St. James's, if that is where the hospital will end up being built.	spk_250

The same is true of the Citizens Information centres, dealing with all the new rules and regulations for social welfare payments. They always gave prompt and accurate information to vulnerable people. How does the Minister expect that reducing the number of centres or companies from 93 to 16 will provide a service to people in rural areas? I say without fear of contradiction if this happens the rural areas will be worst affected. Reconfiguration of services means reduction of service. No one ever complained about the service from MABS or the CICs.	spk_572

I ask that the €1,000 taken from farmers in disadvantaged areas be restored to farmers who badly miss and need this money because they are struggling.

He came across the hallway, shook hands with me, smiled and congratulated me on getting elected and becoming a Member of Dáil Éireann. Regarding the matter under discussion, every man and woman is outraged about what has been made known about Tuam and what happened to so many small babies in that mother and baby home as well as other homes, institutions and laundries throughout the country. People want to know what happened. Were these children starved? How were they treated when they got sick? If they had something that was contagious, were they kept away from the rest of the children? The good, honest people want to know whether anyone can be brought to account for the wrongs that were done to so many children and young women. Deputies should not be haggling over which amendment to support. The Garda has a role to play in getting to the truth to ensure everything about what happened to the victims is made clear and, if possible, all the survivors are compensated properly. This is a sad saga in our history. It was considered shameful for an unmarried girl to become pregnant, requiring her to disappear from view locally into what was known as a mother and baby home or an industrial school. All Deputies should ensure the Garda is doing what it should do, that is, investigate and bring people to account where possible. We must work together to ensure all those who were wronged in these homes and institutions and are still alive get some form of redress or compensation.	spk_368

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-03-08	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_3	I welcome Vera Twomey and her husband to the Gallery this afternoon. I am glad to get this opportunity to highlight the lack of provision of jobs, infrastructure and services in Kerry. We cannot attract jobs and investment into our county because we simply do not have proper access. We have been waiting for the Macroom bypass for more than 40 years. We do not have adequate broadband or mobile phone coverage in many parts of our county. Many roads are substandard. To mention just a few, the roads from Blackwater Bridge to Sneem, Killarney to Gneevgullia and those around Scartaglen are in a desperate state. The Rathmore to Killarney road, a national secondary road, is in a desperate state. Many roads in north Kerry around Ballyduff, Kilmoyly, Lixnaw and Abbeydorney are in a desperate state. Many of our bridges are not fit for purpose, allowing only one lane for heavy traffic. Listry, Curraheen and the Caragh bridges were built more than 200 years ago. Funding for local improvement schemes has been suspended since 2011. Of these, 123 were approved in 2007 and there are in excess of 600 waiting to be assessed by Kerry County Council. The people on these roads in Kerry are as much entitled to a good road to their doors as the people in Dublin 4. These are all public roads, contrary to what the Department and others claim. Many of them were actually built by the local authority. Seven years’ shortfall in funding for maintenance means that many roads are waterlogged and ponding makes many of them unsafe in wet weather. We do not have enough money now to fill the potholes. Many roadside hedges are not being cut and none will be cut until 1 September, meaning that all the spring and summer growth will not be touched until then. It is a health and safety matter. Whatever about the birds and inside the ditches, all roadside hedges should be cut all year round. Many areas have suffered huge job losses, such as Castleisland, Kenmare, Cahersiveen and Tralee. All of north Kerry would benefit if the Shannon LNG project was allowed to go ahead by the regulator over whom nobody seems to have control. Rural Kerry has been affected by cuts of 53% to the Leader programme. Worse still, we have had no programme since 2013. Restrictive planning guidelines are preventing young people from putting a roof over their heads. Many towns and villages do not have any public sewerage scheme. One third of Castleisland has been waiting more than 30 years to be connected to the public sewerage system. Kilcummin has been waiting more than 20 years when it has been promised many times. Scartaglen, Curragh, Caherdaniel, Castlecove and Cloghane all have no public sewerage systems with health and safety compromised. Many people are trapped in their homes due to rural isolation. The proposal by the Government to reduce the alcohol limit further will impact adversely on people in rural areas. It is a big difference for these people from those in urban areas. Many people in rural areas would not get to know their neighbours were dead if it were not for Radio Kerry. In spite of all these impediments, Kerry and Kerry people are still the best in the world and everyone is still welcome to Kerry at all times.	spk_109

I must point out that 41% of the economic activity in the country is taking place in Dublin. This means the remaining 59% is taking place throughout the rest of the country. As a man from the west and coming from County Mayo, which has the same topography as County Kerry, the Taoiseach should know well that the people of my county are suffering. I want to tell about the Kilcummin Road, on which he travels on his way up and down to his holiday home. We cannot resurface it because we are waiting for the sewerage scheme to be done and we have been waiting for that for more than 20 years. The Taoiseach has surely seen the state of that road. A terrible wrong is being done to the people who have made applications under the local improvement scheme. These are public rather than private roads and there are no gates across them. They were built by the local authorities many years ago but they were not taken in charge and these people are being denied the right to have a good road leading to their door. I must comment further on the hedges. The hedges on the outside of the ditches should be cut along every road. There is plenty of room for the birds and everything else on the inside of the ditches. I would not mind if the hedges on the inside of the ditches all across the country were never cut but the hedges along the roads must be cut for the safety of people walking, cycling and driving. I ask all those in government to put their shoulder to the wheel and ensure that this matter is rectified.	spk_116

There is an urgent need for many more special needs teachers in the small national schools around the country. As larger schools have special needs teachers, the child with special needs from a family of course tends to go to that school and the rest of the family follows. That means they pass a small school nearer to them, which eventually closes because children tend to go to the school their special needs siblings attend. There is another issue in rural Ireland that needs to be addressed. When rural schools were closed, a promise was given that the children would always be transported for free to the nearest central school in the parish. That is not happening. Since 2012, the last Government and this Government have furthered a policy by which the children will only get transport to the nearest school, which may be in a different parish. That is not fair because families want to keep their parish identities and want their children to go to the local schools. Where the parents went, they want to children to follow. This must be addressed. There are many such situations in Cordal, Scartaglin, Anascaul, Tralee and Dingle. All of those places are affected. In Knocknagashel, there are more families affected. The Government did not honour the promise given that the children would be taken to the school in their own parish. There is no need in Kerry for the education Bill the Minister is bringing through. There is no requirement for a child to be baptised to be allowed into any of the schools that I know in Kerry. It is not a requirement that they have to produce a baptismal certificate. All denominations and all children from whatever country they come from are allowed in to each of our national schools. Our schools and parent-teacher committees need to be applauded for that because they do not segregate anyone. They give all children a chance to be admitted to their schools. I know one very small national school at the present time in which there are children from 13 different nationalities and there was never a requirement that they had to produce a baptismal certificate.	spk_437
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-03-08	dail	32	Health (Amendment) Bill 2017: Second Stage	dbsect_34	I too welcome the Bill to ensure children who are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance receive a medical card automatically.It is well known that parents with responsibility for a very sick child, who will be sick for many years, have enough to do and have other problems to get over every day, when they are landed with this noose around their necks. Why has this measure taken so long since it was announced in the budget so many months ago? Those people have been looking forward to this since. I hope there will not be much further delay and it can be progressed as soon as possible. The reduction in prescription charges is also very welcome. As Deputy Michael Harty has said, many people had to forego some medication because they could not afford the charges. When we talk about medical cards there are many issues that need to be resolved, but there is one issue in particular I have come across many times. It is where many people do not apply for a medical card until they get sick or until the day they go into hospital. Panic sets in because they know they do not have the funds to pay the hospital. They fill out their card application form and send it away. In due course, they get their card, but they may have already left the hospital two or three weeks prior to receiving the card. They are billed by the hospital and they must pay that bill, even though they subsequently receive the medical card. I am asking for this matter to be reviewed. If a person is entitled to the card then it should at least be in force from the day a person applies for it, or maybe even further back. People do not expect to get sick and they do not take the precaution of looking for the medical card even though they are entitled to it. As many people do not do this, I ask that the matter could be looked at to see if some fairness could apply to those people. I have been involved in a number of cases where people had to pay the hospital and there was no way in the world could they get out of it. They actually had to borrow money from the credit union to pay the bills. My next point is possibly unrelated to the topic we are speaking about. I am aware that the Kerry Cork health link bus, which takes people to Cork University Hospital, is on the road every day. The bus needs to be replaced. The operator needs to buy another bus but must pay VAT on the new bus. This is very unfair and I say to the Government it is collecting enough VAT from every other person in the State so please do not charge those people who provide a service that takes patients for cancer treatment to Cork, or to any other hospital. People should not have to pay for VAT on a vehicle such as this. I ask that this could be looked at to ensure the matter is addressed. It is very unfair. The Kerry Cork health link bus provides a great service for people who do not have a car or cannot drive a car themselves. I ask that the matter be looked into and addressed appropriately.	spk_470

I am always of the opinion that when most people get up in the morning they do so with good intentions to do well for themselves and everybody else. Likewise, I believe every Member elected to this Chamber tries to do their best to represent the people who elected them and, indeed, the people who did not vote for them. While this could be deemed a laudable proposal, I am worried about how it will pan out. How will the number of people to be treated in this unit be selected? Will it be an awful crowd and could it get bigger? Could we have more of these units around the country? Where will they be located? When somebody starts a business in a building in any part of Ireland, whatever planning permission there was for the use of the building beforehand they must apply for planning permission for change of use. That gives the people in the community and the area a chance to voice their concerns one way or the other. Will that be the case for these centres? Otherwise it would be very unfair to people with young children in a community close to the centre. They would be justified to be worried about people arriving to their area, be it on foot, by bicycle or by car, because they will end up wherever the facility will be. The people in the area are entitled to have an opportunity to decide whether they are in favour of it. As I said, the idea sounds good but it could develop into a very sad reality for many people later. Will it increase the number of users? How much will they be allowed to inject? Will people just come to these centres for the drug if they cannot get it elsewhere? I am worried about aspects of the legislation and for that reason I must oppose the proposal until I become more aware of what the outcome will be.	spk_504

However, I believe there are laws in the country good enough to protect the mother. I would be worthless in this world if I could not defend the right of a little baby to live. My first granddaughter will be two years old in a few months' time. From watching her since she was very small until now, I would have no use in this world if I could not do everything to give every other little baby that is conceived and coming into the world a fair chance at life. Life is precious from when the baby forms in the womb. That is my belief, and I will stand by my beliefs for as long as I live. It is very important that small babies be allowed to come into the world and that we do our best to protect them.

Why should a young person who goes through the rigorous driving test process and onto the road for the first time be penalised and quoted as much as €6,000 for insurance? I know a young man with third party insurance who crossed a road and ruined his new car. He had no redress, and cried on the road because he was going to work for the first time. He will be unable to insure his car or buy another. The cost of insurance is unbelievable. The costs for hauliers have tripled. What is happening? Is there any control in the country?

I thank Deputy Brophy for putting this Bill together to ensure the people who died so tragically at that time are at least commemorated once per year. It is very important to do that because if we do not know how we got here, we certainly do not know where we are going. As a contractor I have been into practically every farm in Kilgarvan and the neighbouring parishes and I have often stood in amazement looking at the ridges that people worked at with their bare hands. Those ridges are there because they were never dug out, with the potato crop failing at the time. It was a different set-up for me on a machine working and it is hard to understand how those people existed and what they went through to turn these little ridges, only to find the gardens did not grow. They had to leave them behind and, in many cases, starve because they did not have potatoes to feed themselves or their families. It must be remembered that there was plenty of grain and beet exported from this country to pay the landlords' rent in England. That was very unfortunate and unfair on the people who came before us as they had to watch all that going on while they could not get enough food for themselves in those very bad times to feed their families. I have a story from that time as I had a grandmother, who lived to be 97 and who died in 1993, who used to tell me that one of her grandmother's children died while being born at the time of the Famine. I have that little story from the Famine but it was so sad that so many people starved with the hunger and perished with disease. Many of them met a watery grave trying to get out of here and across to America in the coffin ships. When they could not stay alive they were thrown into the cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Many people are suffering in our country today because of hunger or they have no homes. It is very sad to see that happening again. I say to today's Government, why do we not do what the Germans did? They did not finish paying loans they owed for the First World War until three or four years ago. They are demanding the money they gave out at 0.5% in the early 2000s be returned to them at 6% or 7%. What is going on is totally unfair and unneeded. We should stand together to demand that these loan repayments be put out over a longer period. As fellows say to me when they owe me, I should be satisfied that they will pay when they have the money. Those people in Europe should be satisfied for us to say we will pay when we have it. We should not let our people suffer in hospitals or on waiting lists because they cannot get into hospital for operations. We should stand together and make them wait for their money. The Famine changed the face of Ireland forever. People existed between the rocks and the bogs, with small gardens to feed their families. They had to emigrate or die and there is no sign of them except in many instances the ridges that remain. They are little mounds of earth around the hills that were left behind when gardens did not grow and the potato crop failed. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak. We should not let the same happen to the people we are in charge of now and who look up to us. We should try to do better and make these fellows in Europe or the banks who demand the money wait for it.	spk_420

Local companies, which actually finish up doing the work for the bigger company that gets the job, cannot meet the exorbitant rates that are required to allow them to tender.

Ten companies in the country are running the contracts involving all the jobs now. The local traders are only left with the crumbs. They do not get the proper value out of the jobs that come into an area because often people from outside the area are awarded the contract but that does not benefit the local community. The local business man, be it a builder or a plan hire operator, gets very little benefit from it. The contract can be awarded to a person from far outside the area and if this issue is not addressed, it will continue to hurt rural communities. I ask the Minister of State to take cognisance of what is happening. It is the local man who finishes up doing the work involved in these contracts. As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, the local poor trader is asked to contribute to or to sponsor local events, be it a carnival or a field day, and were it not for those sponsors many of those events would not be held, given the cost of insurance and other costs, yet it is those events that keep communities going. We as Members of this House need to address this issue.

There is clearly great support for the motion. However, the talk must happen other than in this Chamber. It must involve politicians in Europe and Northern Ireland Ministers and politicians who are currently not being given the priority they deserve due to the forthcoming election in Northern Ireland. A specific Minister should be appointed to deal with Brexit, with no other responsibility in his or her portfolio, because it is a crucial time for the people of this country.

They do not believe the contradictory statements made in the House by many Government members. There does not seem to be any accountability. It is equally horrifying that the cost of another tribunal will be loaded on taxpayers, the low and middle income earners who leave for work early each morning in cars for which they have to pay dear insurance. They leave home in the mornings with snot in their noses and they will finish up paying for all the carry-on in this House and the carry-on that went on two or three years ago. They are saying there is no accountability. We learned last week that the Health Service Executive is not accountable to the Government and the Minister for Health cannot take any HSE manager to task for anything that happens in the organisation. My brother, Michael, and I, as well as many others, have been raising cases of people with cataracts who are going blind and cannot get a 90 minute procedure done. These procedures would cost much less than all of this. Who will pay for it all? We do not seem to be able to do anything about insurance costs either. We have only reports and investigations. We were told the issue would be sorted out and the Minister for Finance would come back to us on it. I am sure he tried to do so but the story now is that we cannot do anything about rising insurance costs, whether for a young fellow trying to pay car insurance to get to work or an old person trying to insure a car to be able to collect the pension. We do not seem to be able to sort out the issue of housing either. The Government has been working on this for 12 months and very little progress has been made.

I do not have time to speak about broadband, over-regulation and many other issues.

In fairness, the Government should take the concerns of the people into account in making a decision on this issue. It has been proven where there was only a 38 kV line that it affected five families who got sick and passed on. The places the debate is about are far away from me and I do not know what kind of ground is in issue. There is a case to be made for pylons where there is a mountain and it is not possible to put the cables underground. In those remote places, it might be all right to have overhead power lines. However, where the line is passing near houses or close to where people are travelling, it is not fair to do that. The companies involved are making enough profit to sustain undergrounding the cables where they are near people and where children are going to school who might be affected. We must safeguard people first and let the companies strive to make profit after. If they told the truth, in some cases it is cheaper to underground the cables where there is a certain kind of ground. If the ground is rocky, there is a case for building the pylons overground. If the ground is very boggy or swampy and it is hard for machinery to travel or to open trenches, it might not be practical either. In places like that, however, one will find there are no people. I ask the Minister to take into account the well-being and health of the people being asked to live close to these power lines because it is not fair. There is another way around it, which is to underground the cables. I ask that cables are not put overhead where there are people. It is not fair. I hope the Government will take cognisance of what previous speakers have said because it is a very genuine case. The health of the people must come first and everything else is after that.	spk_942

The Deputy is a young Minister and I understand he is trying to do his best but the fact is the system we have is not working. The HSE, as a body, is supposed to be helping our sick and vulnerable people who are in trouble, but it is not working out for many people. As I have stated here many times, as has my brother, Michael, it is not acceptable that people have to wait two years to have a cataract operation. The Sligo model is working in other parts of the country but why can it not be applied to Cork and Kerry? I dealt with one poor man could not bear to go blind and he had to sell his car to get the operation done privately. That is the truth. It is not good enough that young teenagers have to wait four to five years for orthodontic treatment. The hospital in Kenmare which is relatively new is only half open. It has only one respite bed for all of its catchment area. Wards are closed in Tralee general hospital. That is why we have waiting lists, queues and people on trolleys. I told the Minister about a recent case involving Cork University Hospital. As of today, there are people waiting three, four and five weeks to have open heart surgery in that hospital because there is not bed available for them after they have their operation. That is not acceptable. Deer Lodge in Killarney, which is a mental health facility, was built and opened in June 2015 but it is still not fully open. People are going private to get treatment. It is not good enough for people with medical problems who need attention to have to wait two or three years to meet a consultant. That is widespread and it must be sorted out. We have heard of ambulance reconfiguration, which means there will be fewer ambulances. A would-be patient in Rathmore on New Year's day had to wait 50 minutes for an ambulance to come from Kenmare when it should have come from Millstreet. Many facilities are being closed, including the Mary of the Angels facility. Also, the Lantern Lodge was closed because it was considered to be too costly to give the people attending it a meal That is what is happening. We have a shortage of nurses and those who are in our hospitals are overworked. We cannot pay our rural GPs to ensure they stay in rural areas. A total of €900 million has been allocated to the HSE this year and we are almost two months into the year and I do not see any improvement anywhere. Most working class people are paying 48% and 52% tax to pay for the cost of these services but the services are not being delivered. I have attended many HSE South/South West hospital group meetings but I have not got a straight answer to my questions from the officials. They have always been evasive when I have asked them a question.I am very sorry; my time is up. I have no faith in the current system. It must be broken up and something new put in place.	spk_23

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-01-26	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_3	I am again using my Leaders' Questions slot to emphasise the urgency of providing funding for the long-awaited Macroom bypass, which is of vital importance to all of Kerry and much of Cork in attracting investment and jobs to the counties and assisting all who travel to Cork and beyond daily to work and to receive medical care and attention in the primary care hospitals in Cork, especially cancer treatment. It is also anticipated that Fitzgerald Stadium will be one of the venues for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. This infrastructure will be of vital importance to strengthen Ireland's bid for the tournament and we must provide proper access to Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney, which will have capacity for at least 50,000 people. It is arguably one of the most picturesque pitches in the country. Many deputations from Kerry County Council have met representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Roads Authority about this project over many years and again recently but it is clear the project will not go ahead until the Government makes the funding available. When the review of the capital investment programme takes place in the next few months, I ask that the Macroom bypass be brought forward. The project is expected to cost approximately €230 million but more than a third of this will be recouped by the Government in repayments of VAT, taxes, licences and permits. It is anticipated the job will take at least three years to complete so if we work back from 2023, the latest the job can start if it is to be finished in time for the tournament is early 2019. A commitment to the project must be given by the Government to allow for the tendering process to proceed and the work to be carried out and finished in time. Killarney and Fitzgerald Stadium would make a wonderful venue as the town is renowned as one of the best tourist attractions in the country, with wonderful hotels, restaurants, bed and breakfasts and the massive INEC event centre, and there are many hotels in nearby towns. I appeal to the Minister to have his Government play its part in providing proper access to Kerry and Killarney in particular.We do not want these fine big broad men getting stuck going around the back turns in Chúl a' Bhucaigh or when parked in traffic jams in Macroom. All Deputies need to pull together to bring the World Cup to the country and to showcase our country to the rest of the world. I believe this mighty event will be the next great opportunity to showcase our country to the world. I am asking the Government to play its part in doing just that.	spk_77
Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-01-26	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_3	There appears to be a discrepancy. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has said it will cost €230 million. The Minister is saying it will cost €160 million. The lesser figures surely make it more attractive to get it going quicker. IBEC said yesterday that we have the lowest capital investment programme in Europe, even though interest rates and money were never cheaper. We must work at something like this; it is vital. This is a wonderful opportunity to get the project going and finished in time for the World Cup and indeed for all the people who have been looking for the bypass for over 35 years. It is 35 years since it was sought and approved by Kerry County Council. Surely, the people of Kerry are entitled to a proper road into our county. We are denied investment primarily because of this road, which is not of a proper standard.	spk_79

Danny HealyRae	64	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2017-01-24	dail	32	Order of Business	dbsect_3	The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, was in Kerry yesterday, outlining the housing strategy to deal with the housing crisis. However, more needs to be done before many of these actions or policies will work. Yesterday, the Minister said if elderly people moved in with a son or a daughter, they could then rent their house to the local authority and it could become available for social housing. This announcement has been queried by many elderly people since. Having inquired into this, I note the pension entitlements for a person on a non-contributory pension taking up this offer would be affected. What the Minister spoke about will not become a reality if he does not provide an incentive. Why would a person on a non-contributory pension give up their house for this leasing scheme if no incentive is provided? No elderly people will harm their pension if some incentive is not provided.	spk_50

We have it the other way around now - the banks are robbing the people. There is frustration and anger at the fact that so many people lost their homes. The repercussions for families, children and parents have been significant. People have had to leave their homes. I know so many who have lost their homes. It is so sad to think that banks and financial institutions could do what they have done. It is not a building that did this; it was the people within those institutions who inflicted this wrong on those affected. There should be some accountability from the managers or the people in charge who meted out this bad wrong to these unsuspecting people. I was comforted to hear the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, saying that there will be redress and a compensation package for the disenfranchised borrowers. I hope it does not take long because these people have suffered for long enough. The people who did this should be made accountable for their actions and behaviours. The examination by the Central Bank needs to be fast-tracked and we need to see a determined effort to finalise it as soon as possible. I recall the anguish many felt some years ago when the banks squealed on the people with foreign accounts. The banks advised these people to take out these foreign based accounts. It was not the case that people in lonely hillside farms thought of putting money into these foreign addressed accounts; the banks advised them to do it. Then, the banks gave their names to the Revenue Commissioners and squealed on them. Many people suffered at the time because of the advice the banks gave to unsuspecting account holders. The people in these banks who meted out this wrong to so many families should be made to feel pain now because it is only right and fair.

I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that Kerry County Council wrote to the Department in 2015 stating that 80% of applicants would not qualify.

Approximately 80% of applicants for the scheme do not qualify. What is the Government going to do about this very serious matter? I ask the Taoiseach to investigate the matter.

Some, although not all, grain farmers were hit so badly that they got no crop and therefore no income. I ask the Minister to accept the motion. All they are asking for is €4.5 million. The Minister could get it from Europe if he applies to it. There is a special fund that can be accessed when farmers are hit by inclement weather. Perhaps the Minister does not know about it, but it has been used in the past. Grain farmers were struggling anyway, but the tillage men in Brandonwell, Fenit, Ardfert, Ballyheigue, Causeway, Abbeydorney and throughout north Kerry were badly hit because they got no grain at all. They were swamped for the months of August and September. Likewise the people from Ballygarvan, Bandon, Dunmanway, Clonakilty and as far as the Mizen Head were hit with sea fog and they got no crop at all. These people who are in the Gallery are on their uppers now and have not a bob. They will not be able to continue into next year. Talking about a loan at this stage is only codding them. That might suit later on, but it will not help them now. Now is the Minister's time. If he rejects this motion, he will pay a high price because many people very close to him are suffering badly. This needs to be targeted at those who are in trouble because some farmers got grain, but the ones who did not, especially those in Cork, Kerry and up along the west, are the ones who need to be looked after. If the Minister ignores the motion or goes against it, he will pay a high price for it. Fair is fair; these people have nothing left and have nothing to start from for next year. The Government amendment is only a cod. As for the Deputy who said she would like to blame me for the weather, she will not get away with that. That will be for another day to sort out; it is about the farmers this evening.	spk_395

Many people in north-west Cork and parts of east Kerry are very worried because the post office in Ballydesmond is due to close at the end of February. They are hopeful An Post will issue a tender for the service again and that someone in the locality will be successful in getting the contract and will keep a post office open in the village. The Ballydesmond post office is very important for the vast rural area of east Kerry and north-west Cork. Many people working in that area use the post office regularly. Munster Joinery employs almost 1,400 people and Kelly's of Ballydesmond, a big civil engineering company is also a significant employer. Indeed, there are four or five big employers in that area and a post office is needed. The post office in Ballydesmond, as with many parishes, is one of the last facilities available that make the place a village. Most of the other facilities and services associated with villages have gone, such as the creameries, small shops and pubs. If Ballydesmond were to lose its post office, that could signal the end of the village and the identity of the community would be lost. Down the road, only a few miles away, the post office at Knocknagree is due to close in March. We are not so sure if someone will tender for the contract because there is no other shop in the village. There was a little shop in the post office but that is due to close. It is very sad for the community in Knocknagree, where Sliabh Luachra music and the best of Irish traditional music is played regularly. Knocknagree plays host to many big music events and it would be very sad to see the parish without a post office. Not enough is being done to ensure post offices remain open. We have had Bills, promises and so forth, but all that is needed is for more work to be given to the post offices. Sadly, the last Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, instructed her officials to tell social welfare recipients to provide the Department with their bank details in order that their payments could be transferred electronically via the banks. That did an awful lot of harm to rural post offices. People did what they were told and the post offices were left behind. As the previous speaker said, more work should be given to the post offices. The driver's licence service and many other services and schemes could be administered through the post offices. An increase in the price of stamps is not the way forward. If I was to increase my rates by 30%, I would not last more than a couple of days in business. I will not be supporting the increase in the price of stamps. I am sorry that I cannot support it but some other way will have to be found to deal with the financial issues. Such an increase will signal the end for An Post completely.	spk_448

Farmers were awarded the shares per thousand gallons of milk quota but it was not payment for the milk. The shares were awarded as part of a goodwill gesture. However, if a farmer falls out with the co-op, he or she will be made to take €1.25 per share and the shares will be taken from him or her. If the farmer had paid tax on the shares when he or she received them, will Revenue then give the farmer the tax that was taken off him or her previously when he or she first got the shares? I expect farmers would have an awful job trying to get it back. If we have a role to play as elected representatives and the Minister has a role to play, then surely fair play must be meted out. If Revenue wins the test case we must ensure that the farmers or those who own the shares will not have to pay retrospectively because, in the words of the Revenue official, this was a new departure for it.

Eviction is very hurtful and painful for the family affected by it. It is also very traumatic for the close neighbours, the community and children who are friends of the children who must leave the house in which they may have been born. When a family must leave their house because they cannot pay the mortgage, could the council or voluntary bodies intervene and purchase the house if it was reasonably priced? I am sure it would not work well in Dublin where houses cost so much but down our way in much of rural Ireland, many houses can be purchased for €100,00, €150,000 or €200,000. It is very sad to see families having to leave their homes because of small sums of money. Could the council or voluntary bodies purchase the house and rent it back to the family for a number of years - at least until the family gets on its feet? It may be the case that when the family finds its feet and family members get jobs and get going again, the family would be in a position to buy back the house from the local authority or voluntary housing association. I ask the Minister to probe that idea. It is not in the Bill, but it is still part of the trouble we are in and people being evicted and finding themselves homeless. Given that the Government has a big stake in at least two major banks, I am asking the Minister to take a good look at that and see if he could make use of that proposal.	spk_395

However, many of the rivers and waterways for which the OPW claims it is not responsible are not being addressed. There should be one body responsible for ensuring that water can flow as freely as possible in all of the rivers. Every river in the country is blocked by both trees and silt. No farmer or land owner has been able to touch any river for the last 20 years because of cross compliance and the possibility of losing the single farm payment. The Flesk river runs through the Flesk valley and 22 houses and a community hall are constantly being flooded. The N22, the national primary route into Kerry has been flooded several times. The national CFRAM programme carried out studies for five years but has now withdrawn from the Flesk river and will do nothing to help. Kerry County Council says it is not its responsibility. The National Roads Authority is carrying out a study but I cannot see that going anywhere. The college and the community hall in Castleisland have flooded several times. There are similar problems in Kenmare, while the Lake Hotel in Killarney has flooded three times because the Laune river coming out of the lake is blocked up and needs to be cleaned. Perhaps a grant could be given to farmers to assist them in clearing rivers on their own land. That is an option that could be explored. At the moment, farmers are afraid to go near the rivers in case they lose their single farm payment. In England the authorities have ordered that every river in the country be cleaned as well as any other waterway that is causing trouble. Why can we not do the same here? Inland Fisheries Ireland has held people back. Indeed, it has called gardái and threatened farmers, telling them to get out of the rivers. That is not fair, particularly as rivers that are overshadowed by trees are no use for fishing.  We must have one body in charge. I support the motion and ask that one body be put in place to oversee all of this. Otherwise, many places will be left behind. Every river in Kerry is blocked, including the Gweestin and the rivers coming out of places like Castleisland and Killarney. We are at a standstill. We need money in Kerry.

Nothing has been discussed more than this topic since I was elected to this House. It was mentioned in the programmes for Government day after day and even before I came up here, it was discussed in Kerry County Council. So much has been said but words are not enough because words will not build houses. These Bills will not build the houses either but certain things need to be done. I disagree with Deputy Mattie McGrath when he stated that the local authorities had lost their way in house building. The Taoiseach also said that and I got very cross with him that day because that is not true. How could the local authorities build houses when they did not have any funds to build them? There was mention of 30 houses being built in Tipperary last year. In terms of social housing, three rural cottages were built in County Kerry in the past seven years. That is a fact. It is the Gospel truth and nothing but the truth and it is a shame and a disgrace given the number of people on the housing list. We were promised €62.5 million at the start of 2015 to address the housing crisis in Kerry but, as of yet, not one social house has been built. There are only a few days left in 2016 and I know that no houses will be built before the end of the year. However, 22 houses are to be built in Killarney. They went out for tender during the summer but they have been put out for tender again. As a result of the restrictions the Department has imposed, no official in Kerry County Council would sign off on the tenders that came in and this now has to be put out for tender again. It only went out the other day. I worry about whether these houses will be built in 2017. I hope they are but I am not so sure. Private builders are not building houses. The only houses that are currently being built in County Kerry are one-off houses that are being built by farmers' sons, etc. A few houses are being built by local people who have enough money to build a house but others cannot get money from the banks.The developers and builders will tell us this. As Deputy Mattie McGrath stated, rogue builders were blamed for the crash but many good builders also went down in the crash. I am sorry for them because they provided valuable housing units and a good service. They cannot dream of starting business again because they will not get finance from the banks. While other lending institutions from outside the country will lend to them, they will do so at interest rates of 10% and 12%. The average cost of a house in County Kerry is not €400,000, €500,000 or €600,000 but between €210,000 and €220,000. If builders paid an interest rate of 10%, their profit from building a house would be €4,000 or €5,000. Who would take on such a responsibility, especially given all the regulations builders must adhere to and the requirement to have the key turned in the door before they would be paid? Staged payments, which was how builders used to be paid, have been ruled out, which is also wrong. An authority should be responsible for checking that a project is progressing and the works are being done to a satisfactory standard. If problems are identified at the final stage, the final payment could be delayed. Small builders and developers cannot start building because of the regulations in place. The regulatory side is not working.  I will refer to a case I highlighted previously involving a young farmer who wanted to borrow €100,000 from a bank to build a house. He, his brothers and other relatives were in a position to do much of the work themselves. Lo and behold, the bank insisted that he borrow €180,000 even though his income ruled him out of accessing a loan of that size. He is now at a standstill.  Other problems have occurred on a long stretch of the N72 approaching Killarney. Four families who had enough money to build new houses received planning permission from Kerry County Council and the council's road engineers passed their plans for road access. Everything was fine but, lo and behold, in 2012, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, insisted that access to national secondary roads would no longer be approved. County Kerry has more miles of national secondary road that any other county. I have asked that this impediment be removed and I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Canney, to address the issue because the road in question is as straight as the barrel of a gun for 400 yd. in either direction. There is no way the four families in question will be granted planning permission. They will not be allowed to build in their own place but are supposed to move into Killarney, which is overcrowded and has no housing available. Deputies are being contacted by many people who are having their homes taken from them. Why can the banks not do a deal with the local authorities to allow these people to lease their homes and become council tenants? They could then purchase their homes when they get up and running. Surely it would be easy to introduce such a mechanism given that the State has a large stakeholding in the banks. The Minister referred to the introduction of temporary, fast-track planning arrangements. Why are the arrangements temporary? Why does the Minister not propose to keep them in place once they are up and running? At the current rate, we will not build enough houses in the next 20 years. Why is the word ""temporary"" used to describe these arrangements? The Minister also stated that applications would be submitted to An Bord Pleanála. As all Deputies know, An Bord Pleanála does not make decisions on planning applications for at least six months. The organisation should be directed to respond within a quicker timeframe than six months. Reference was made to the introduction of new screening arrangements for the conduct of environmental impact assessments to streamline the process of determining planning for the consent for and subsequent undertaking of works, including emergency flood relief works, to be carried out by the Office of Public Works. This is fine in cases where the OPW is responsible for the rivers. In County Kerry, however, the OPW refuses to assume responsibility for even a fraction of the rivers or waterways. In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Canney, I am grateful to him for what he has tried to do for the county. One authority must deal with flooding problems. Inland Fisheries Ireland has a say in this matter, which means people are threatened with the Garda, jail or the loss of farm payments if they go near a river. Our rivers are clogged up and blocked for this reason. When rivers cannot flow, they flood houses and roads. We have heard a ridiculous proposal from the OPW to create flood plains and build walls to hold back waters. This is not the answer, which has always been to clean out the rivers and allow the waters to flow. Time is slipping by and we will soon be into a new year. Next year will go just as quickly or maybe even quicker than this year. If something is not done to have one authority deal with rivers and flooding, we will be back to square one.  The Minister is a hard-working man who does his level best. I give him that but he will have to get stuck into the Department that is responsible for the restrictions that are preventing local authorities from building houses because, as hard as he tries, his reputation is on the line.

We have had flooding in County Kerry.  I will support the Bill. As well as the people who have been helped by the OPW, there are others who have been flooded and sorted themselves out. They should be looked after too in the Bill. Culverts in housing estates were blocked and the matter was dealt with by the local authority and the people living in them. They should be included in the Bill. They need insurance just like anyone else. I was in Glenflesk, Lackabane and other places around Killarney which were flooded, when the water was flowing in the front door and out the back door. I know how the people concerned felt and how vulnerable they were. A person's home is his or her castle. It is very sad when people's homes are flooded. The Bill asks the insurance companies to insure people where the problem has been sorted out. All other categories who have sorted themselves out and can prove why they were flooded should be included. There are many reasons flooding occurs such as the blocking of rivers. Many are still blocked. The Government should have one body or group to look after rivers. The River Shannon has not been cleared since it was cleared by the English in the 1880s.	spk_400

An elderly person of 72 or 73 who never had an accident must now pay €710. This has risen from €350, despite the fact that the man is driving the same car. It has passed its test, everything is perfect and the man has made no claim. This is the way it is going. Youngsters starting out in the world should get a chance unless they do something wrong but they are being penalised from the start. Young fellows who want to drive to work are getting quotations of €5,000 and €6,000. With regard to transport, the quotations for lorry drivers have increased from €2,000 to €5,000. One transport company that was paying €75,000 is being quoted €250,000 for next year. This company will not be able to stay in business. Buses, especially school buses, have been affected. Quotations have risen from €2,000 to €4,000; they have doubled. Many school bus contractors are tied into contracts for the next three or four years, and some for up to five years. They will not be able to stay in business. An elderly woman who contacted me paid €330 last year but was quoted €810 for the coming year. One of her sons rang the insurance company. He, having a lot of vehicles, asked what was going on with his mother and he managed to reduce the premium back to €330. Things like this need to be explained. The cost of public liability insurance for businesses has gone mad. Companies are now trying to decide whether to keep going and they are analysing how much it would cost to get out of business. Homes threatened by flooding can get no insurance. The authorities will not clear the rivers. It is well known the houses are not sinking, but the rivers are rising. An insurance broker has told me there has been a huge increase in the number and value of claims. Claimants cannot lose because some solicitors work on a no-foal, no-fee basis. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board is dealing with only 20% of claims now. Minor claims for whiplash amount to £7,600 in England whereas the figure in Ireland is €19,400. Up to €77,000 is claimed for serious whiplash in this country. Some solicitors are blatantly advertising for claimants, and insurance claims are not being fought because 70% of cases are being won. England, France and other countries are paying a lot less in the case of such claims.	spk_95

I cannot see how this is such a priority or why parties are tripping over each other to be out front with this proposal and ensure that a lord mayor is elected in Dublin. Surely there is enough bureaucracy and layers of local government, as well as Deputies, Ministers and everything else. I do not blame Dublin Deputies for trying to look after their patch, but there are Deputies in the parties putting forward the proposal from around the country. There is no mention of bringing back the town councils that were dismantled by Phil Hogan. It is not a priority. I will talk about priorities.  The Killarney municipal area had six crews looking after the roads, but that number has been reduced to two and no more staff can be employed. That situation is replicated right around every municipal area in Kerry and every other council. I ask that staff be replaced. We need to ensure that rather than having too many chiefs and not enough Indians that we have enough Indians to look after the needs of the people who are paying rates, motor tax and every other kind of tax. They see no value in the taxes they are currently paying. This proposal is premature until everything else is considered in light of the abolition of town councils. A mayor in Killarney was vital and is still necessary. Many visitors from abroad want to meet the mayor, but can now only meet a cathaoirleach - they do not know what kind of giolla deacair he is. They think he is someone from the mountains who has nothing to do with local government. I am sorry, but I will fight for that as long as I am in office because one of the things I promised I would do is try to ensure that we reinstate town councils. They cost very little and urban councillors did a lot of work. They deserved better treatment than what they got and I ask that until that issue is considered to the fullest it should not be a priority to elect a lord mayor in Dublin. It would be much more beneficial to those who are trying to travel in and out of Dublin if Dublin Deputies built more lanes on the motorways so that people are not clogged behind each other day in and day out and cannot get into Dublin. Money should be spent on that because the proposal for an elected mayor will cost a lot of money if the Bill is passed. I ask other Members who are elected by people around the country not to vote in favour of the Bill at this time.	spk_295

The proposal, however, in this instance will break up a community setting. Sadly, there is no funding for this policy because it cost €600,000 a year to cater for one person. This person was not in a seriously bad way. Another person cost up to €2 million. It is wrong to put him out in the community. There is not even money for this policy even though hundreds of thousands of euro are spent by managers, advisers and policymakers trying to put this policy together to break up a place like St. Mary's of the Angels. This is shocking. Will the Minister for Health and the Ministers of State go to see the people I am talking about before breaking the place up and disbanding it? The land and the place were given free and it was built up by voluntary fund-raising. It is shocking to think it is about to be taken down. No patients are being taken in there now. This decongregation policy has to be reconsidered because one size does not fit all. It may suit the odd person but it certainly does not suit most of the people in St. Mary's of the Angels.

It is very unfortunate. It is very unfair when one thinks of all the tax they have paid and the people they have, in many instances, employed. If some source with which they were trading goes out of business, they may find themselves in a very vulnerable situation. Sole traders and people who work for themselves take very little out of their companies. They try to improve their companies by building them up and putting more into them, but all of a sudden a market or source of work may deplete with the result that they are left in a very vulnerable position. A couple contacted me recently where the husband's very good line of plumbing work simply ran out for a while. The wife rang me because they were hungry and had no money for food. It appeared they were going to have to sell some of his equipment but if that happened, he would be unemployed forever. He could never put that kit together again. They were tided over for a short while, which is all people want. They want some facility or to qualify for social welfare while things are bad until they get back on their feet again. It is the same where people are sick, which happens as well. It has been stated that social welfare schemes are to be extended to the self-employed, particularly the extension of eligibility for the invalidity pension. This is long overdue and we campaigned for it for many years. The self-employed do not want to be out sick but over the years many have come to my clinics who were in bad shape and in tears. They were very hurt that they could no longer work due to illness, but they had little or no support. I have seen no mention of extending eligibility for illness benefits to the self-employed and I am curious to know how it will work in reality if they have to have been unable to work for one year to qualify for invalidity pension. What supports will be available to them in the short term and during the one-year qualifying period? I would like to hear more on this. Clarification is required because these people have paid their share and are as entitled as everyone on PAYE to get some assistance when they find themselves in vulnerable situations. Another issue with social welfare is that in some instances, a few days' work becomes available but it may be difficult to get people to do it. There are people in receipt of social welfare who would like to work for a few days, weeks or months but are afraid to do so because they know it is only short-term and it will be difficult to re-enter the social welfare system. They have families and dependants and cannot take the risk of going to work. Many people think those in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or other social welfare payments do not want to work but that is not true. If they were able to work for a short time they would do so but they are afraid they will not be able to re-enter the social welfare system and that their dependants or children would be hungry. Something needs to be done to address this matter. I mentioned home help and the fair deal scheme to the Taoiseach a number of weeks ago. Elderly people may need home help in the mornings or evenings to get them in and out of bed but service providers are not inclined to provide such hours. Instead, they suggest such people need to be in nursing homes for long-stay care and should not be in receipt of home help at all. There is no problem in providing the fair deal scheme for such people but what I ask is for the Minister for Social Protection to provide the fair deal scheme for people living at home. If the money is in place, it will help the same people, namely, those who want to stay at home but cannot get home help. There should be some discretion as to how the money is spent rather than insisting it can only be given to elderly people who go into nursing homes. The fair deal scheme is not a fair deal for farming families. In fact, it is a very lousy scheme. If a member of a farming family has to go into a nursing home, the farm and dwelling are both taken into account in the valuation process. Over three years, at a rate of 7.5% per year, that is a total of 22.5% of the total value of a farm. We all know the current situation regarding farming. Beef farmers were never worse off. In the past few weeks, milk farmers have improved their lot a little but some grain and tillage farmers will not be working at all next year because they have taken such a hit. I ask that the dwelling on a farm be the only asset that is assessed to bring farmers in line with every other person who only owns a residence. The fair deal scheme hurts other sectors of people such as those who live over pubs. The pub provides their income and when the owner of the property has to go into a nursing home, the entire property is taken into account for valuation purposes. The same applies to those who own shops. Many people in rural Ireland live over the shops they own. They are becoming scarce, but they still exist. Publicans and shopkeepers have raised this issue with me recently. They are being very badly hit, to such an extent that they are afraid that if a person who needs attention goes into a nursing home, they will lose their pubs or shops and, as a result, their livelihoods for ever. They are in a serious predicament. The scheme needs to be reviewed to ensure fair play. Every day, we hear about people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance who have been told they must visit their nearest office and Turas Nua is the organisation dictating the terms. I know of a young man who is 23 years of age who has attended an office one day per week to sign on for the past seven or eight weeks. He is being treated the same way as a person who stabbed someone, is on remand, has been granted bail and has to visit a Garda station two or three times a week to sign on or be seen. The person to whom I referred has been told he will have to appear in the office for 52 weeks.	spk_272
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-11-09	dail	32	Social Welfare Bill 2016: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_33	It is a scandal. The man does not have a car and has to travel 19 miles to be seen every week. He must thumb for a lift on a national primary route as he cannot cycle that distance to the office. He is hoping someone can drive him in and out of the town in question. He is in receipt of €100 per week. It appears to me that Turas Nua wants to keep him going to the office so that he will get fed up, lie down at home and forget about the €100 payment. The system is very unfair and is leaving a sour taste in the mouth of a young person who is trying to survive until he gets a job. That carry-on should not be entertained. I must again refer to school buses, which are very important in rural Ireland. When local schools in rural areas were closed years ago, people were promised they would always have transport to central schools. That is not the case. The Department of Education and Skills has reneged on that promise. It is imposing clauses, such as the requirement that ten children must travel on a bus for a route to operate. That is not possible in rural Ireland today. If ten children do not avail of the service, the service is not provided. Fair play is required as people in rural Ireland are as entitled to go to school as those in built-up areas. They have been denied this right because assurances and promises were given in the past that they would always have transport to central schools. That is not happening and I want the Minister to address the matter. There is a lot of discussion about housing and the lack thereof. If the Government is serious about building social housing it will have to do something about the regulations that are being set for local authorities by the Department. It is now the case that no one will sign off on anything because they are scared they will lose their jobs. In County Kerry, three rural cottages were built in the past eight years. We hope to build 22 in Killarney this year. This issue has been ongoing since 2014 but rules and regulations are set by the Department and unless the Government gets stuck in and sorts out the problem, no houses will be built in Kerry, Dublin or anywhere else.The rules that have been set by the Department cannot be complied with by local authorities. The Government needs to get down to brass tacks and sort this out. These are big problems but the Government is not attending to them.	spk_274

There were changes in the climate way back in times when there was no industrialisation and when there were far fewer animals on farms in our country. There was no intensification of farming in the centuries gone by, yet we had intense heat and long periods of very cold, wet weather, which culminated in the loss of many lives in the famine in the 1740s. This was caused by two years of incessant rain and extremely cold winters. El Niño and the Gulf Stream have played a significant part in changing the climate over the centuries. Many untruths have been bandied about for many years. They told us about the ozone layer, greenhouse gases and cans of hairspray or whatever but they never told us that it was nuclear testing-----	spk_21
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-10-27	dail	32	UN Paris Agreement on Climate Change: Motion	dbsect_2	The Minister and I are the same in that we have nothing on our heads to spray. Anyway, we are managing. They never told us that nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean 50 years ago actually caused the serious damage to the ozone layer. I am thankful it is now mending and curing. It has nothing to do with policies in any country in recent times. I am very worried about this agreement because it will have a severe negative impact on farmers. Farmers must be protected because of the consequences if the farming industry goes down. Farming is facing a serious crisis currently. If it is impacted negatively any further, it will hurt the whole country. When farming is doing badly, the whole country will not be doing well. It is rumoured that the national herd may have to be reduced. I will not support any policy that will impinge negatively on our agricultural production. It is said that if Ireland misses its 2020 targets, the likelihood is that this country will be fined. Three years is too short a period to achieve whatever targets the Minister is talking about. The honest truth is that they will not be achieved in that time. As I said to the Minister, farmers are at the crossroads. Many young farmers are declining to take over the family farm. They are refusing to take it from the parents and are going different directions because they see that they will be doing very well if they have one good year out of every five. Only two or three years ago, farmers were told to increase milk production. What is the story now? There is no fair price for milk, and many of the farmers who went into production for the first time or increased their production have serious financial problems at present. The Government is doing very little to help them. The last Government told them that the Chinese would drink milk but, as I understand it, they are not interested in drinking milk at all. Forestry was referred to. It was said it will help to reduce carbon emissions. However, the grant for planting on marginal land, which is not agriculturally productive in many ways but would create an income for farmers, has been set up in such a way that one must have 80% green ground and 20% marginal ground. On any farm or landholding in south Kerry and many other parts of Kerry it is the other way around: 20% green ground and 80% marginal ground. I ask the Minister to reintroduce the grant for planting forestry. If the Government is saying this will help to reduce emissions, it needs to get its show together and give farmers a proper grant for planting marginal ground because at present it is not there and no planting is taking place. The Government blames climate change for flooding. The fact is that every river is blocked. The Shannon has not been cleared out since the English cleared it out in the 1800s. Why is that? In the past 20 years, we have seen the introduction of cross-compliance, whereby if the farmer breaks any rule or cleans out a river, the Inland Fisheries has farmers and landowners insistent that they will not go near the river. This has meant that all the rivers have been clogged because farmers cannot afford to lose their payments. That is their bread and butter. That is what they feed their families from, and if they were to lose their payments, that would be the end of them. They could not feed their families, send their children to school or keep going at all, so cross-compliance has ensured that nobody has gone near a river. Take the Flesk river in Kerry which goes down through the parish of Glenflesk. A total of 22 houses and the community hall in the area were recently flooded, and the church was almost flooded. The national primary road we need to get emergency services in and out of our county flooded. The road and the houses did not sink, but the level of water has increased because the water cannot flow freely through our Flesk river and into the lakes of Killarney. That is what is happening. The Government should address these issues and call the Inland Fisheries aside to get it to listen to reason because what it is at is not reasonable. It is depriving the rivers of fish because the bushes are closing in over the rivers and the fish need sunlight to reproduce and exist in our rivers. Inland Fisheries is hurting what it is supposed to favour. Regarding diesel and electric vehicles, why talk about electric cars when we have nowhere to plug them in to charge them up? It is only pure waffle to say that people should diversify and buy electric cars when there are no facilities to plug them in. They can only travel 100 km at a time. If the Minister were travelling around Sneem tonight in an electric car and going as far as Caherdaniel and wanted to come back to Sneem, he would not get there. It is ridiculous. What is the Government talking about? The farming community is the easiest target. I can see that farmers will be hit so I do not support this agreement. A few years ago, the Government incentivised people to go down the road of getting diesel cars, which was grand, and many people have done that. However, diesel is now almost as dear as petrol. There was talk that the Government would raise excise duty and VAT on diesel. Gladly, it did not, but sadly, the cost of diesel has increased anyway. It is now nearly on a par with petrol. I ask the Minister and the entire Government how it is that when barrels of oil have never been cheaper, oil is getting as dear as it was when a barrel of oil was at its most expensive. We could do a lot to have cheaper energy. I refer to wind energy and solar panels. There is no policy on solar panels in this country, as far as I can see. People ask me about solar energy. There is no such thing as applying for planning permission for them, yet people are hurt when they hear that solar panels are to be put near them. There needs to be defined policy on solar panels. I fully support wind energy projects. I do ask that they not be put near homes, particularly family homes. They need to be kept a distance away. Some say 700 or 800 m is a fair distance. We need to support the wind energy industry more because it is impossible to get planning permission for a wind turbine project at present. Hydro-energy is an impossibility. Inland Fisheries will not let us clean out the rivers so that people do not get flooded. The Minister knows that installing hydro projects in rivers will not work unless the Government talks to Inland Fisheries and gets its act together in that regard.	spk_23

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-10-26	dail	32	Finance Bill 2016: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_29	The Government's credibility will depend on the success of the housing strategy it announced some weeks ago and again in the budget a fortnight ago. Many young couples are disappointed that the Finance Bill does not provide any help to first-time buyers who purchase a second-hand home. It is also unclear whether repossessed houses in housing developments that fell into other people's hands will qualify as new houses. The help-to-buy scheme is unfair to persons whose first home was repossessed as these people never owned their homes because they were taken from them on the basis that they could not pay for them. It is sad that no facility has been provided to this group when they seek to buy a home. It is unfortunate and unfair that they will not be classed as a first-time buyer. I am glad houses in County Kerry are not as expensive as in other places. I am aware of a farmer's son who wanted to borrow €100,000 from a bank to build a house. The bank would only lend him €180,000, the amount it stated it would cost to complete the house. It would then be more suitable for the bank to get rid of the house if the young man found himself in the position that he could not pay for it. He only wanted to borrow €100,000 because he has brothers who work in the building trade and he could get other help to do much of the work involved. The bank will not give him less than €180,000, which would be grand except his income means he does not qualify for a mortgage of €180,000.  In other parts of the country, the help-to-buy scheme will assist first-time buyers paying up to €600,000 for a house. If a buyer needs to borrow 70% of the cost of €600,000 home, he or she will have to take out a mortgage of €420,000. To obtain such a facility from a bank, the borrower's gross annual income would have to be €120,000. People on incomes of €33,000 or at most €40,000 believe this is wrong because the scheme will help upper-income earners to the detriment of lower-income earners. The scheme seems to be designed for the wealthy rather than the poor. I and many others are very hurt by this because it is not fair that it facilitates people earning €120,000. Others have been left out, for example, people seeking to purchase a second-hand home to do up with funding from the home renovation scheme in order that they can put a roof over their heads. The help-to-buy scheme is unworkable when one considers the figures. A person seeking a mortgage of €420,000 must have an 84% deposit. The Government's attempt to rectify the housing problem is poor and will not succeed. We also have many other problems in the housing sector. It is clear, for example, that only four or five construction companies will qualify under procurement rules to tender for national or State building schemes. This is unfortunate because smaller builders who have stood the test of time will not get a look in or a smell of these tenders. They will do the building for the bigger companies and many of them will not get paid, as happened many times in the past. This is very unfortunate. Many issues need to be rectified but the budget made no attempt to do so. The biggest problem facing the country is housing and we are not properly addressing the social housing aspect of the problem. 	spk_313
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-10-18	dail	32	Order of Business	dbsect_3	I wish to ask the Minister for Health why the HSE is advising elderly people to access the fair deal scheme and enter nursing homes instead of giving them funding for a few more hours of home help.It appears there is no funding for home-help services and the advice being given is that people should access nursing homes. I am asking the Minister and the Taoiseach to allow the HSE discretion in dealing with elderly people, the fair deal scheme and home-help services. There should be discretion in having the funding for the fair deal scheme used for extra home-help hours rather than insisting that elderly people go into nursing homes. Flexibility should be given to the HSE to use the money as it sees fit for home help as well as the fair deal scheme.	spk_208
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-10-18	dail	32	Funding for Education: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_36	Reports suggest that 600 rural national schools are under threat as numbers drop below 50 students. If a large number of these school close, it will be to the detriment of rural Ireland. Something must be done and the Minister and the Department must understand that when it is suggested that a two-teacher school needs 19 pupils, different factors need to be assessed.About the only thing I agree with the Taoiseach on is that things will turn around in rural Ireland. We hope they will but if the schools are closed it will not help. I know of families that have come back to the area. One family has brought five children to the local school. That is a big difference. It should ensure the school will stay open for a lot longer than was thought. There must be 19 pupils for a two-teacher school. The Minister of State should look at what will happen going forward. Is there a possibility that more children could come back and we will have more in the next couple of years? The Minister of State should take into account that when that small school is shut, the town school will need extensions built on. There will be no bother then getting more teachers and it will cost a lot of money. That also has to be taken into account. There are longer distances for the children to go to the central school. Many families are down to one car now and will not get school transport. The commitment given to students of schools that closed down before, that they would be taken to a central school, has been reneged on.	spk_449
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-10-12	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The housing crisis rolls on and its cause is the lack of supply. Would-be developers and building contractors cannot start building in the private sector as they cannot borrow from many of our mainstream banks. The banks will not lend them any money. Would-be builders do not have any money of their own and the only option is to borrow from lending institutions outside the State that are imposing interest rates with double-digit figures. Can the Government intervene and ascertain why banks in this country will not lend to developers or building contractors? That is where we have to start. The second blockage is the amount of levies and State taxes being demanded from developers and building contractors. Grant Thornton carried out an independent review and found that the levies, taxes and VAT amount to 37% of the cost of building a house. Can the Taoiseach do something to reduce these charges? Local government levies for road, water and sewage infrastructure are very excessive. Can the Taoiseach intervene here? Builders cannot start without a water connection. It is fine paying the full cost of the water connection but the trouble is the levy. It costs builders a lot of money, which must be paid up-front. They cannot pay it up-front. This has to be addressed if we are to resolve the housing crisis. VAT, taxes and PAYE for workers have to be paid in every two months even though the builder will not be paid for the house or any part of it until it is completed and the key is turned in the door. The Minister responsible must deal with these issues. Previously, the builder or developer was paid in stages when a house was bought from the plans. On the first stage, the builder was paid for the site. A second instalment was paid when the building was at ground-floor level, and a third was paid when the roof was on. The last payment was demanded only when the house was finished. New rules mean the builder now cannot be paid until the house is totally finished. This regulation was put in place to deal with rogue builders but most builders, or 95%, were always fine. The 5% could be dealt with by having quality or standard checks organised by an independent body, established by the Government, or the building control officials in the local authorities. Payment should be allowed at different stages. Builders will not even dream of starting under the present arrangement. They must take all the risk and deal with all the safety regulations and the burden of waiting for money, finishing up with a profit margin of 2% to 3% because of the cost of their loans, if they get them.	spk_46
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-10-12	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Nothing has moved on and nothing is moving, and that is the truth of it. I am not happy with the Taoiseach's answer because he moved away from the two questions I asked him to deal with. If he keeps doing that, we will finish up where we are with no house being built. The fact of the matter is that developers cannot access money in this country at present and they do not have money of their own because they have been out of business for the past eight or nine years. That is one problem. The other problem is that the levies, taxes and VAT, which amount to 37% of the cost of the building of the house, must be paid upfront. I ask the Government to intervene here and do something about this. It can have all the pies in the skies and all the notions and all the strategies but they will amount to nothing if it does not deal with the fundamental problem, which is money for the builders to get them going. Maybe if they were rolling for two or three years again, they could keep rolling, but they cannot even start now because they cannot access money. It is not available from any Irish bank, and if they get money it is at a cost of 10% or 12.5% and it is from outside the country. That is not fair. If the Government does not address these two issues, it can keep developing strategies and printing books and papers, but it will not result in houses and we will finish up where we are, that is, nowhere.	spk_48

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-10-12	dail	32	Financial Resolution No. 2: General (Resumed)	dbsect_4	Stay-at-home parents and families have been discriminated against in this budget. They are not happy about the child care programme that is being rolled out because their needs have not been considered at all. Everyone in this country should be cherished and treated equally, but this section of our community - young families - is not being treated fairly in budget 2017. I am speaking for these people, who are working very hard and trying to survive with little help from anyone. They are what I call low to middle-income earners and they would welcome the opportunity of being able to go out to work to support the family income. However, they are not getting a chance to do so in this budget. There has been a lot of repetition in the Dáil Chamber, and every Member is entitled to speak and highlight what they consider important, but I do not know if there has been mention of the fact that there has been no increase in the budget for county roads, class 3 roads and general maintenance. Every Member coming into this House knows the serious problem of ponding on our roads. It is happening on national secondary and national primary routes as well. Serious ponding occurs in heavy rain because the local authorities for the past number of years have not been able to carry out the normal drainage programme they used to undertake going back years. This programme was important for the safety of drivers travelling on the roads on dark nights. Each and every one of us knows what happens when we drive into a savage pool of water after heavy rain. We cannot see the road or where we are on it and a wave of water is up on the windscreen. If there are cars coming against us, we do not know if we will avoid them or they us. It is a serious matter. People who are paying massive tax for their motor cars and vehicles and large amounts of VAT on diesel and petrol before they can go on the roads cannot understand where the money is going or how it is being spent. They feel it should be spent on the roads on which they are travelling, and I agree with them. It is not happening and has not been happening for the past number of years. Local councillors have been on to me today again. Until 2011, the local authority would receive in the third quarter of the year what was known as discretionary funding. The councillors could nominate two or three roads that were not on the roads programme but were no longer traversable since the three-year roads programme was put in place. Sadly, these roads are not being addressed and many of them are in an awful state. I cannot see, with the amount of money that is put forward in the budget for county and local roads, that there will be any change to that this year. This is to be deplored and must be rectified. I spoke this morning about housing. I will refer again to social housing first. Until recently, there were four stages before a local authority would get approval to build a scheme of houses. That has been changed, but local authority officials are still not happy. It has been reduced to one stage if they want to go down that route. However, they have been advised that the Department will not cover any other expenditure that might be needed in the course of building the houses if the original figure agreed on varies upwards and that they will have to cover the extra cost.This is not fair. Where will they get this funding if it is required? This is another stumbling block that is preventing local authorities from providing social housing.  The procurement system effectively rules out small local builders being awarded contracts because only large national building firms will meet the financial requirements set down under procurement rules. Companies bidding for contracts must have a certain turnover and given that no building work has been done in rural counties in the past seven or eight years, local builders do not have any turnover. However, they have the ability and know-how to build houses and they are prepared to do so. The big national companies will be awarded the contract but it is the small local companies that will do the work. They have stood the test of time and provided a good service and when something goes wrong, they are there to put it right again. As has happened before in many cases, something will go wrong and the small firms will not be fully paid. It is unfair that some of these companies will be caught again under the new procurement system.  The same procurement system will apply to the rapid build programme the Minister makes much ado about. Small building firms and contractors will build the rapid build houses, even if it is the large national companies that are awarded the contracts. No one knows if the small builders will be paid for the work they do.  I am disappointed and cannot understand the reason second hand houses have not been included in the help-to-buy scheme. The reason given was that the home renovation scheme would be extended to allow present occupiers two more years to improve their houses. This will help people who have a home, rather than those who are looking for a home. Whoever wrote the reply must have had a good few drinks at that stage because it did not give a reason for not allowing second homes to be considered under the help-to-buy scheme.  This morning, I raised with the Taoiseach two blockages that are preventing developers from building private housing schemes. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, is listening because the Taoiseach did not listen to me this morning or give me a fair, reasonable or honest answer. He also laughed at me a couple of weeks ago when I raised the issue of flooding in County Kerry. As a Deputy elected by the people of Kerry, I do not respect the Taoiseach because he laughed at people who are experiencing flooding problems in Kerry and elsewhere. I was brought up to respect everyone, including politicians and I respected every Taoiseach until now. However, if this is the respect the Taoiseach has for people in Kerry, I do not have much time for him. It is not fair to laugh at people who ask that something be done when flood waters have risen and come into their homes. The Taoiseach should not laugh at them. This morning, when I informed the Taoiseach about two blockages that are preventing local developers from starting to build houses, the Taoiseach did not give me much of a hearing. These companies cannot get funding from mainstream Irish banks and where they are able to secure funding from lending institutions outside the country, they are charged interest of 10% or 12.5%. The second blockage is the levies and charges they must pay up front and the taxes and VAT they must pay within two months. Something must be done about this because 37% or 38% of the cost of building a house finishes up in the coffers of the State. Surely a system could be devised to allow builders time to pay taxes and VAT.  While some developers and building contractors have a bad name, 95% of them are honest, hard-working people who want to survive and make a living, just like everyone else. If there is a problem with 5% of developers, there are methods of addressing that through the local authorities and building control regulations. I am sorry the Taoiseach did not listen to my comments on this issue and chose instead to make a joke of it by giving me an answer taken from the housing strategy that had nothing to do with the two issues I raised. If the two problems I outlined are not addressed, housing construction will be at a standstill next year and few if any houses will be built. The Government is not giving the problems presented by Brexit the recognition they deserve. The issue is causing uncertainty among farmers and others. The dramatic decline in the value of sterling has already resulted in a reduction in income of between 10% and 12% for small companies exporting to London. Brexit will affect everyone, notably the tourism sector. Hoteliers have done great work in the past three or four years turning around the tourism product. If it was not for the tourism sector, towns such as Killarney, Dingle and Kenmare in County Kerry would be very quiet places. The Oireachtas should set up a separate forum, comprised of Ministers and backbench Deputies from all parties, to work together day and night on this issue. The people who elected us are seeking guidance on Brexit and we need to have a policy to deal with it. On the day I learned about the British decision to leave the European Union, I called on the Government to ask or cajole the UK into having another referendum. While this does not seem likely, I have met people who voted to leave and are crying out for another opportunity to vote because they know they were wrong and have changed their minds. The whole country depends on the Dáil to advise how or whether we will survive Brexit and what strategy or strategies will be put in place to deal with it. This needs to be done urgently and I ask the Government to wake up and tackle the issue immediately.  The budget did not deal with school transport. Successive Governments gave undertakings that when a school closed in a certain area and its pupils were moved to a more central school, funding would be made available to ensure Bus Éireann provided school transport for pupils travelling to the central school. This agreement has not been honoured and many parents are suffering as a result. They must take children on long journeys to school and lose valuable time. Some have to bring younger children with them in the car each morning and evening, regardless of whether they are sick or tired or anything else, to ferry older children back and forth. The rules have been changed and ten children are now required to keep a school run going.In some glens and valleys, sadly, because of rural decline, they do not have free school transport. One thing the whole of the country appreciated was the free school transport that was brought in by Donogh O'Malley and that made a difference to so many families. However, it has gradually been eroded. There was a Bill in the Dáil on access to schools. People in these areas are as entitled to education as those of any other class or creed so I ask that we ensure that what is happening will be reversed. We have to see after our children, and if we do not, our country will go down the Swanee. We are talking about rural decline. Places in south Kerry have amalgamated. Even Kilgarvan, Sneem and Caherdaniel cannot have a team of their own and have to join up with two or three other teams. That gives an indication of how many youngsters are emigrating from our country to London, Australia and Canada. The worry I have is that, while they received a wonderful education, we are going to lose all their talents. Even though they mean well when they leave and they intend to come back, that is not happening. We are losing our doctors and people of many and various skills. They are our future. I am very worried we will not have the people to fill the positions that need to be filled in the future. Even at this point in time, we must ensure no more of them will go and we must work harder to ensure we have employment for them here in order to keep them in rural areas. Maybe some of the environmentalists would say they should all move into the cities, towns and villages but that is not the way I see it. A light in a glen is a sign of life. If we do not have that light, we will lose our future. I do not think we value rural Ireland as much as we should. The west is where most calves are produced and that is where our beef industry originates. If there are not enough calves, our beef industry will fall down because it is those people who get up in the middle of the night to calve the cows and mind the calves and put them suckling. It does not matter if it is raining, dry or cold, they have to get out and do that. We must appreciate that but those people have been neglected. For as long as I am here, I will keep highlighting that because rural Ireland cannot be let go. If that happens, we can forget it. There is a lot of money being spent here in Dublin. I do not begrudge the people of Dublin but it looks to me as if the aim is to get people into this city, underground or overground. They are talking about building another terminal in Dublin and fighting over where they will put it. At the same time, they let Shannon be downgraded. I do not begrudge the people of Dublin but the people in the west and other rural areas are entitled to the very same treatment. I hope the Ministers take on board what I have said. I look forward to co-operating with them as long as they co-operate with me but the treatment I got this morning from the Taoiseach, and the other day as well, is not acceptable. I do not condone him laughing at the people of Kerry or any other people when the flood is coming in their doors.	spk_194
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-10-11	dail	32	Budget Statement 2017	dbsect_3	I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak about the budget. I thank the Ministers and the Government. Every man sets out to do his best when he gets up in the morning, or at least most people try to do so, but at times their best may not be good enough. However, when they try to do their best, they have to be complimented.  It is welcome that medical cards are to be extended to children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance. Many have agitated for this extension in the past few years. It is only fair that the families who find themselves in such situations receive some solace in the budget. I welcome the increase of 2,400 in the number of teaching posts. Education is very important and if we do not a provide a proper education for children, we are going nowhere.  I welcome the €5 per week increase in the old-age pension and for social welfare recipients. However, I am disappointed that they will have to wait until practically halfway through the year for the increase to reach their pockets. One wonders whether it is next year's budget we are talking about when we are talking about having to wait until May for the increases to take effect.  I very much welcome the restoration of the Christmas bonus at the rate of 85%. It is much needed and very important for the families who depend on social welfare or pension payments for their total income. The very small reduction in the universal social charge is to be welcomed, but it is not enough. All of us here must realise that it is working people who are paying for each and every one of us to be in this House. Whether it is dark, raining, cold, snowing or otherwise, they have to go to work every morning and are not assured of anything. Some of them are farmers. Others are sole traders, hoteliers and fishermen, but they have fierce responsibilities and it is they who are keeping the country going. As a Parliament, we need to recognise that we depend on them for the whole lot. I call him the working man and we depend on him for the money to pay social welfare recipients and for all public services, as well as those working in local authorities.  I welcome the extra €500 million to be allocated to the Department of Health. However, will the Minister for Health ensure the money will go to where it is urgently and most needed? I do not want it to be consumed by the HSE such that those in need of help and assistance will see none of it. I want them to see it. Will elderly people in County Kerry be allocated more home help hours? They are not getting their fair share. We were told by the Minister in June that €900,000 had been allocated to increase the home help budget. What is happening? An 89 year old woman who was being helped two hours each week had one hour cut. I can tell the Minister that the €900,000 has not manifested itself since June. Will the closed wards in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee be opened to curb the trolley crisis that has been ongoing for the past five or six years? If that does not happen, we will not be able to appreciate the €500 million to be allocated to the Department of Health.  Will the Government open the new facility built one year and a half ago in St. Margaret's Road, Killarney to help people with mental disabilities? It cost almost €8 million, but it lies idle. We hear there is a disagreement about staffing, but there should not be. Nurses and all other staff on the front line in Kerry University Hospital and the community hospitals in Killarney, Dingle and Kenmare are open to the board, but the Government should not take from these staff, rather it should provide more staff to open the facility. I hope that is where some of the money will be going. The Minister must take responsibility. Many people feel let down because there does not seem to be accountability. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae referred to people with cataracts - I know a good few of them - who are practically blind, yet they have been told they will have to wait for two years for treatment. That is not good enough. Will the Government address the issue? It is happening in County Kerry outside my door. However, it should not be. Furthermore, if the Government is providing extra funding, it should not give it to the HSE without ensuring it will be spent properly. Likewise, youngsters in need of orthodontic treatment are being told that they will have to wait three or four years for treatment. That is not fair and we must ensure the position is reversed. Others are waiting for operations. They are being told that the surgeon is ready to operate but that he will not have a bed for them after the operation has taken place. That should not be happening. Will the Minister ensure this issue is addressed? On the child care package that has been announced, I am told that those who qualify will have to have a FETAC level 5 qualification and register with Tusla. By all accounts, from what we hear about Tusla, it has more than enough to do, if only it would do it. The rule that a person cannot become a foster parent if he or she is more than 40 years older than the child is ridiculous. I knew and still know a good few parents who were 40 years old or older when they had their own children. Who better to look after a child if something was to happen to a parent or if he or she had to go away to work than a grandparent? If the mother had to pay the full cost of childminding, she would not be able to work. If she has a second child, the honest truth of the matter is that she cannot work. There is fierce pressure on single income families who are struggling to keep going. Will the Government consider providing a better child care system for those who do want to work? I welcome the increase in the inheritance tax threshold for farmers' sons. The importance of this measure cannot be overstated. In recent years farmers' sons have refused the land that was to be handed down to them by their fathers, which had been handed down to them, because they could not afford to pay the inheritance tax and could not borrow the money needed to ensure they could take over the farm, resulting in it being sold. Taking the value of farms into account in the assessment under the fair deal scheme is very unfair. If 7.5% of the value of assets is taken into account over three years, it can amount to a massive sum and the young fellow concerned may not be able to keep going. Where will he go then? Will he have to go on the dole? He may finish up having nowhere to sleep or perhaps the Government is asking him to sleep with the crowd down the street. There are enough of them as it is. If I had my way, there would be no inheritance tax in handing down family farms because farmers have to go through an awful lot to keep a farm going. It is only an asset that ensures they have a job and most of what they make is put back in to ensure it will be left in as good or a better state than when they received it from their father before them. Young farmers, when they do take over a farm, spend a lot of money and the local economy benefits from the spin-off. There should be also a special allowance for the favoured nephew or niece or grandchild. It is often the case that it is a grandchild who inherits a farm.  Farmers are under serious pressure this year. The price of milk and beef is reducing at an enormous rate. In Castleisland mart last week the price farmers were getting was very bad such that many farmers took their livestock home. Brexit presents a very serious problem which is playing havoc in farming. I am very disappointed that grain farmers who have lost so much this year because of the bad weather have not received any compensation. The problems affecting grain farmers affect many other farmers in the beef and dairy sectors as they must pay more for grain and straw.  I welcome the increase in the number of qualifying places under the farm assist scheme and the change to allow farmers to pay less tax in a bad year.  I again note that the Macroom bypass project has been bypassed in a budget, despite the fact that the land has been acquired and the project is shovel ready. Deputy Brendan Griffin erected signs last year claiming work on the bypass was about to start. The failure to build the bypass is one of the reasons County Kerry is not attracting investment. It also affects people who travel to Cork for cancer treatment. I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, to put his shoulder to the wheel. The main street in Macroom runs outside his front door, while the mart is at his back door. Many people cannot get in or out of the mart. I ask him to use his presence in the Cabinet to ensure we will not be left out. Surely he will not leave office without having secured funding for this badly needed bypass.	spk_69
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-10-11	dail	32	Budget Statement 2017	dbsect_3	I am disappointed that funding has not been approved for local improvement schemes which are very important in County Kerry and other rural counties. This funding was included in the programme for Government - I included it when I was involved in the negotiations. Did the Minister lose the relevant page? Almost 1,000 roads in County Kerry need work to be undertaken. The last half mile of road to a person's door is the most important and people in County Kerry are as entitled as those living in urban areas to have a road to their front door.	spk_71

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-10-05	dail	32	Mental Health Services: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_28	I thank the Sinn Fein Party for bringing forward this motion and giving us an opportunity to raise this important matter. I will start off by asking again that the HSE open Deer Lodge in St. Margaret's Road in Killarney, a purpose-built unit to cater for 40 patients. It cost millions of euro and has been lying there empty for over a year and a half. That is not acceptable. I raised it during the discussions on the programme for Government, I have raised it here at least twice and my brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, has also raised this matter. It is not good enough that this wonderful facility is not operating. It wrongs the people of Kerry, and certainly the surrounding areas of Killarney, that this facility is not available to those who need it. The HSE is proposing to close down Lantern Lodge in New Road in Killarney and to move those who attend there to Leawood House. Apparently, the facilities that the 18 or 19 patients who attend Lantern Lodge enjoy will not be available to them in Leawood House. I certainly will not accept that, and the people of Killarney and the surrounding area will not accept it. Mental health issues and depression leading to suicide is a serious problem. People can be born with mental health problems and have depression all their lives and there are others whose depression is caused by pressure and stress. Starting off as children, they may experience stress at school and college, with examinations or whatever, or other family problems. It can be caused by a relationship break-up, the death of someone close to them, financial problems, loneliness and, indeed, rural isolation, which has happened in rural areas in Kerry on too many occasions. People in very remote places have no recreational outlet. They do not meet anybody anymore. The creamery is gone, the post office is gone, and they cannot have a couple of drinks and drive home because of our stringent laws. I asked for a two-tier system where those in rural areas would be allowed get a permit through the Garda to drive on certain roads after having two or, maybe, two and a half pints. That was not entertained by the previous Government and I do not think this Government is interested in it either. The Department of Health and the HSE need to up their game to recognise that some people need one-to-one care and assistance because we had a terrible situation again in recent times in Kerry and it is happening too often. Not enough funding is made available in the budget to deal with mental health issues. I am asking that more funding be given to it. All of us know people who have problems, and maybe new problems, and if they are missing their social scene or not doing the things that they were always doing, we all should recognise it and try to talk to them. The duty of care is to mind our neighbours and we should all try to do better for them.	spk_310
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-10-05	dail	32	Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_29	The assessment of farmers' land for the fair deal scheme is very unfair. I am not sure whether the stock on the land would be valued as well and thrown into the mix. This issue is creating stress and concern for the son or whoever is taking charge of the farm in that they might be landed with this unreasonable cost. It is unfair. It is their asset for generating income. In many cases it has been handed down from father to son going back years. If this rule is applied, some young farmers will not be able to continue to farm or make ends meet. I was made aware of a problem facing a publican who lived in the pub. His wife needed to go into a nursing home but they encountered the same problem. The same problem is being faced by publicans and small shopkeepers who live over their shops or in the premises from which they operate their business. That is not fair. We need to address this problem for people applying for the fair deal scheme as soon as possible because it is very serious and is causing great concern to many people. I do not believe the plain packaging of cigarettes will be of any benefit or use because as all Members are aware, cigarettes are an addiction.It does not make any difference whether it is in a mug or a box, people will get a cigarette when they really need it. The shape or colour of that box will not prevent them from buying it. However, I believe the battle is being lost. There is a lovely congregation of youngsters in the Gallery who should hear this point. It appears to me that more youngsters than ever are smoking. I can understand that in the case of people gone by or who now are moving on in years, there were no Government warnings or health warnings when they started smoking. However, I am very disappointed the youngsters do not appear to be heeding the health warnings at present. I am worried because as all Members are aware, they have caused many people to depart this life long before they should have. The issue must be addressed with some other type of campaign because sadly, the youngsters do not appear to be heeding the health warnings they have been getting. I must raise a few important matters in respect of health. Health is wealth and it is not good enough that in a hospital like Cork University Hospital, people must wait for four weeks for surgery to get a triple or quadruple bypass after having a heart attack. The reason is no beds were available for the patient's recovery after the surgery and that is not good enough. Can the Minister of State imagine the distress one man's family endured for almost four weeks while waiting for a badly-needed operation? This cannot be allowed to continue. I am familiar with another case in which another person is waiting in a primary care centre at present to get a bed and to be operated upon. The reason the operation is delayed is because no bed is available for the patient after the operation. This is not good enough. Many people approach me in my clinics or contact me on the telephone in respect of cataract operations, which are at a standstill in County Kerry. It is sad to think of a man I met a couple of weeks ago who only has 20% vision left in his second eye but who has been told he must wait for another two years. That man is almost stone blind and is afraid to go out. He lives in a town but cannot go down the street. He is a prisoner, marooned inside his house. That is not good enough and I ask the Minister of State to relay the message that this must be dealt with and treated as being extremely urgent. As for orthodontic treatment, youngsters in County Kerry are told they must wait for three or four years. This is not good enough because their gums then will become too strong, the treatment will not be as effective and they probably will have lost teeth by the time they are treated. Such matters must be a priority in the budget. I do not know whether it is a matter of money or whatever but it must be seen to and dealt with and I ask the Government to do just that. On home help, I was told that County Kerry was to receive €900,000 for home help out of the funding of €40 million the Minister made available to improve health services nationwide. This week, however, an 89 year old woman born in 1927 had two hours of home help per week cut to one hour, which I cannot understand. The sad part is I can see no accountability. If a question is asked at the regional health forum in the county buildings in Cork, one is told they will write to the Minister or Department of Health. In the Dáil, the answer invariably is the Minister will contact the Health Service Executive. That is not good enough and this system must be changed in order that someone is accountable to someone else. Members are accountable to the people who elect us; they will not elect us unless we do what they ask of us. In the same way, those who are responsible for delivering the health service should be accountable to the Minister, the Government or the elected representatives because I cannot see them doing what the people want or what is needed and urgent matters are being held up. People are being held up because they only have a medical card. Can the Minister of State imagine telling an 83 year old man he must wait for a year and a half or for two years before having a hip operation? That man stays awake every night until he is worn out. He does not fall asleep until some time around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and he hears the clock striking every hour throughout the night. It is wrong to leave elderly people to suffer in pain after what they have given to the country over the years. It is no way to treat elderly people and the same is true of knee operations. Such people are obliged to wait too long and are enduring too much pain. I reiterate to the Minister of State that the HSE must be made more accountable to the Department, the Minister and the elected representatives.	spk_340

It is hard to believe it as the sun is shining here today but parts of County Kerry have had incessant rain for the past 24 to 36 hours. Waterville is cut off from Cahirciveen. The reason for this flooding across the country is because all our rivers are clogged up and blocked. There is a problem relating to Inland Fisheries Ireland that needs to be dealt with. Consultation and dialogue needs to take place between Inland Fisheries Ireland, the OPW, the local authorities, farmers, property owners and CFRAM. I ask the Taoiseach to arrange this dialogue because it is not happening at all. It is too slow and Inland Fisheries Ireland is not allowing work to clear out our rivers to take place.

Not only are they talking about moving 17 people out of these wards, they are also talking about closing down the entire facility. We are told this is a HSE national policy that was ordained in 2011. One size does not fit all and I am sorry but many of these people are not fit to live on their own. I saw that for myself on Friday last. We would all be delighted if some of those at the facilities could make it in the outside world but it is my firm belief - and that of many of those involved - that this is only an attempt by the HSE to throw responsibility back on the families. These are old people and it is difficult enough for them to mind themselves. They are brothers and sisters with their own families and are involved in a tough struggle to survive as matters stand.

Hospital beds are not available for patients who need operations and those operations are being held up. I ask the Minister of State to determine how much time HSE officials have spent on this project. Is this how valuable money is being spent?

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-09-28	dail	32	Road Traffic Bill 2016 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_8	"I am glad to get the opportunity to raise a number of points about safety on our roads. I hope some of the things I will mention will be considered in the Road Traffic Bill we are discussing. Safety on our roads has been compromised by a number of things, including the lack of proper speed limits. I highlight the example of the N22 going into Killarney. For several years, we have raised this issue with Kerry County Council and have asked that the speed limit be reduced going through Glenflesk where the people go to Mass at 7 o'clock. On a winter's evening it is very dangerous. They park at the side of the road and have to cross to the church but the maximum speed limit applies here. For years we have been asking for this to be reduced, as it is in Lissarda, County Cork, over the hill from us. It is the same N22 road. The request has fallen on deaf ears. The people of Kerry are entitled to the same treatment and their lives are as important as those of the people in Cork. The same applies at Lissivigeen where the speed limit is reduced to 60 km/h just to go through the roundabout. After going through the roundabout the speed limit again increases to the maximum 100 km/h for about 900 m. In between there is a junction where many people have been badly hurt and maimed going up to Coolcaslagh. I was there one night when people were cutting the roof off a car and the young man inside was as pale as the sheet of paper in my hand. He said to me, ""Danny, can you get me out of here?"" I have not forgotten that yet. All it takes is to have the sign changed. I was not alone in raising this in Kerry County Council. If we are to talk about enhancing safety on our roads, these are the kinds of issues the RSA should be considering. A number of years ago the speed limit on local roads was changed to 80 km/h. On some of these roads a driver can do no more than 25 km/h or 30 km/h - that is the ambient speed. However, it gives the right to someone to go mad and drive up to 80 km/h on these roads. People are terrified trying to access the roads from their homes. In some cases children are just inside the walls scared of their lives. These roads need to be assessed with a view to applying proper speed limits. We also need to recognise the increased volume of traffic. We are talking about safety. Approaching Killarney, there are about six junctions, including one at Woodlands Road and one at the top of the Lewis Road where there have been many crashes with people badly hurt. No recognition has been given to any elected representative who raised this previously. Lewis Road on the bypass is a newly constructed road - constructed in the past 20 years. There is another one at the Madam's Hill. They are all on the national primary road. At Farranfore village people turn left for Dingle - the whole world is going that way - and that is also a very dangerous route. We asked for a mini-roundabout to make that safe until the bypass is built but no one is listening. I have another issue with the bodies regulating lorries and buses on our roads. I understand we have four of them. First, there is the CVRT and the Department that deals with that. We all agree that vehicles must be in a proper condition to go on the road. In case it might be mentioned later, let me say that I own buses and lorries but I am not talking for myself. I am talking about all the bus operators and hauliers. For the CVRT to test a lorry or a bus here, it costs €330 but it only costs £90 in Britain or the North of Ireland. That anomaly should be addressed to give fair play to Irish operators. It costs €114 for an agricultural jeep in Ireland but only £31 in Britain or the North of Ireland. Along with the CVRT, we have to deal with the RSA. A lorry driver could have his lorry tested one day and go out on the road. Two days later the RSA might stop him for whatever it might find and could put him off the road for a week or a month even though the lorry has passed the district CVRT and complied with everything.Another agency, the Freight Transport Association, FTA, a UK body, can do the same. One operator told me that the FTA told him he was required to keep a hammer in the vehicle to break the glass in an emergency. His PSV officer told him he was not required to keep a hammer in the vehicle as that was only required under English law. The level of over-regulation and cross-regulation in this area is hurting operators. Another serious issue is the overgrowth of hedges and bushes on our roads. This is dangerous to people using our local roads, in terms of their almost having their eyes picked out, and it is the cause of many serious accidents on other roads. Last winter, I was driving behind a lorry that knocked a branch off a tree which landed on the road in front of my car. If that branch had hit a school bus it could have forced the bus driver off the road and resulted in children being injured or killed. Drivers are being exposed to great danger on our roads. According to environmentalists we cannot cut hedges at a particular time of the year even though that is the time of year they most need to be cut. As I said on many occasions in Kerry County Council Chamber birds are not so foolish as to make their nests outside a ditch on a busy road or on the branch of a tree overhanging the road because if they did they would be blown to smithereens or their feathers would be blown all over the road leaving them naked. The birds are not that foolish. The cutting of hedges, bushes and trees should be permitted all year round for the safety of the people. While the level of regulation on drivers and vehicles is ever increasing our roads are not safe. I hope I am getting the message across to the Minister. There is an unfairness in terms of the way in which the law regarding the cutting of bushes and hedges is being interpreted. I have been travelling to and from Dublin for many years. The hedges and bushes on our motorways are cut at least twice a year. Not even a briar is allowed to grow on the motorways but local authorities are not even permitted to issue letters to landowners in relation to the cutting of hedges and bushes on local roads until 1 September, which is ridiculous because at that time of the year the leaves, briars and so on disintegrate. At the time when hedges and bushes most need to be cut they are not being cut. I am asking the Minister to raise this issue with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and to ensure that something is done about it. We are still awaiting promised legislation in this regard. At a meeting two years ago of Kerry County Council we were told that the Minister would be introducing legislation that would provide for an increase in the permitted cutting time by one month. That has not happened. It is important our roads are safe all year round. In some areas, foresters - I am not speaking specifically about Coillte - are permitted to plant to the edge of a road. That should no longer be permissible. No tree should be within falling distance of a road. Falling trees can kill people as, sadly, has happened in Kerry, leaving a young woman and her children without a husband and father. We must prevent this happening. As I understand it, in France no bush or tree is allowed to be planted within falling distance of the road. I am asking the Minister to review the law in this area, which is unfair on the people travelling our roads. The volume of traffic on our roads is ever-increasing. If an assessment in that regard is not carried out our roads will become clogged up and unsafe. We need to invest in our roads. There is 4,000 km of road in Kerry. Many of those roads were built two centuries ago. Listry Bridge in Kerry was built 260 years ago. It is located on the main artery between Killarney and Dingle. The Minister will be aware of the large volume of traffic that passes over that bridge every day during the summer. The bridge can be accessed by only one vehicle at a time such that if a driver who is not familiar with the bridge progresses across the bridge while another vehicle is coming in the other direction there could be a crash. There have been several crashes on that bridge. Many of our bridges were built in the 1800s and only some of them have been upgraded slightly since then. Given the volume of traffic on our roads it is important the safety of our roads into the future is addressed."	spk_191
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-09-28	dail	32	Water Charges: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	This is a very contentious issue. Like everybody else, I would love to have free water and for everyone to have free water. However, it appears that this motion is designed to give one section of the people free water. What concessions will be given to people in rural Ireland who have their own water pumps and septic tanks and to farmers and business people who have been paying for water for years? They have been paying to get public water. What will happen to them? Will they get free water? There is a cost to providing water. I should have said at the outset that people could construe that I have a conflict interest on this matter because my father, uncle, myself and my son have been repairing water pipes at different times for the past 60 years or so. If everybody is going to receive free water, that is fine. The question is how it will be paid for. People in rural Ireland who have septic tanks had to jump a high bar to be allowed to install the septic tank and then they had to pay up to €14,000 or €15,000 to install it. They must also keep it maintained. It is fine to say that we must clear up the sewage on Dalkey strand when somebody is not paying for it. As I speak, there are inspectors from Kerry County Council inspecting septic tanks to ensure they are in order. That happens in every county. The people who own the tanks will have to repair them if they are not in order. Will those people get assistance to maintain their septic tanks? Will people whose home will not be attached to a public sewerage scheme get money to install a free septic tank? We must be fair about it. People in rural Ireland will have to be looked after as well. These are people who have paid to install water pumps. They must keep them going even though they give a lot of trouble. Perhaps they can avail of gravity flow but that costs money as well. These people provide water for themselves but they must pay for it. It is galling to think that those people, in some way under the name of taxation, will have to pay for another section of the community to have free water and free sewerage. I cannot see that as fair. Furthermore, what about all the young fellows who are working and have no house, water or septic tank? They are paying rent and paying for other things but they do not have a house or property of their own. These are hard working people. Are they going to be taxed more to fund free water? That question must be answered. Regardless of the party involved, and the parties are fighting among themselves about words, the fact is that it costs money to provide water. If it is not going to be paid by some people who are using it, who will pay for it and how much extra will they have to pay to ensure that other people will have free water? I want free water as much as anybody else. I would take it as well. I use a great deal of water. In fact, I am robbed by water. Any Members who are farmers will know what happens with water troughs. They leak and one might not see it because one was not down in that field. In the meantime, a fortune in water has gone down the drain unused and we still must pay for it. There is much talk about abolishing water charges. What should and must be done is to provide a waiver system for people who just cannot pay. There should be a system in place for those people to ensure they are not put under duress and tormented by bills if they cannot pay. They might be disabled people or people who do not have the wherewithal, even if they are not getting social welfare. I urge Members to consider what I have said because it is a very serious matter. The water does not come from the sky into the pipes. It costs money to replace and extend pipes and to treat the water. Where will the money come from? Members talk about general taxation and progressive taxation. That is money out of the pocket of some fellow who is working. The working people will take no more. The working man is paying enough and if Members try to shove it on him, he will have parties here in Dublin that they will not forget.	spk_336

The Minister for Health is not here but I need an answer from him in relation to €40 million that he made available for health services in June. Kerry was to receive €900,000 of this for the provision of extra home help in the county. The opposite is happening. One old man had the two hours of home help he had cut to an hour. Another elderly man of 95 years of age is paying €240 for his own home help and to go to the day centre for extra home help. Where is the €900,000 gone? I need an answer on this because the HSE is not giving us any reasonable answer as to where the money is or what it is doing with it. It is certainly not going into home help anyway.	spk_102

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-07-20	dail	32	Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 [Seanad]: Committee and Remaining Stages	dbsect_3	Since being elected to this House, I and the other representatives from Kerry have highlighted our dissatisfaction with home help provision for elderly people in our county, which is unacceptable. We raised the issue many times in the discussions on the programme for Government, on the Order of Business and at other times here, but nothing has changed in Kerry with regard to improving home help services. This Government will be judged on its ability to make a difference to the people we represent. I believe that the people who need home help are not getting a sufficient number of hours. I know of many cases where the husband and the wife are trying to stay in their home but they are not getting a sufficient number of home help hours. A half hour in the morning and a half hour in the evening for five days is not sufficient in terms of helping people to get out of bed, give them a meal or whatever. Very little can be done in that short time. The home helps are wonderful people and they stay longer than they are paid to do. I am aware of an elderly couple that is using the pension of one of them to provide a home help. That is not acceptable. Very few people get a home help on a weekend. That is not acceptable. They do not get a home help on bank holidays. I mentioned previously that home help was taken from people on Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day and New Year's Day. That is a time of peace and goodwill when we are all supposed to look after each other, but especially elderly people. That is the service our State is providing. It appears to me that there is no accountability in this area. The HSE is not accountable to the Minister for Health, but the buck should stop with the Minister. If we raise an issue in this House the Minister should address it and see how it can be improved. If we do not help our elderly people to stay in their homes for as long as they possibly can, we are not doing our duty. Kerry has been badly let down with regard to the provision of a sufficient number of home help hours. I ask that this matter be addressed. On another issue, Deer Lodge is a new facility that was built 12 months ago at great expense in St. Margaret's Road, Killarney, to deal with people with mental health problems, but the door has not been opened yet. That brand new facility has been lying idle for 12 months. I want the Minister to make a statement on when he will open the doors of that facility. Our county is riddled with suicides, and I am not saying that facility will stop suicides from happening in our county, but it is not acceptable that its doors are not yet open.As an elected representative, I promised many people that we would do our level best to ensure the facility would be up and running. The facility was completed in June of last year and was supposed to open in July of last year but the doors and gates are closed and it has not yet opened. I want the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, or the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, to make a statement on when it will be opened. That is the question we are being asked day in, day out. Another serious problem is manifesting itself regularly. Consider a person who has had a heart attack and goes to Cork University Hospital in the hope of having a triple or quadruple bypass. I have a constituent who was waiting for three weeks and who had to return home many times during those three weeks because when he went to the hospital, there was no bed available and the operation was cancelled. Imagine the stress and trauma that family had to endure wondering if he would get another heart attack. The operation was cancelled several times. That was not fair on the family, the patient or the patient's poor wife who could hardly sleep for those three weeks all because a bed was not available to cater for that patient following the operation. Those matters need to be addressed. Members elected to this Chamber highlight these concerns but nothing is happening. The Minister needs to make a statement on what he will do about these serious matters. I am not alone in raising these issues but I ask that they be addressed and that the Minister makes a statement on them.	spk_18

It is not acceptable. I deplore the fact he said that the local authorities had lost their ability to build houses. They could not build houses when they were not able to access money. The tenant purchase scheme, which was a great scheme that allowed tenants to purchase their houses, was dropped for three or four years. The new scheme is not accessible to many tenants who wish to purchase their houses. As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, old-age pensioners are not allowed to purchase a county council house even though they might have savings achieved over a number of years. For the last three years, we have had no tenant purchase scheme but now these people are being denied the right to purchase the house they have lived in, repaired, modified and brought up to a standard over their lifetime. They cannot buy the house because this scheme, as set out, is designed so that old-age pensioners or people on social welfare do not qualify. Another category of people who will not qualify are people who were in arrears with their rent over the last three years for one reason or another. That happens to people and they catch up again but they are being denied the right to purchase their house or go into a purchasing scheme. What that scheme actually meant for the likes of Kerry County Council was that the money that was accrued from the tenants purchasing their houses went back into the repair of voids or vacant houses. As the Department was not giving the local authorities any funding, it meant there were many houses lying idle around the county and people were asking us why such houses were vacant for such a long time. There was no money being accrued because there was no tenant purchase scheme. It is only a little better now and I am asking the Minister to modify and clear the blockages that are preventing tenants from purchasing their houses. It is having a double impact in that the voids are not being brought back to standard and cannot be offered to tenants who are waiting on the list with their thumbs up looking for some place they could call home and have security of tenure. I raised the national spatial policy with the Taoiseach yesterday. Where is the Minister directing the local authorities to dezone lands, especially around towns where there was phase 1 and phase 2 zoning? It is becoming apparent that in many of the phase 1 zoning, there is trouble with NAMA, ownership and people getting money to go forward. Phase 2 are now going to be dezoned so we will finish up with no land to build houses on. We cannot build houses if there is no land zoned to build them on. I appeal to the Minister to look at that.	spk_412

I know of 30 people working in Liebherr who cannot find a house to buy or a site on which to build a house. Will the Taoiseach direct that this process be delayed? It is wrong that any local authority would be dezoning lands in the context of current housing need. I respect the right of people and private developers to build their own houses. If lands are dezoned, we may end up in the situation of there being no land available in Killarney on which to build houses.

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-07-19	dail	32	Housing Strategy: Statements	dbsect_33	I thank the Minister for getting the ball rolling with this housing strategy. However, I will not praise the strategy until I see how it works because, as we all know, and as I know having been a member of Kerry County Council for 14 years, the devil is always in the detail and we have to see, as Deputy Mattie McGrath stated, how the blockages that we have been dealing with over the past number of years will be dealt with. The first pledge is to address homelessness. I have been told that in regard to Dublin, the making illegal of bed-sits has contributed greatly to the number of homeless sleeping on the streets. Maybe the Minister should look at how that could be overlooked or changed for the time being until we have more housing stock available. In the past six years, Kerry County Council has built three houses but, unlike the Taoiseach and the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, I do not blame the local authorities. Since early 2015, when Deputy Kelly made an announcement that we had €62.5 million in Kerry for housing, there has been no house built yet because there has been blockages with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government dealing with the applications for the social housing in places such as Killarney and Tralee. Thirty houses were to have been built in the summer of 2015 but to date there is no house built because there were four stages of approval demanded by the Department. Those four stages seem to go on forever. That is where I am asking the Minister to get involved and provide the staff, and ensure that the staff deal with the issues because there should only be one model for local authorities to deal with in respect of each type of housing. Whether it is a one bedroom, two bedroom, three bedroom, four bedroom or five bedroom house, there should be one model for the country. The current situation has been causing unreal delays in getting 30 houses built in Kerry. I ask the Minister to address that aspect. If we are to provide more housing, we need more staff. As I understand it, even at present there is an embargo on local authorities getting staff. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, are shaking their heads. I know the blockages are still there because I deal with them every day. I go to Kerry County Council at least once a week, every Monday. I know what is happening there. There are still blockages. They do not have the additional staff. It was disingenuous of the Taoiseach to criticise the local authorities and lay the blame at their doorstep because they are not to blame. I can tell the Taoiseach - I will make no bones about it - I will be more critical of him than his own party colleague, Deputy Griffin, if this does not work or if he does not put his shoulder to the wheel and ensure that it does. On the pledge to increase speed of delivery of social housing, I hope that this process will be streamlined and, as I stated, more staff will be put in place. On the pledge to increase the output of private housing to meet demand, the private builders tell me they cannot access funding or capital at present to build the houses and that when they do, they are charged an interest rate of 12%. They cannot work with that because, they tell me, in a €180,000 house they will only have a €4,000 or €5,000 profit. They cannot take all of the responsibility and deal with all of the liabilities for that little gain. Something has to be done with the banks that we are supposed to own. On the pledge to utilise existing housing, I highlighted this at meetings of Kerry County Council which owns many such houses. When we were working on a programme for Government, I insisted that we look at these vacant properties to see if they could be brought up to scratch. I welcome this, if it can be made work. It involves a lot of work, if one gives a loan to the house owner or landlord and hopes to get back the rent after five years or whatever, but it is a laudable exercise. I ask the Minister to put extra effort into that. I hope he will do so because there are a lot of houses vacant in my county. I even know of one house in a prominent place in a street in the heart of Killarney which, they tell me, is vacant for 70 years. I wish the Minister all the best with this housing strategy. He will have to get stuck in. Many commentators say we will have holidays but I do not anticipate that the Minister will take a holiday this summer because there is a lot of work to be done. I have one other issue to raise. In County Kerry, the former national roads authority, NRA or, as it is now being called, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has deprived three couples of getting planning permission exiting onto a national secondary route. This is very unfair. Whatever regulations they are going by now were signed into law by the then Minister of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, in 2012. I ask that the Minister look into that because it is depriving many in our county of access. All they are asking for is planning permission and they are being deprived of it by this one rule by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and TII.	spk_331

Unfortunately, however, some parents have a heavy cost to bear and unfair burdens when their children become ill and may be ill for many months or many years. Maybe some of them will never get back to full health. When they look for domiciliary care allowance, to which they are entitled, I feel they have to wait much too long. I have had a case in recent times that has been going on for months now - since April - and we are told that maybe we will have an answer by the end of August. To give Deputies a small bit of an insight into the background of the case, it concerns a child who is about seven years old, one of a family of five, whose bowel and colon were removed. She has a bag and may have it until she becomes an adult, although hopefully it will be removed then and replaced with a more acceptable system for keeping her alive. In the meantime, however, the family applied for domiciliary care allowance last April and will be waiting at least until the end of August. I feel, as I suppose do all Members here and county councillors around the country, that a six-month wait is not good enough. It must be about staff. I do not think any staff in any Department would hoard an application like this, but there are not enough staff to vet these cases. It is the same with the carer's allowance. I know Deputy Mattie McGrath and others have made the case about the medical card but I am glad of this opportunity to highlight the need to speed up domiciliary care allowances for children. A sick child is a serious burden to carry for parents and in the case I have mentioned it may be for the rest of her life. I ask the Government to do something and to staff these places to ensure that a speedier outcome is available to those parents who apply for domiciliary care allowance.	spk_375

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-07-12	dail	32	Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2016: Report Stage	dbsect_37	I must declare an interest. My family has a small plant hire business that has been repairing and replacing water pipes for more than 60 years in Kerry. We all realise that water is essential and that without it, none of us can survive. For various reasons, many parts of my county do not have water at certain times of the year. They do not have pipes running in front of their homes, so they must improvise by, for example, drawing water. One community in south Kerry must hire lorries and tankers to bring it water practically every day from April until the middle or end of September. I hope that some geniuses decide in the coming months that it will be grand for everyone to have free water. I would support that because I also would like to have free water but many people on group schemes in my county have been suffering trying to keep their schemes working, their water treated and their pipes repaired. It costs money constantly to keep water flowing in those pipes. Another set of people have wells, pumps and private supplies of their own but keeping the water coming into their homes costs money. They must provide their own septic tanks but even before they can place those, people need to get planning permission for them, undergo site assessments and meet planners' strict regulations. Some treatment systems can cost up to €14,000 or €16,000. Many young couples have had to go through all of this recently to comply with the new standards and regulations. People in group sewerage schemes experience a lot of trouble. It costs a lot to enter the schemes at the outset. I know of numerous communities around Killarney and the rest of Kerry seeking to have group sewerage schemes sanctioned but they may have to wait for three, four or five years. They have been waiting for the past five years but there is no word that they will be assisted in this regard. Over the years, farmers and business people have been paying continuously for water from the public supply. They have been glad to get it. The only trouble they have is when the water system breaks down. They really start to complain when they do not have water. They may be without it for only a short few hours but they need to get the supply restored as soon as possible. Until they have the water back again, they are not happy, as everybody here can understand. If we are to have free water for all, all those people who have paid their charges up to now will have to be refunded. Irrespective of what committee is to vet these proposals, it will have to consider that people in group water schemes, or with wells, pumps and septic tanks, and those in group sewerage schemes will have to be helped and subsidised. Their group schemes will have to be brought up to standard, as will their wells, and they will have to be funded so there will be equality in all sections of society. There is much to be considered. I would dearly love it if everybody could have free water, but I do not know how that would be achieved. I have been repairing pipes myself over the years and noted water does not get into them without a lot of work and without someone ensuring they are maintained and repaired. The water must be treated, which costs money. Some people say water will be paid for through progressive taxation. Maybe they are going to raise income tax, and maybe the people in the schemes I have been talking about will be asked to pay so others can have free water.	spk_751

How was the HSE so slow in finding out how these massive sums of money were being misappropriated? Why was there not more thorough vetting of how the money was being spent?Several senior administrative staff vet each application for home help services. Why did proper checks and balances not apply in a case involving such large amounts of taxpayers' money? It would not be unreasonable to expect the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance to have copped on to this matter much sooner. This issue will affect the poor people who spend rainy days on street corners and at various events collecting donations in buckets to help vulnerable people. It will also affect the good people who always contribute to such collections. I have sympathy for those who do great work on behalf of their local communities and organisations that provide help to vulnerable people because it is they who will be affected by these malicious acts involving, as Deputy Mattie McGrath stated, the plunder and pillage of funds. It is disgraceful that the Health Service Executive provided such large sums of money without properly accounting for the way in which it was spent. On the one hand, it provides large sums of money without checking where or how they are spent, while, on the other, it deprives people of home help services at weekends, bank holidays and even on Christmas Day by refusing to fund them.	spk_874

This project is of paramount strategic importance to all the people of Kerry, all those who travel to Cork and back every day for work and the many hundreds of people from Kerry who have to travel to consultants and doctors in Cork University Hospital, Mercy University Hospital and South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital. For people who have to go for radiotherapy to survive and for a chance to live their full lives, this is the only avenue they have to go to get that treatment. This is the place they have to go. People have to travel from as far away as Cahirciveen, Dingle and Fenit and are held up for 30 to 45 minutes going through Macroom.As the Minister will be aware, we are surrounded to the west by the Atlantic Ocean, and the N22 route, to Cork city and to the motorway to Dublin, is a heavily trafficked route. Kerry County Council has come as far as it can to the top of the county bounds. Surely it cannot be asked to come further over into the heart of the county of Cork to make a road into Cork city to which it is very much entitled. The lack of this basic infrastructure is denying Kerry employment opportunities and is prohibiting any investment coming into our county. I understand it was one of the key reasons the Kerry Group set up its global technology innovation centre in County Kildare and cost Kerry up to 900 jobs, which, had it set up in Farranfore as was expected, would have been a massive boost to our county. This project has been sought for more than 30 years and has been firmly on the agenda for the past 20 years. However, it has been held up by environmentalists and others who thought up ridiculous reasons, such as snails and other species. To rub salt into our wounds, they described them as the Kerry snail. Did they put a Kerry jersey on him or how did they decide he was a Kerry snail? There was plenty of money around ten years ago but these people held up this project for those unreasonable reasons.	spk_17

If we continue in the present vein, I fear that Ireland will topple into the Irish Sea because all the investment is coming to the east of the country, and especially Dublin.

It comes from every sector - schools, farmers, business people, manufacturing companies, private residences, people working from home and students who want to study at home because they need to download information to progress. There are also those who wish to complete their entire courses from home and need to access information from lecturers which is often sent out at weekends when the students are at home in Kerry. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine wants farmers to fill out forms and make many applications online but the only line many of these farmers have is the clothes line in the back yard. Principal contractors who want or need to pay subcontractors or suppliers have to notify the details of the subcontractor or supplier to the Revenue Commissioners before they can legally pay them. Bed and breakfasts and guest houses need to advertise their rooms and facilities online and accept bookings online. In many parts of Kerry and rural Kerry that is impossible because they do not have the coverage. People in places like Sneem, which does not even have a bank, could pay their bills online but that is not possible. In much of this expansive area there is no broadband connection so they have to travel to Kenmare, Killarney, Waterville or Caherciveen, which are miles away.	spk_387

The coverage is diminishing at an alarming rate in places that had coverage previously. It is not a good sign when some industrialist arrives in Farranfore Airport and goes a mile out any of the three roads from the airport only to find he or she has no mobile coverage. That is not acceptable. It is denying us the prospect of bringing business into the county. I welcome the interest and commitment of the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten. He has promised that all areas and homes will be connected in the next three to five years. I am depending on the Minister to ensure, whoever the providers will be, that there will be no cherry-picking and that all rural areas, including places such as the Black Valley between Kenmare and Beaufort, and Glenmore in Lauragh, or any other secluded or remote area, will get the same service as the populated areas. I ask the Minister to ensure that he, or whoever will be Minister in the future, will be in full control and will keep these providers under their thumb. Broadband is a necessity to attract business and investment into rural and western seaboard counties. Kerry is one of these. As we are starved for jobs at present, this lack of such infrastructure is depriving the county of many industries. Every person should be entitled to this infrastructure as of right. It is not a luxury. Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin put down amendments to the Minister's proposals, and I am worried about this as it could cause further delay. The people do not mind who the provider is, whether private or in State control, as along as they get a service. They are entitled to that. Deputy Dooley remarked that it seems the Minister is a ram in the Dáil and a lamb at Cabinet. In my parish of Kilgarvan, there was a lady who used to feed a few sheep, rams and lambs for her elderly father, and she used come in and say, ""Father, I am away more in dread of the lamb than I am of the ram"".

Ireland is a small nation surrounded by water, with no road access to mainland Europe. I call on the Taoiseach, Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and our MEPs to tackle the European Commission and officials to ensure that Ireland gets vital concessions and to protect Ireland's interests. We need our experts working to their maximum to ensure a seamless transition of Britain from the Europe Union such that our agriculture, manufacturing and tourist industries are protected. The survival of our nation is at a crossroads. Trade between Ireland and the UK could be reduced by 20%. The proposal by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Osborne, to cut corporation tax there to 15% will affect Ireland in that it may result in industries choosing to set up in the UK rather than Ireland.  The issue of whether payments to farmers will be maintained under the CAP is one of the most commonly asked questions of me at my constituency clinic. Another question is whether Britain not contributing to the finances of Europe will make a difference to CAP payments. Farmers will be hit on the double because the value of sterling will fall and manufacturing and agricultural exports will be worth 10% less. Freedom of movement of our people to and from the UK cannot be made difficult or cumbersome or in any way restrictive. For more than 100 years people from Ireland have travelled to England for work to get money to help rear their families in this country. Currently, many people travel to work in the UK on a weekly basis to get money to provide for their families in Ireland. We cannot allow any travel restrictions or obstacles to be put in their way. We do not want Border checkpoints or friction with our good neighbours in Northern Ireland. Relations between us have been running smoothly since the checkpoints were removed and we want this to continue. At the same time, we need to ensure that we do not take in more immigrants or refugees than we can afford or house. I have nothing against refugees but we can only house so many of them. As Members will be aware, many of our own people cannot find homes and are sleeping in the streets, with little headway being made in that regard.  What will happen if Holland or any of the Baltic countries decide to leave the European Union? Do we have a plan B? I suggest that an all-party committee be established, comprising Deputies with expertise in marketing, taxation, business, agriculture, fishing, tourism and manufacturing and trade. As I said, free movement of our people in and out of the UK is important. The people of Ireland do not want to leave the European Union at this stage but if more countries were to leave and if the European Union were to make things difficult for Ireland in terms of our being unfairly regulated or restricted in our trading or exports, Ireland would have to consider its position. We need a plan B to deal with these eventualities. Who would have thought when we were a few short months ago that the UK would leave the European Union. Even though we knew the referendum was going to take place, we never believed the UK would leave the European Union but it has done so. As that could trigger other countries to do likewise, we need to have a plan B in place.	spk_205
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-06-28	dail	32	Questions on Proposed Legislation	dbsect_4	I want to ask the Minister for Social Protection to address an anomaly and a serious matter. The disability equality (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is required to allow ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to make further technical amendments to disability and equality law. I am seeking to highlight the denial of disability payments to our own citizens when they go abroad for treatment. I am thinking specifically of the case of a young man who has had to leave his children behind. His wife has gone with him. It is very wrong that he is being denied his disability payments because he is outside the country. He is sleeping for 22 hours. At a time when we are giving over €600 million in foreign aid, which is being administered by dictators who are buying guns with it, it would be appropriate for this man and people like him to get disability payments when they are abroad.	spk_52
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-06-28	dail	32	Equal Status (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_33	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on his new portfolio. I am sure it will be no problem to him, as he has served in many other Ministries.I have to say we do not have discrimination issues in Kerry, Killarney or Tralee. We have people of many different religious denominations attending our national schools and secondary schools. We do not have any issues. I am not aware of them anyway. I have to salute our boards of management and parents' councils for the good work they continue to do to ensure our children are properly seen after. We have no discrimination in Kerry of which I am aware. That is what I have to say. We certainly have problems in other areas of the school system. Going back the years, if a school closed in an area the Department of Education and Skills gave an undertaking - a written undertaking in many cases - to transport the children of the locality to the central school in the parish free of charge. Sadly, the Department has reneged on that promise or consideration on many occasions. This has hurt many people in rural parishes and caused a great deal of expense for those who now have to bring their children four or five miles - in some cases, the school is six or seven miles away - to school each morning and evening. If a national school bus run does not have ten children, it will not qualify under the free transport scheme. I believe this is unfair, especially as the Department of Education and Skills previously gave an undertaking to transport such children to school free of charge. I would like to mention an issue that was raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath. I refer to cases in which the older children in a family are attending a school that traditionally has been attended by members of the family in question. Three or four years ago, some bright spark decided that such children should have to attend a nearer school on the basis of a satnav or whatever. It is unfair that the younger children in this family, who would normally have been accompanied to school by their older siblings, now have to go to a different school. I believe all the children in such a family should be entitled to go to the school that was traditionally attended by their family and all the families around them. It is wrong that they are divided and separated now. This change hurt many parents when it was made three or four years ago. The school transport system needs to cater for all our children, but that is not happening at present. I will give an example. In some cases, a parent needs to have a medical card in order for his or her child to qualify for free school transport. If one parent has a medical card but the other parent does not, their children are denied free school transport. It is very unfair that families in such circumstances have to pay €350 for a school transport ticket for each of their children because many of them can ill afford such an expense.	spk_243
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-06-27	dail	32	United Kingdom Referendum on European Union Membership: Statements	dbsect_2	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this most serious matter that has arisen in recent days. To say that people are exercised about it would be to say very little. People in rural Ireland are wondering and concerned about the future. In rural areas such as County Kerry and west Cork, where I spent some time yesterday evening, people depend on the European Union for their existence. The EU has been responsible for much of the improvement in their way of life in the past 30 or 40 years. People dare only imagine what it would be like to return to those times.In this context, it should be remembered that 52% of our beef exports go to Britain. What would happen if anything was to go wrong with this market? Fully 60% of our cheese production goes to the United Kingdom, 84% of our poultry exports go to the UK and 13% of total dairy products go to the UK. If anything were to happen to these markets one cannot bear or dream to imagine the effect on rural Ireland. The story is, and always was, that when farming is going bad, the country is going bad. Another side is that business people have survived the recession and everything that brought with it. Indeed, they have gone on to be successful in exporting to London and other places in England. These people are now telling us sales are down 10% already because of the change in sterling. I hope this will recover somewhat in the coming days or in the short term. Things may stabilise and get back into shape again, and I hope that will sort it out somewhat. Reference has been made to the tourism sector. I have been told by the hoteliers in Killarney, Dingle, Kenmare and various other places that the UK market is a major part of their income. They reckon that in the short term because sterling will not buy what the English expect it to buy, they will not come in the numbers they have been coming. Those in the industry say to me that 30% or 40% of business is from the UK and that if anything were to go wrong with that, the industry would be seriously in jeopardy. Clearly, this is serious. I had hoped it would not happen. However, in recent weeks and months I became concerned that this was what would happen. I am different from Deputy Mattie McGrath, who is sitting beside me. He says he would not entertain another vote. I am asking that the people in the UK be given an opportunity to vote again. We were asked to do that for the Nice treaty. This is as serious, if not far more serious. If the Ministers in the British Government could be cajoled into having another vote in a year's time and deferring the move down the road somewhat, then maybe they would change their minds. It is clear to me why the people in England voted in this way. It was mainly to do with rules from Europe and the immigration problem. They took the view that the politicians were not listening to them and this was their way of getting the message across. People are concerned about what this will mean for the Border. Some people have even asked me whether Dundalk would become the new Tallaght. Certainly, I have no wish to see the Border back between us and the people of Northern Ireland, because it would only bring back memories of the troubled times and what that meant for people above and below the Border. We do not want to go back to that situation, but clearly we must have a plan in place. Like most Members, while I would welcome refugees into the country, I believe we must be able to cater for them. Thoroughly vetted refugees are no problem and we should do our best for them, but it must be remembered that at present we do not have sufficient housing for our own people. In that vein, I put a question to Kerry County Council when the suggestion came up about coping with refugees. I asked for the Taoiseach and the Government to put in place separate housing, funding and housing officials to deal with those applications, because clearly the local authorities have not had sufficient capacity or funding in recent years. This should be provided before we can entertain a major increase in the population. We must have a strategy in place to deal with anything like that. Clearly, there are Deputies in this Chamber who, like the people in Britain, would like us to opt out of Europe. What plans have they in place if we move out or take ourselves out of Europe? I always take the view that if we are going to leave one place, then we should have somewhere else to go. Otherwise we are going to finish up in no man's land. I am putting that question to those people. Boris Johnson and his companions were propagating the idea of getting out of Europe. However, they have gone into hiding and in the past two or three days there has been no word from them. They have no direction. All I heard Boris Johnson say was a remark about deferring it a little. Did he not think of where he would go before he advised people which way to vote? From listening to the debates in recent weeks it is clear the British Government did not spell out all the good reasons why the UK should remain in Europe. Now, the result is going to cause havoc for the entire European Union. For this reason I am calling on the Taoiseach and his Ministers to do everything possible to talk to the Prime Minister of Britain, whether or not he is going, or else to the new fellow who takes his position. They should talk about the possibility of renegotiating and holding another vote. It is important for us to go down that route, because if other European countries ask to leave or hold a referendum, then in a short time we could have a complete break-up of the European Union. Certainly, that would not serve the people of Ireland well. I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to do his very best to ensure that the UK people are given another crack at it. Already, some 3.5 million people have signed a petition to allow them to vote again. Perhaps someone could explain properly the pros for Europe. That should be done in a determined fashion in future.	spk_18
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-06-22	dail	32	The Arts: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_31	I want to ask for financial support for rural and local festivals around the country because by means of these festivals and fair days and vintage rallies and so forth people and parishes retain their identities. This is the last bastion or way they have of showing their individual identities. Kenmare Fair Day on 15 August is the big day in Kenmare. It costs more now to stage these events because of insurance and different rules and licences and regulations. If it was not for the likes of that and the horse fair in Castleisland and the World Fiddle Day in Scartaglin those places would lose their identity. Everyone knows about Puck Fair and the value and expenditure it means for the people of Kerry. All these places are under pressure to retain and stage these events. I am asking for support for those events in whatever way possible. We have to thank the local authorities which help as well as they can but they have only so much money to give and that is limited. They have been meting it out like the loaves and fishes. It is hard to please everyone. We need to consider that so that local places can retain their identities. I feel very hurt about the fact that local characters who used to come to public houses and demonstrate their storytelling, singing, playing the fiddle and accordion impromptu are no longer able to do that because they are rurally isolated in their homes. They are trapped because they cannot come to the pub and drive home after having two or three pints. The rules and drink driving regulations treat them in the same way as the vast traffic on motorways, regional roads, national primary and secondary roads. They are being treated in the same way on minor small roads where there is hardly any traffic. These people are isolated at home and the tourists are not meeting them now as they used to in the public houses.	spk_235
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-06-22	dail	32	Revised Estimates for Public Services 2016 (Resumed)	dbsect_32	I want to highlight what has happened in my neck of the woods, in Sneem and Lauragh. Sneem, which always had two gardaí and a sergeant, is reduced to a part-time garda who is only available for an hour now and then. At certain times of the year the population of Sneem trebles and more, with an influx of visitors from all over the world. Lauragh Garda station was closed down two years after €300,000 had been spent on it. Lauragh is 17 miles from Kenmare, the nearest Garda station on the eastern side, and 20 miles from Castletownbere, the next nearest Garda station. The Minister should review that and see how wrong it was to do that to the people on the southern side of Kenmare Bay. The people of Sneem are 17 miles from Kenmare Garda station, 30 miles from Killarney Garda station and 37 miles from Cahirciveen Garda station. It cannot be right that the entire area is not properly policed and gardaí are not visible on the ground. They do their best and come from the nearest Garda stations now and then, but it is not enough. In that vast expanse of Kenmare Bay, all the piers along each side of the bay are open now for the delivery and importation of drugs. There is nothing in the world to stop it because the drug runners will know that when the Garda car is parked in Kenmare, Killarney or Cahirciveen it is not in Sneem or Lauragh or along the bay. I ask the Minister to review that decision urgently and put a full complement of gardaí into Sneem Garda station and do likewise in Lauragh for the protection and safety of the people, because it takes too long for a Garda car or presence to arrive when something happens.	spk_284
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-06-22	dail	32	Revised Estimates for Public Services 2016 (Resumed)	dbsect_32	Great news, a Cheann Comhairle. I wish to raise a number of matters with our new Minister for Social Protection and to wish him well in his role as Minister of that Department. Many problems have been created in recent years which made it difficult for people who wished to get on community employment, CE, schemes as well as those in the Department trying to administer them. One problem is that a person has to be unemployed for 12 months before he or she can go on the CE scheme. Someone who finds a place on a scheme is denied going on it until he or she is 12 months unemployed. In other words, people are being denied the opportunity of staying in the workforce and that is very wrong. Will the Minister address this problem? A period of three months may be more appropriate. It would give them a chance to get rolling again and to get back into the workforce. Another rule is the year 2000 rule. If a person was on a scheme and accumulated six years of work on the scheme, he or she will be denied the possibility of going on the scheme after the six years has passed. A person aged 58 years or 59 years will not be able to go on the scheme any more. In other words, they will have no opportunities and will be locked inside at home. They will have no opportunity to get out and feel like they are doing good for anyone. They are waiting to get the pension and that is their only outlook. This was not the case before the year 2000. Will the Minister examine this rule and see if it can be changed? Until four or five years ago, scheme entitlements could be interchanged between husbands and wives and partners and spouses. This suited, in particular, farmers, who were in receipt of farm assist payments, in the summer time. They could swap with their wives who would be allowed to go on the scheme instead of them while there was work to be done on the farm or other work that needed attention. This was a very sensible option but the option is now denied them. Approximately four years ago, the rule was changed and they are now denied that opportunity. Everywhere in the country - take a place like Kilgarvan - there is another stupid rule. If three people on the scheme reach the age of 62 together, only one can remain on the scheme. People operating the scheme will have to send two people home. They will have to draw their names out of a hat and, depending on how they organise it, the fellow that stays in the hat stays working and the other two have to go home. That is wrong. I am asking that that rule be changed as well and that they are all given the chance to work until the age of 66 years when they reach the pension age. The other rule is that a person has to be 25 years of age before he or she can go on one of these schemes. It is very wrong that youngsters have to stay at home and that they have to be 25 years before they can go on the scheme and go work in graveyards or GAA fields or something like that. I refer to lone parents, especially young girls who get in the family way and have a child, which is a joy. However, they need assistance to get them started and until four or five years ago, they were able to get double payments. They were able to get their social welfare payment and they were allowed to go on the CE scheme and work. This has changed and they are now denied that possibility. There is no incentive for them to work now because they will get the same amount under the scheme as they would get under the lone parent scheme if they stay at home.	spk_411
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-06-22	dail	32	Revised Estimates for Public Services 2016 (Resumed)	dbsect_32	I also want to mention carer's allowance because it is very important. It takes 19 weeks before applications for carer's allowance are even assessed. I know a man who applied in February and it was only the other day, after 19 weeks had passed, that the Department wrote to him looking for additional information. The application was not looked at until then. That is very sad and very wrong. A person will have pulled out of his or her job to stay at home and mind an elderly mother or father but it is 19 weeks before the application for carer's allowance is even looked at. That is very wrong and we must do something about it. Two or three weeks would be bad enough but 19 weeks is not on at all. Domiciliary care allowance applications take six months to process, which is too long as well. Will the Minister also look at that issue? In September 2012, the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, changed the number of contributions needed to get pensions. Someone with the same number of contributions after September 2012 as someone with contributions before then is getting far less money. Will the Minister examine the issue and see how it can be addressed? It is not fair. A person who became of pension age in September 2012 gets much less in his or her pension than someone who became of pension age in August 2012. That has to be addressed.	spk_414

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-06-21	dail	32	Order of Business (Resumed)	dbsect_6	My question is on behalf of the farming community in Ireland. It was never worse off and I hope the new Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is aware of that. There are four main issues at present. The first is the price of milk. Never before has a community had to work for an amount below what it costs to produce a product. People are getting less than what it costs them to produce it.	spk_100
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-06-21	dail	32	Order of Business (Resumed)	dbsect_6	Yes, the support for agriculture in that programme. Another issue is that if the blue card of an animal states that the animal moved more than four times into four different herds, one will get €50 or €60 less for that animal in the factory. This is simply because there were more than four movements for that animal. Then there is the price of fertiliser, plastic, tyres and batteries, even though oil has never been at a lower price. We were always told that the price of oil dictated the price of these items. Why is it that the costs have gone beyond the beyond? Farmers are being driven down into the ground. They are in a desperate state. They do not have a bob or a copper, and the new Minister should know that.	spk_102

The Minister for Health should inform parents and create awareness about the possible side effects of this drug. They complain of the lack of aftercare following the administering of the vaccine, that they were not given proper information prior to giving permission for their daughters to receive the vaccine, and that they are not listened to or taken seriously by health officials. The side effects listed after this vaccine are swollen glands, aching muscles, unusual tiredness or weakness, tightening in arms, legs and upper body, becoming less active in sports, attending school less, an inability to concentrate, headaches, joint pain and desire to sleep all day, and lack of energy, even to have a shower. This lack of energy leads to weight gain, which is upsetting for teenage girls and causes depression. We are not doctors and do not have technical knowledge but there is too much of this happening and I met a lot of it when canvassing for the last general election and the council election.

In County Kerry and especially south Kerry we have a wonderful collection service provided by a privately operated company giving local employment and a very punctual service and helping the local communities to deal with waste. It operated what was called the Good Friday clean-up of the whole county, providing a service free of charge to collect bags collected by local voluntary groups along the roads and in the towns and villages. I could not stand over the service providers being tarred with the same brush because we have a wonderful service and we are proud of it. There are two or three more operators in County Kerry and we are very proud of them and this debacle was certainly not caused by them. I want that to be clearly remembered in this Chamber. The local authority is still providing a service in Killarney town and is doing a wonderful job as well. We cannot criticise the providers because it is not fair or right. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, deciding where to go with the waste will be a real problem because we are being told now that it is not cost efficient to go abroad with it any more, indeed it is not wanted. For a long time it was cheaper to go that way than it is now. We need to open up local places like Muingnaminnane around our country so people will have somewhere to go with it.	spk_358
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-06-14	dail	32	Order of Business	dbsect_3	I refer to job creation in rural Ireland, especially in County Kerry where we are greatly hampered by the lack of road infrastructure into the county, with bottlenecks in Macroom and Adare. Last year the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport announced that the Macroom bypass project had been included in the six-year capital investment programme. For which of the six years is it scheduled? County Kerry is greatly hampered in the creation of jobs and we cannot attract indigenous or foreign investment because of the lack of infrastructure, especially for access. The broadband service is practically non-existent. If one gets off an aeroplane at Farranfore Airport and travels one mile either way on the three roads out of Farranfore, there is no mobile phone coverage.

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-06-01	dail	32	Order of Business	dbsect_5	It is on jobs and rural development, on page 42 of the programme for Government. Large payments of VAT and other taxes due to the principal contractors whom the subcontractors work for are being delayed, in many cases for long periods, by the Revenue Commissioners. The delay is rumoured to be caused by a shortage of staff in the Revenue departments. This is causing a vicious circle whereby the smaller operator at the end of the line is waiting too long for his €2,000 or €3,000 to pay wages to staff or make other payments. Such people cannot survive and are going under. New regulations from June 2015 mean that subcontractors cannot be paid until the principal contractor logs the details with the Revenue Commissioners. How can one log in, in rural Kerry or other rural areas, when one has nothing to log in to? There is no broadband available there.	spk_221

If one was at the HSE forum in the County Hall in Cork and asked the HSE to account for something, it would refer it back to the Department. The buck needs to stop with somebody. I ask the new Minister, who is a fit young man himself, to take charge of the Department of Health to ensure that the service is properly run and overseen. Are there too many officials in the HSE rather than front-line staff? Front-line staff in the hospitals in Kerry, including nurses and those on the floor especially at night, are, and have been, under tremendous pressure. There are clearly not enough nurses. At University Hospital Kerry in Tralee and at Killarney Community Hospital, staff are visibly under pressure every day of the week. If a nurse goes off sick on a ward, which happens, the rest of the staff are under severe pressure for the duration of the shift. We need more nurses and that must be addressed. There is a problem with recruiting GPs in rural areas. I highlight Rathmore in Kerry where it is a real issue now. Graduating GPs are not inclined to stay in our country. They cost a great deal to educate but in one year - 2014 - 89 of the 91 who graduated left the country. Something has to be done to rectify that and, as such, I call on the Minister to ensure it is. Every morning an account is given on radio in Kerry of the number of patients on trolleys. It happens all over the country. Why is that so? Why can we not sort it out? In Kerry, it appears the reason is that so many of our wards are closed. At University Hospital Kerry, two or three wards were closed completely four or five years ago because they could not be staffed. Staffing is the issue. The new community hospital in Kenmare is only half open as is Dingle Community Hospital. The grounds for the hospital in Dingle were given over by the landowner for free to build a community hospital for the people of the area and yet a lot of its accommodation is being used as office space for the HSE. I deplore that because it is not why the hospital was built.  Turning to mental health, a new unit has been built at Deer Lodge on St. Margaret's Road in Killarney. It has been completely finished for almost 12 months but there are no staff available for it. Sadly, close to my home in Kerry, four people have committed suicide. I am not saying the opening of this unit would have prevented that but the unit has been built for a purpose and is not serving one as long as it remains unopened. I ask the new Minister to address that issue immediately because the unit in Killarney is needed by all of the people in Kerry. We had what we were told was a reconfiguration of the ambulance service two or three years ago. ""Reconfiguration"" is a terrible word because I take it to mean a reduction in service rather than a reconfiguration of the service. In Kerry, and I suppose it is the case nationally, the rule is that an emergency hospital ambulance cannot take a patient to a district hospital. We had a case on the Muckross Road in Killarney where a patient could not be taken by the emergency ambulance to the district hospital in Killarney. The man took his last drive in the world in the back of a builder's van when the doctor involved secured a wheelchair to put him into it. We are supposed to have intermediate care vehicles to take care of that situation but in the south, sadly, there are no staff to operate them. I ask that the issue be addressed. There is no point having vehicles if there is no one to drive them. What is happening with home help is a serious issue for me. Home help is vital to keep elderly and disabled people in their homes for the last years of their lives but it has been seriously cut. A great many people are in contact with my office each day to ask about hours or to say that the hours that they already had have been cut. In one case, an elderly woman of 88 years of age was getting five half hours over five mornings but that has been cut to two half hours. The woman was born in 1928 and has given her life to the country.After spending her life rearing her family and doing her best for everyone she met, this is how she is being treated. Her home help has been cut from five half hours - a half hour each morning - to two half hours. A blind man in another part of the constituency has had his home help removed at the weekends. On Saturdays and Sundays, he gets up and tries to put on his clothes but because he cannot see, they are upside-down and inside-out. He burns himself with water whenever he tries to make himself a cup of tea. He lives alone and his neighbours are worried about him. It is not fair, as people do not get better at weekends or on bank holidays. It is sad to think that on Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day and New Year's Day, when all of the world is operating under the guise of peace and good, or on any other bank holiday, there is no home help for some people. This matter must be addressed. Surely doing so would be cheaper and easier than putting people into nursing homes. Some of them die after a few weeks of being in a nursing home. If they could be helped to stay in their own homes, it would mean so much to many and save the country a great deal of money. Kerry has a separate issue and is under more pressure. People are as entitled to live in Kerry as in any other county. A few weeks ago, we had the case of a patient whose address was given as Ballydesmond, Mallow, County Cork. While that is her correct address, she is actually on the Kerry side. If she was on the Mallow side, she would get 20 hours of home help per week but because she is on the Kerry side, she only gets ten hours per week. We are in the same country, so everyone should be treated the same. All of the children of the country should be cherished equally. This matter must be addressed. There are no ifs or buts about it and I will not settle for anything less. People who need home help should get as much of it as possible and it should be distributed equally to everyone."	spk_379
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-05-25	dail	32	Order of Business	dbsect_5	I ask the Taoiseach and the new Minister for Health, in light of the very disturbing article in yesterday's newspapers which highlighted that disabled and elderly persons' applications for home help would be delayed until later in the year, that this issue be dealt with in a proactive fashion, because elderly and disabled people do not have much time on their side. When they need help to get out of bed they need it immediately; it cannot be delayed. The programme for Government provides that a review of the operation and funding of national home help services is to be undertaken. I ask that this be dealt with urgently. Operations and serious medical interventions and procedures are being delayed at Cork University Hospital and Mercy University Hospital in Cork due to a lack of beds. Surgeons are ready and waiting to undertake operations but they do not have beds available for patients after their operations. I ask that these two matters be dealt with urgently.	spk_112

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-05-04	dail	32	Agriculture: Statements	dbsect_3	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on behalf of farmers, in particular those in rural Kerry and Ireland. As a small farmer, I can identify with all their current problems as they strive to continue farming. This week the  Weanlings are now selling below what it costs to keep them. Feeders lost €200 per head last year, and as a result suckler farmers, who are trying to produce weanlings, will be hit with a €200 deficit this year in marts and markets. Like all other areas of farming, suckler farmers are struggling. They are the foundation of the beef industry. I call on the Government to consider the request from farming organisations to give €200 per sucker cow as a premium to sustain farmers until things improve and ensure family farms continue to operate in rural Ireland. Sheep farmers are also in serious trouble. Lamb prices decreased from €10 to €7 this year.The margins are very small and when farmers are hit with such losses they will be in serious trouble all along the hillsides of Kerry where they are up late and early trying to endure and survive and when everything else is surmounted they have to deal with the fox. There were severe losses as a result of the bad weather which we had this year at lambing time. The sheep industry is in serious jeopardy as well. I support the call for a €20 ewe premium to ensure the viability of sheep production in rural Kerry. Dairy farmers are in a serious crisis. I blame the previous Government for not advising farmers properly when the quotas ended. Farmers were advised to increase production. It was said markets were available in China and elsewhere and now we know the Chinese have no notion in the world of drinking milk. The market is not what was predicted and the new farmers that got into the dairy business are in serious trouble. They bought land, built sheds, bought cows and now they are selling the milk for below what it cost to produce it. How long does the Minister think that will last? Those people are in serious trouble. Those farmers were hell bent on working and they knew what was involved but they did not realise a market would not exist for the milk. The monopolies of factories and their stranglehold on prices is unfair. Farmers are not being paid properly for what they produce. We have other problems as well in farming in rural Kerry. All farmers are losing money but the forestry that was blown down in 2013 have not been replanted. It is costing money to clear them and very little money is to be had for the timber that is taken out because it is damaged. Another problem is that there is no grant available for marginal land in rural areas to plant trees and the land is not fit for much else. If a grant were available to plant trees on such land many farmers could provide jobs but approval is not being given. One must have 80% of good agricultural land and 20% of marginal land in order to get a grant, which means that system will not work. I ask the Government-----	spk_122
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-05-04	dail	32	Agriculture: Statements	dbsect_3	I will share it with Deputy Michael Collins. Rivers are blocked up all over the country. Farmers are terrified of clearing rivers and removing gravel or trees. The Government must give assistance because in many instances the OPW is involved in many of the rivers and it is its duty to clear them out. The local authorities say they are not involved but they must get funding from the Government because if a river floods and brings down trees and debris and then damages bridges crossing the public road the Government will have to replace the bridges. I ask the Government, the local authorities and the OPW to work together to ensure rivers are cleaned out. Many houses and roads would be made safer as a result. Foiladaun and Clonkeen in the Glenflesk area are flooded. The N22, the national primary route from Cork to Killarney, is flooded. I call on the Government, and have already called on the Department of Finance, to fund the clearing of the Flesk river. Such matters must be dealt with urgently. We must not allow beef into the European market. If that is to happen the European market will not retain its credibility. Beef cannot be allowed in from foreign countries. All farmers are losing money at present. A few years ago one farmer won the lotto.	spk_124

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-05-04	dail	32	Climate Change: Statements	dbsect_4	I say to Deputy Eamon Ryan that he will have to change, because I do not agree with all the talk of climate change. There have been patterns of climate change going back over the years before there was ever a combustible engine working in this or any other country. If we go back to the 11th and 12th centuries, this country was roasted out of it, and in the 15th and 16th centuries we were drowned out of it. In the 1740s we had a famine in which we lost more than 3 million people because of two years of bad weather. The records will prove that to Deputy Eamon Ryan. At the time of the famine we did not have any combustible engine or anything like it. Deputy Ryan referred to cattle and suckler cows. There was not a fraction of the number of cows in Ireland at that time that there are now. Patterns of climate change took place and mankind had no hand, act or part in it. It was just something that happened. If one goes further back, the country was covered in ice during the Ice Age, and if one then goes forward to the 1860s and 1880s, this country was drowned out of it. In one particular year the sun did not shine at all, and there were not yet any combustible engines in the country. We are being asked to pay a carbon tax that is costing all sectors of the community massive sums of money. It is hurting the young fellow going to work in the morning. It is hurting the fellow with a lorry on the road. It is hurting those with tractors on farms. The question is where the money being collected in carbon tax is going. One place it did not go last Christmas was to pay for home help for the elderly and invalids who were refused home help for Christmas Day, St. Stephen’s Day and New Year’s Day. It did not go to them, anyway, and the question is where is it going. We are collecting so much of it that someone has to answer for it or be accountable for it. The carers who sought it for elderly people did not get it until those whom they were supposed to mind had died. I believe God above is in charge of the weather and that we here cannot do anything about it. The previous Government did not do what it was supposed to do, not to mind attempting to regulate or rectify the weather. One Minister suggested we should put €3.5 million aside to improve weather forecasting, but that will not change the weather. It has been said that climate change is the cause of flooding in the country, but the flooding is due to the fact that rivers have not been cleaned out. The Flesk river in Killarney and Glenflesk was cleaned out 35 years ago and it was grand for about 20 years. Now it is in a desperate state again, but the view is that now climate change is the cause of flooding and we cannot get funding to clean rivers. If we even got a small part of the €3.5 million - around €200,000 - the river would be cleaned and there would be no more talk of flooding in Glenflesk. The River Shannon was not cleaned out since the English last cleaned it out. Perhaps if that river were cleaned there would not be half the flooding or the need for funding to be set aside to deal with flooding. We must deal with the root of the problem. The rivers are silted up. They are blocked with trees and every other kind of obstruction. We must start there and not get carried away with the notion of addressing climate change by hoping to change the weather. That is my view on climate change. We are only a small country in this part of the hemisphere. The other larger countries and continents must play a role. We should play a proportionate part with regard to our size because, listening to what has been said, one would conclude that we are being overcharged and over-regulated in this regard. The big question is where the money that is being collected in carbon tax is being spent, because I do not think it is having any effect in changing the weather.	spk_202
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-04-26	dail	32	Mental Health Services: Statements	dbsect_7	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about this important matter. I deplore the actions of the Minister in charge of mental health services in taking €12 million from the mental health budget. It is regrettable that he did such a thing, even in a caretaker capacity. The Minister travelled to County Kerry before the general election to rename Kerry General Hospital. What did that cost and what was the purpose of it? Was it to get pictures of Fine Gael candidates on the front page of  There is a new purpose-built mental health unit in Killarney, at a cost of €40 million, which is not yet open. It has been standing empty for 12 months. I ask the Minister, in his caretaker capacity, to provide the staff needed to get the place working because it is needed urgently by the people of County Kerry. Suicide is a problem that has affected many families around the country. People's well being is continuously neglected. We must deal with this, as certain patients need much more care. Some need care on a one-to-one basis before they commit an act that affects their families and friends. It is so real and final. I feel for all of the families affected by it. We are dealing with road deaths effectively, but mental health issues are not being addressed properly or fully. There have been cases involving boys who were under pressure starting out in life, for example, in college. We have lost many of them. On our side of the country, there is now a phenomenon of older men doing this. They lived and operated successfully, but sadly they ended their lives. Much of it is down to money pressures. Some were waiting for their farm payments, which were delayed. There should be some recognition of this and an allowance given so that people can get at least part of their money, as they must provide for their families. We need more funding and resources to deal with the pressures of modern life. I call on the incoming Government as well as the caretaker Government, for whatever length of time it operates, to treat this matter as one of the most urgent issues that must be addressed.	spk_106
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-04-20	dail	32	Health Services: Statements	dbsect_6	I thank the Acting Chairman. I have raised many of the issues that I wish to raise with the HSE at its HSE South forum meetings in Cork over the years. We have now reached a crisis point in Kerry. One of the issues is the provision of home help services. A lady, a double amputee, was getting an enhanced home care package with 20 hours of home help in County Cork, where she was moved to stay with one of her daughters on being discharged from hospital, but when she moves back to County Kerry she will get only ten hours of home help. With regard to the reduction in home help hours, there is a serious anomaly between the two counties that needs to be addressed. We have been told it is a staffing issue and that the service does not have the necessary funding to acquire more staff. That needs to be urgently addressed. It is not satisfactory that very sick people who are being cared for at home do not get home help at the weekend, on bank holidays, or on Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day or New Year's Day. That is not good enough. Kenmare Community Hospital and Dingle Community Hospital are operating at half their capacity, as only half of their bed complement is open. There is only one respite bed in Kenmare Community Hospital for the catchment area served by that hospital. Those who care for their elderly relatives at home - often it is a son or daughter who minds an elderly parent at home - should be able to get respite care for those they care for, but only one respite bed is open in Kenmare Community Hospital. It is a new state-of-the-art building but, sadly, it is only operating at half capacity. A new mental health facility built on St. Margaret's Road in Killarney at a cost of €40 million was completed almost a year ago but has not been opened. The provision of mental health services throughout the county is a serious issue. What is the delay in the opening of that grand facility? Independent Deputies were criticised over the weekend for having lists of requests or projects to be completed in their constituencies. I make no apology to the Minister for asking him to staff that facility. Funding was provided to build it, and now that it is has been built, all that is required is that it be staffed. Regardless of whether the Minister is in office only for a few more days or is the incoming Minister, I ask him to address this issue urgently while it is still within his power to so do. There is a serious deficit in catering for the needs of physically and mentally handicapped teenagers in County Kerry. Funding for St. Francis Special School in Beaufort has been seriously cut. Despite the fact that we have highlighted the issue to the Minister and other politicians and made it a national issue over the past two years, the facility has been hit with a lack of funding. There is a serious delay in the provision of orthodontic treatment for young people. I am dealing with the case of a young fellow who will lose some of his teeth if he does not get treatment shortly. The waiting list is such that it could take anything from one year to three years before he is seen. That is not acceptable.  Elderly people who are on the waiting list for cataract operations are in danger of going blind. Some of them have severely impaired vision. Our requests to the HSE to intervene are falling on deaf ears. That is the problem in this country. No one appears to be responsible for what is not being done or for any wrongs that are done. In his role as Minister for Health, the Deputy should be in total charge of what is happening in the health service, but that does not seem to be the way it is. When we ask representatives of the HSE about these issues at HSE South forum meetings, they say they will ask the Department, and when we ask for more funding, they say they have to refer it to the Department. Yet when the Minister is asked about these issues in the Chamber, he seems to say he will refer the question to the HSE. The buck must stop with someone. That is what is wrong in this country. No one seems to be responsible for anything. I am asking the Minister and his successor to ensure that the disadvantaged, sick and elderly people are seen adequately and equally, because that is not happening at present.	spk_160
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-04-20	dail	32	Insurance Costs: Statements	dbsect_7	I do not think I will need ten minutes because much of what I have to say has already been covered. However, the increase in the cost of insurance is considerable. A figure of 30% has been mentioned for young drivers. These are young people trying to go to work. They include apprentices starting out or people starting new jobs on small incomes or wages. They have been getting quotes anywhere as high as €5,000. That is not on. It is enticing these youngsters to stay at home rather than attempt to go out to work.If they have to pay €3,000, €4,000 or €5,000, it is too much for these young fellows and girls who are starting out. This category is hit more and hit harder than all the other categories of drivers. It is unfair that older cars can go through the rigours of passing the national car test, NCT, and be in a legal road state but insurers will not insure them. This means another category of people will not be on the road because they cannot afford a newer or dearer car. There is nothing wrong with the cars they have as they would have an NCT. They are not even being given a quote. Families may have a second car, with a wife or partner at home having a car to bring children to and from school. These people have to drop one car and it is making it very difficult for them to survive in rural areas. I was disappointed with the economist Mr. Dan O'Brien, who wrote an article a few weeks ago for the  People with commercial vehicles, including hauliers, are also seeing effects on their businesses in a big way. There was a reduction in the tax rate last year, which I appreciate, but these people are back at square one because of the increased cost of insurance. From personal knowledge I know that when somebody makes a claim against a person and the insurance companies should fight it, the companies often do not want to do it. We will not name the companies but they seem to pay the person making the claim. They do not fight the claim, even when the insured person feels he or she is right. They just pay out the claim and charge the insured party more. The practice must be regulated and something must be done, as it is very unfair. An insured party may feel that the blame should at least be assigned 50-50, or even that he or she was more in the right. The insurance companies do not fight such issues and prefer just to pay out, meaning it is left to the people paying their insurance costs. It is one of the reasons costs are increasing. There are also bogus claims, which should be tackled in a more efficient way. Many claims are being made and every Member has heard about them. Something must be done, as it is one of the reasons insurance costs are rising. Insurance awards seem to be excessive. As Deputy Donnelly mentioned, it just does not seem right that all these claims are going through. People have whiplash and there is no real vetting of what is happening at all. People seem to be claiming and getting away with it but they could be back playing football or hurling, swimming or whatever again, with nothing wrong with their necks, a few days after getting the award. There is also the issue of flooding and what this entails for people in their homes. If they make a claim because of flooding, their insurance costs go up, and if there is a second claim, they will not get insurance again. It is a very serious issue. It is happening and one of the reasons we have so much flooding is because our rivers are not being cleaned. There has been no attempt in the world to clear rivers in Kerry. I do not know what is happening in the rest of the country and every other fellow will have to speak for himself and represent his people. The rivers I know in Kerry are totally clogged, which is a reason places like Clonkeen, Foiladown, Glenflesk and Curreal are flooded continuously. Houses are ruined and people finish up with no insurance. There is a new phenomenon with a crowd called the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, doing a study around the south of Ireland. I know a number of people in one area, Glenflesk, who have been told their houses and property may be flooded some time in the next 50 years. The insurance companies know that now and they have the maps. Accordingly, these people are being charged excessively for insurance on their homes. That is not fair as the properties have never been flooded. Some genius has come up with the divine knowledge that the houses will be flooded some time in the next 50 years, but in the meantime people will have to pay an exorbitant cost for insurance. The houses may never be flooded. These issues must be addressed as people in homes need insurance. It is not fair for any insurance company not to quote them. The reasons for not providing a quote or insurance are unfair, which is not on. I feel very strongly for these people. If it was said to somebody in a car crash that when the money was paid out, he or she could not get insurance any more, we would not accept it. People's homes are their castles and they are entitled to insurance for their families and properties. The rules of insurance companies must be sorted out. If we do nothing at all in here, we should highlight such matters. People are suffering and it is a big worry. Many of us would be very worried if we went to bed and thought there was no insurance to cover the house.	spk_178

A lot of time has elapsed and there are many serious issues that I wish to raise in this Chamber. I wish to hold the Minister for Health and Ministers for all sectors to account. I know a man in east Kerry who is totally blind. His home help has been cut down to five days. He does not have home help on bank holidays or Christmas Day. He is putting his clothes on inside out and upside down. He is spilling hot water on himself. We need to get that issue addressed because if people need home help for five days they need it for seven days. If old people are confined to wheelchairs and need help to get out of bed they will not be well enough at the weekend to go dancing or to go to rambling houses or whatever. They do need attention.	spk_130

Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-03-22	dail	32	Housing and Homelessness: Statements	dbsect_8	There is a building crisis. All of us who have been elected to the Thirty-second Dáil must work together to see what we can do for those who need housing. To put matters in perspective, I note that birds have nests for their chicks, foxes have dens for their cubs and rabbits have burrows for their young and so forth. Families - parents - need warm, safe homes for their children. Whether it is to provide social housing or help people who are trying to build houses for themselves, we must do our best to ensure that happens. A number of factors are militating against house building. Builders cannot access funding from banks. They will not provide it, even though they are owned, by and large, by the State.If builders get funding from other financial houses, interest of 12% is demanded of them. They cannot work like that. They tell me that their margins would be as low as 2%. To build a house in Kerry, the average cost is approximately €220,000. This means that a builder would only get €4,000 or €5,000 after taking all of the risk. He or she would have to pay tax out of that. It would not work. I know of a young man who wants to borrow €100,000 to build a house on his farm but the bank will only give him €180,000. He can do much of the work himself and fix the house up enough to have a kitchen, bathroom and bedroom as a start for himself and his wife. That is all he wants to do but if the bank keeps insisting that he must borrow €180,000, he does not have the income to ensure that he gets the mortgage. Issues such as this need to be addressed. Many middle-income earners cannot get mortgages. If they do, they must pay €80,000 of the €220,000 in taxes, including VAT. This amount must be paid for throughout their mortgages, be they for 20, 25 or 30 years. There is also approximately €15,000 in development levies. Working together, the Government and local authorities must do something to address these issues. The Minister needs to be more accurate in his language than when he announced €62.5 million for housing in the likes of Kerry in 2014. In 2013, €1.3 million was supposed to be made available for housing. After inquiring to see what had gone wrong, we found out that, although an announcement had been made, there were four stages of approval to go through before any house could be built. In Kerry, three local authority houses have been built in the past eight years. As to the four stages of approval, a design must first be sent to the Department for its agreement, which takes three or four months. The next stage involves design changes, which take three or four more months. The council's costings are then sent but the Department might not agree with them. One can never determine the cost until a project is put out to tender. People ask us where the €62.5 million has gone but it was never there. We have been held up in red tape because the Department insists on unreasonable requirements. Some of the schemes, for example, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and long-term leasing, are not working because the caps are too low. In Killarney town where houses are like gold dust, rent has increased to €900 but the cap is somewhere around €600. People fear that they will be out on their ears because rents are increasing. This is a fact. We need to address the caps. If the Minister does not, many more people will become homeless in Kerry. I thank the Ceann Comhairle, as I know that my time is up.	spk_211
Danny HealyRae	63	Unknown	Kerry	#DannyHealyRae	2016-03-10	dail	32	Nomination of Taoiseach	dbsect_10	I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his election by the Thirty-Second Dáil. This day four weeks ago I had no idea or ever dreamt that I would be addressing Dáil Éireann as a Member of the Thirty-second Dáil. However, the people of Kerry sent me up here, alongside my brother, Michael. Many people went to a lot of trouble to ensure we got up here. They are looking at us today and wondering what is going on. In the same way as the parties proposed their leaders for Taoiseach, I could have proposed my brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, for Taoiseach but I would never try to make a laugh of the country. That is what is going on here today. I am sorry to say I will be voting against the four nominees proposed here because they are not providing a permutation that will work as a Government this evening. More talking needs to be done, and more should have been done in the past two weeks since the election. The people of Ireland played their part. They voted for every Deputy here. They are relying on all of us to come together and form a Government. There is talk that we may have to have another election. What difference will that make? Will the people of Ireland change their minds in a few weeks? I do not think so. I do not know what happened in the Civil War; it was long before my time but there is a lot of talk about it. The bigger parties must get together and offer us a Government and give over what I call posturing because time is slipping by. Imagine if a referee was in Croke Park on the third Sunday in September and Kerry and Dublin were on the field and the referee had no ball. That is what we are like here today. We have nothing substantial to vote for from any side. I will be voting against the people proposed today.  There is talk about four weeks. That is too long. Two weeks is too long. The parties will have to get together and give us a proper permutation that will provide a stable Government for the country. The people voted; they have spoken. It is up to the parties to forget about the past. The future is what we want. We are living for today. They have the ball in their hands. They should not drop it. They will have to get around the table and work together because the people are asking for that. When I go down to Kerry tonight, they will be very disappointed that there is no Government. The whole of Ireland is looking at us today. There are many people from Kerry outside the building today. It is sad to think we are going down without a Government after all this. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said this morning, what if this number of people turned up for a wedding and the bride and groom never turned up? It is much the same here. The parties do not have their figures right. They have not added them up together. No permutation or leader proposed offers us a real chance to provide a stable Government for the future. I ask them to work better at it now.	spk_90
