He previously served as Chair of theCommittee on European Union Affairsfrom 2016 to 2020.[1]Prior to entering national politics, he was involved in local politics inCounty Kerryand pursued business interests.[2]Family life[edit]He is the youngest son ofJackie Healy-Rae, who was a TD for Kerry South from 1997 to 2011; and the brother ofDanny Healy-Rae, who is also a TD. His mother, Julie Healy, was born inWilmington, Delaware, U.S., but grew up inNew York City,New York.[3]He has 5 children, two of whom were found guilty and convicted of assault charges in 2019.[4]His son, Jackie Healy-Rae Jnr, was elected as a councillor forCastleislandLEA at the2019 Kerry County Council election.[5]Local politics[edit]Healy-Rae is a former member ofKerry County Council, and was first elected to the Council at the1999 local elections, representing theKillorglinlocal electoral area.[6]He retained his seat with an increased vote at the2004 local elections.[6][7]Reality television[edit]In autumn 2007, Michael Healy-Rae took part in a reality television show onRT\u00c9calledCelebrities Go Wild, set in the \"unforgiving landscapes\" ofConnemara,County Galway. He emerged as the winner, having received the largest number of votes from the \"viewing public\". In June 2011, news broke of a voting scandal, for which journalistSenan Molonyreceived the award for \"Scoop of the Year\" at the National Newspapers of Ireland's Journalism Awards.[8][9]It was revealed that Healy-Rae had received 3,636 votes from a phone inLeinster House, at a cost of \u20ac2,600 to the Irish taxpayer, thepremium-ratecalls being charged a tariff designed to raise money for charity.[10]Only limited information was available as to how the calls were made. Speculation that an automated dialler had been employed was discounted by theIrish Independent, which suggested they were made over 31 hours using \"redial\".[11]TheCeann ComhairleSe\u00e1n Barrett, described it as \"an outrageous abuse of facilities\", while theTaoiseachEnda Kennysaid the money spent on the calls should be paid back.[12]On 29 June 2011, Healy-Rae said that while he was not involved in the calls, he would pay the money back.[12]In October 2017, Healy-Rae appeared onLivin' with Lucy.[13]National politics[edit]Healy-Rae was elected for theKerry Southconstituency at the2011 general election, when his father Jackie retired from national politics. He, like fellow IndependentsMichael LowryandNoel Grealish, were not members of theTechnical groupin the31st D\u00e1il. He missed two-thirds of votes in his first D\u00e1il term, despite being signed in for his expenses on each day a vote was taken.[14]Healy-Rae was appointed to the board of the Citizens' Information Board in April 2009. He was asked twice to resign his position from the board because of a conflict of interest between his subsequent membership of the D\u00e1il and his membership of a body advising theMinister for Social Protection. After he refused to resign, the Minister dismissed him in July 2011.[15][16]On 9 December 2011, having earlier participated in a debate on social welfare, he took ill at Leinster House and was advised to leave the D\u00e1il chamber. Health ministerJames Reilly, a medical doctor, tended to him outside the chamber, he was brought from Leinster House on a stretcher, placed in an ambulance and rushed toSt. James's Hospital.[17][18]His political platform includes opposition to tighter controls on drinking and driving.[19]His father and brother have also expressed similar views on such legislation.[20]In January 2012, Healy-Rae proposed changingIreland'snumber platesystem so that thesupposedly unlucky number13 would be dropped for the year 2013 to save the Irish car industry.[21][22]Healy-Rae has raisedThe Humin D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann after witnessing it himself while meeting some of his constituents who were \"nearly gone out of their minds\" with it. The official response he received, was described by Healy-Rae as \"away with the fairies gobbledygook.\"[23]He topped the poll inKerryat the2016 general election; his brotherDannywas elected alongside him. This was the first time that two siblings from the same constituency were elected to the D\u00e1il.[24]A short while later, on the evening of 20 March 2016, Michael Healy-Rae experienced being unintentionally \"tossed around by a cow\" who was after calving in a shed at his farm nearKilgarvan. He was taken to hospital with his injuries.[25]At thegeneral election in February 2020, he topped the poll again, and was re-elected on the first count.[26][27]Property Development[edit]In February 2018, Michael Healy-Rae listed 11 properties for letting or rental and two either being renovated or awaiting planning permission in the register of TDs' interests.[28]In March 2020, it was reported that he had added three properties to his portfolio in the 2019 Register of TD's interests, bringing the number of properties to 21.[29]The three new properties include a house inClonkeenfor which purchase was going through contract stage, a house inTraleeat the same stage and a property in Kilgarvan that is in the process of being renovated.[29]In May 2020, he was refused planning permission to convert the ground floor of Nancy Myles Pub in the Ballymullen area of Tralee.[30]The plan was for four apartments and had met with strong local opposition.[30]The council's decision was appealed by a number of locals and a conservation organisation.[30]The majority of the decision to refuse was based on the grounds that the proposal would not allow the residents enough natural light or amenity standards.[30]It was the second time the appeals board has overturned a decision by Kerry County Council to grant him a change of use for the pub.[30]In February 2021 the Register of Members Interests was published, covering 2020, revealing that he remained the largest landlord in the D\u00e1il, with 5 plots of land, 16 properties.[31]A quarter of TDs are landlords or property investors.[31]Other interests[edit]He has also listed in the register of TDs interests that he is apostmaster,farmer,plant hirebusiness operator andshop owner.[28]His plant-hire business has worked for theHealth Service Executiveand he has a contract for providing fuel to Kerry County Council.[28]In May 2020, a complaint was lodged with the clerk of the D\u00e1il over his failure to declare his interest in The Skellig Hotel Experience, a company that ran the Skellig Star Hotel inCahersiveen.[32]He had a 25% share in the company after investing \u20ac25,000 in January 2019, but there was no entry for his shareholding on the Oireachtas Register of Interests.[32]Oireachtas members are required to declare any shareholding over \u20ac13,000.[32]When controversy over the leasing of the hotel Michael Healy-Rae said that he was not involved in the leasing of the hotel, but he later accepted the Skellig Hotel Experience held the lease.[32]The company was sold in December 2019 to Paul Collins who runsdirect provisioncentres.[32]Michael Healy-Rae was adamant that he had no knowledge that it would be converted into a direct provision centre.[32]Other[edit]In December 2019, he was transferred to hospital after a fire at his shop.[33]In May 2020, he called for theLeaving Certificateexams in 2020 to be cancelled due toCOVID-19, in contrast to his brother Danny who said that the exams should go ahead in 2020 with proper social distancing, possibly using public buildings such as community centres and libraries.[34]Publications[edit]Time to Talk: Stories from the Heart of Ireland, Gill, Ireland 2018.A Listening Ear: More Stories from the Heart of Ireland, Gill, Ireland 2019.References[edit]^\"Michael Healy-Rae\".Oireachtas Members Database.Archivedfrom the original on 7 November 2018.

The patriarch wasJackie Healy-Rae(1931\u20132014).History[edit]Michael Healy-Rae is nicknamed \"Dolly\" for mimicking the attributes of his fatherJackie Healy-Rae grew up on a small farm, returned after emigrating to the United States,[1]and developed building-supply and retail businesses. He was a member ofKerry County Councilin theKillarneylocal electoral area(LEA) from 1973 until 2003, as aFianna F\u00e1ilmember until the1997 general election; the party did not select him as a candidate inKerry Southso he ran as anindependentand unexpectedly won a seat in the28th D\u00e1il. At the1999 local electionshis sonMichaeljoined Jackie on the council, representingKillorglinLEA. When thedual mandatewas abolished in 2003, Jackie vacated his council seat and another son,Danny,  was co-opted in his place. At the2011 general election, Jackie retired and Michael was elected to the D\u00e1il, with his council seat filled by Danny's son Johnny.[2]At the2014 Kerry County Council election, Danny retained his Killarney seat while Johnny won in the new South and West Kerry LEA.[3]Just before nominations closed for the2016 general election, in the enlargedKerry constituency, Danny joined Michael as a candidate. They ran a united campaign with strictvote managementand both were elected.[4]Danny's daughter Maura was co-opted onto the council as his replacement.[5]Michael's parliamentary assistant (PA) is his son Jackie junior;[6]Danny's PA is his wife Eileen,[7]while his secretarial assistant position isjob-sharedbetween his daughter Elaine and Johnny's wife Caroline O'Mahony.[citation needed]At the2019 Kerry County Council election, Maura and Johnny stood for re-election in the Killarney andKenmareLEAs respectively, while Jackie junior stood inCastleislandLEA.[8]All three were elected.[9]The two TDs and three councillors appear together onThe Late Late Showon 31 May 2019.[10]Jackie junior remains Danny's PA while serving as councillor.[11]On 25 November 2019, Jackie and his younger brother Kevin were convicted ofassault causing harmat a chip van in Kenmare on 28 December 2017;[11]they receivedsuspendedjail sentences of eight and seven months respectively.[12]Policies and image[edit]The Healy-Raes areclientelist: Jackie gaveconfidence and supplysupport to Fianna-F\u00e1il-led governments of1997\u20132002and2007\u201311in return forpork barrelfunding for South Kerry. Opponents characterise them asgombeens,[13]and news media have criticised them aspopulistand lacking anyideology, while supporters portray them as standing up to the metropolitan elites in Dublin.[14]Jackie (throughout his D\u00e1il career) and Michael (in the31st D\u00e1il) chose not to join thetechnical groupto which independent TDs are entitled. The Healy-Raes' main rivals for votes in Kerry are Fianna F\u00e1il candidates.[15]Outside the D\u00e1il chamber, Jackie was always seen wearing a trademarkflat capin public; though Danny appears bare-headed, Michael has carried on the tradition,[4]and in February 2017 was permitted to wear it in the D\u00e1il chamber.[16]Michael was nicknamed \"Dolly\", afterthe cloned sheep, for being similar to his father;[17][18]journalist Shane Hegarty enumerated \"[t]he flat cap, the mannerisms, the political ambition, the linguistic trickery, theneck\".[19]AFine Gaelelection strategy document leaked in 2015 described Michael as 'someone who hides behind \"the veneer of a friendly/simple countryyokel\" but who is \"unbeatable electorally\"'.[20]After the 2016 election, Michael and Danny aligned themselves with other rural independents during separate negotiations with Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il.[21]Michael publicly proposed creation of a Minister for Rural Affairs, while playing down media suggestions he himself might take the position.[22]When the32nd D\u00e1ilchanged D\u00e1ilstanding ordersto allow multiple technical groups, Michael and Danny joined the Rural Alliance technical group.[23]In 2008, theIrish Timeslikened the Healy Raes to the mafia, calling the family \u201cthe well honed Healy Rae political mafia,\u201d with formerCeann Comhairleand Kerry TDJohn O\u2019Donoghueclaiming that there was \"a tinge of theCosa Nostra'' in one of Jackie Healy-Rae's requests in relation to election boundaries.[24]In a 2011 edition ofIrish Political Studies, an example of assistance from one of the family members was cited by one voter as a reason for supporting them; \"I need a track machine to clear a drain and Johnny had it down to me with a driver in two days, all free.\"[25][26]Ahead of the 2020 general election, British newspaperThe Guardiancommented that \"the family has elevated patronage and personal connection \u2013 venerable traditions in Irish politics \u2013 to high art.\" On the electoral success of Jackie, it wrote that he \"distilled the Kerry-man archetype \u2013 flat cap, melodic accent, folksy phraseology \u2013 into a potent formula.\"[27]See also[edit]Families in the OireachtasReferences[edit]^O'Regan, Michael (28 September 2015).\"Julie Healy-Rae dies in Killarney\".The Irish Times.

Photograph: Bryan O\u2019BrienHarry McGeeFri Feb  9 2024 - 12:55The bog road from Kilgarvan rises steeply northwards until it reaches the lower slopes of Mangerton, the big brooding mountain that dominates this corner of south Kerry. There are some green fields here but for the most part the land is unforgiving.One of the townlands in the shadow of Mangerton is called Reacaisleach, or Rae, for short. From this impossibly remote corner of Kerry has come one of the most idiosyncratic and durable political dynasties in Irish politics.This weekend the Healy-Raes celebrate 50 years of public life with a high-profile bash in Kerry: a \u201cdance\u201d in the ballroom of the Gleneagle Hotel in Killarney attended by various generations of the family. The second generation currently has two TDs in the D\u00e1il and, at local level, three councillors drawn from the third generation.Harry McGee reports from the Gleneagle Hotel, Killarney where the Healy-Rae family celebrated 5O years in politics by putting on a dance for their supporters. Video: Bryan O'BrienThe Healy-Rae brand is associated with a thick Kerry accent, a flat-capped Darby O\u2019Gill caricature, a reputation for endless work and a form of politics that is rooted in populist and unashamed clientelism.READ MORE\u2018You\u2019d be out of your mind to go there\u2019: How witnesses really feel about Oireachtas committeesBernie Sanders: \u2018We are taking on very powerful people who will fight us tooth and nail\u2019South Carolina state of mind: Once an overwhelmingly Democratic state, now resolutely redJackie Healy-Rae, its patriarch, was born in 1931 \u2013 the Rae part of the surname refers to the townland \u2013 into great poverty. When he was eight, his father had an accident that confined him to a wheelchair. It was left to Jackie and his mother to provide for his five younger siblings.\u201cTheir main source of living was cutting turf and selling it,\u201d said his eldest son Danny. \u201cMy grandmother could cut it as good as any man and he was certainly as good as any fellow in any bog from the age of eight.\u201dThat endless appetite for hard work has become something of a family trait. Jackie, despite his lack of education, had other talents. He was a strong hurler and a musician of note who played with local bands on the accordion; he also learned how to play the saxophone. He had an entrepreneurial streak; he started a plant hire business and bought a pub. He was keen to be involved in his community.Jackie Healy-Rae leaving Leinster House with his son Michael in January 2011. Photo: Eric Luke / THE IRISH TIMESHe also knew how to attract attention and get noticed. For one, his mellifluous idiom often drifted straight from the 19th century. And from the time his hair receded in the 1960s, he never appeared in public without a signature hat: first a Russian-style Ushanka fur hat and then a tartan flat cap.\u201cHe was known for being a colourful larger-than-life figure, and that certainly didn\u2019t do him any harm in politics,\u201d says the Kerry-based historian, Owen O\u2019Shea.\u201cHistorically, Jackie might have been dismissed because of the accent \u2013 and we Kerry people are proud of our accent \u2013 but behind it all, he was articulating, in his own way, the various problems and issues of concern to people he represented.\u201dHealy-Rae emerged as an influential background figure in the Fianna F\u00e1il organisation in the 1960s. There was a byelection in South Kerry in 1966. Niall Blaney was Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s election guru at the time. He was impressed by Healy-Rae.\u201cJackie\u2019s strategy was based around making a fuss, rallying the troops, organising people on the ground,\u201d says O\u2019Shea.\u201cHe had a reputation for using razzmatazz: the marching bands, the motorcades, the parades with men carrying pitchforks with blazing sods of turf. The theatre marked him out.\u201dJackie Healy-Rae and his supporters arrive in Dublin from Kerry after winning a seat. Photograph: Alan BetsonWhen Blaney left Fianna F\u00e1il, Healy-Rae became the go-to expert in the party for byelections. Danny remembers travelling to Galway, Cork and Mayo with him in the 1970s where he directed campaigns. He was also director of elections in Kerry for three decades.His sons,MichaelandDanny, were steeped in politics from childhood.\u201cI was in it with him every step of the way,\u201d says Danny. \u201cWe\u2019d milk the cows in the morning and he\u2019d be off to meetings. There was one phone in the house and fellows would be ringing from quare places and I had all of them off by heart. Nothing was strange to me . . . I was in the cumann, and a delegate to the Comhairle Ceantair, and stuck in all of it.\u201dJackie\u2019s first break came when he was co-opted on to Kerry County Council in December 1973. Despite his best efforts, it took a quarter of a century for him to get his first shot at national politics.When John O\u2019Leary retired in 1997, Healy-Rae, then 66, believed he should be his successor in South Kerry. Fianna F\u00e1il chose O\u2019Leary\u2019s son, Brian, instead. Jackie pushed the nuclear button and ran as an Independent and won a seat against the odds.Former Irish Times parliamentary correspondent Michael O\u2019Regan, a Kerry native, has closely observed the Healy-Raes since the 1960s.\u201cOne thing about them was they were incredibly good at PR. Margaret Thatcher had Saatchi & Saatchi. The Healy-Raes had the Healy-Raes,\u201d he says.\u201cThey are quite capable of playing to the caricature. Jackie did it all the time. It always generated interest.\u201dDr Theresa Reidy, a lecturer in politics at UCC, says Jackie was astute in his dealings with taoiseach Bertie Ahern in the D\u00e1il following the 1997 general election but is critical of the kind of \u201cpork barrel\u201d deal struck between the Fianna F\u00e1il government and Independents that favoured one constituency over another.[Miriam Lord writes in 2019: Healy-Raes show the true meaning of party politics]\u201cWhat was interesting was that Jackie was very strategic in extracting benefits for his constituency in return for conditional support for the government. He used to famously be out of the traps before John O\u2019Donoghue [the Fianna F\u00e1il minister from South Kerry] telling the local people what he had got.\u201dDanny met The Irish Times in his pub in Kilgarvan this week. It\u2019s a spotless old-fashioned country pub, a picture-perfect John B Keane set, complete with a blazing fire. Around the walls are dozens of photographs and posters recording the political and personal lives of the Healy-Raes. Outside, the village itself is well covered with the Healy-Rae name and images.It\u2019s clear that Danny and Michael are different but both are unmistakable chips off the old block. Take their organisational skills and discipline. Michael was the first to be elected in 2011.Family business: Michael Healy-Rae\u2019s son Jackie preparing for his father\u2019s election campaign in February. Photograph: Don MacMonagleWhen Danny was elected five years later the brothers ran the campaign like a military operation, mapping the whole of Kerry into separate Danny and Michael territories. It all came straight from Jackie\u2019s playbook.Reidy says their ability to retain their seats and expand the dynasty has been no surprise.\u201cTheir visibility is not an accident. They are two of the most hard-working politicians and have a good sense of what matters to their constituency. I also think they\u2019re able to map national issues back to their constituency in terms of what\u2019s relevant and matters,\u201d she says.The family have other businesses and are sometimes criticised for not putting clear blue water between them and politics. The evidence points to not inconsiderable wealth within the family but they live modest lifestyles, without ostentation.The family\u2019s reputation for modesty was dented by Jackie Healy-Rae jnr, an Independent councillor on Kerry County Council and his younger brother Kevin, sons of TD Michael Healy-Rae, being given suspended sentences for a late-night assault at a chip van in Kenmare on December 28th, 2017. The assault stemmed from Kevin jumping the queue for chips and shouting: \u201cThis is my town.\u201dReidy notes that, politically, the Healy-Raes are masters of ambiguity. She gives the example of them siding with rural communities over the controversy about migrant accommodation, while Michael, from a business side, has been involved in providing accommodation to migrants.The public flyer issued marking the Healy-Rae family's 50 years in politics in Killarney, Co Kerry on Friday, February 9th.Beyond everything else, however, politics is the family business and that means both TD brothers, Michael and Danny, try to leave no phone call unanswered.\u201cIsn\u2019t it great that one family has been doing it for 50 years?\u201d says Danny. \u201cI get no better satisfaction in life than being able to help out a fellow to get a few bob, or get approval for a road, or to get a hospital appointment.\u201cI believe in answering the phone any hour of the day and night, and I get calls late at night for different things. Someone on a trolley in Tralee maybe for 12 or 14 hours, that\u2019s 86 years of age, and some family member would ring.\u201cThat\u2019s the appreciation that we get from the people for being available.\u201dThe remains of former Kerry South TD Jackie Healy-Rae are carried through Kilgarvan village following his funeral mass at Patrick\u2019s Church, Kilgarvan, Co Kerry in December 2014.

Maura, a secondary schoolteacher in Bandon, drives up to South Kerry almost every night to canvass, to go to meetings, or to hold clinics. Her accent is softer than her father\u2019s but it\u2019s clear that the approach of this generation will not vary.\u201cThe most important thing is being available,\u201d she says, echoing Danny.\u201cThe most frequent thing people will say is at least the Healy-Raes will get back to you anyway.\u201dDoes this generation have a different world view to their parents and grandfather? No, says Maura.\u201cFor the most part, we would share the same thoughts. The issues that I\u2019m dealing with in Kerry County Council: roads, housing, health \u2013 we agree on all those things. You know, we\u2019re dealing with the same people most of the time.\u201dSociety is changing. Voters\u2019 engagement with politics is changing. But for now, none of that looks like it will have any impact on this singular dynasty.\u201cThey got one in every three votes in Kerry in the last election,\u201d says local historian O\u2019Shea. \u201cYou cannot deny their enduring success.\u201dSign up forpush alertsand have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phoneFindThe Irish Times on WhatsAppand stay up to dateOur In The News podcast is now published daily \u2013 Find the latest episodehereKerryMichael Healy RaeDanny Healy RaeIN THIS SECTION\u2018You\u2019d be out of your mind to go there\u2019: How witnesses really feel about Oireachtas committeesBernie Sanders: \u2018We are taking on very powerful people who will fight us tooth and nail\u2019South Carolina state of mind: Once an overwhelmingly Democratic state, now resolutely redOne in five TDs are landlords as Michael Healy-Rae boosts property portfolio to 25Miriam Lord: Minister would have thrown Si\u00fan under a bus, but RT\u00c9's heavy vehicles are all clapped out from overuseMOST READMorris O\u2019Shea Salazar: How Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa drugs cartel developed a Kerry connectionRT\u00c9 board members \u2018furious, insulted and fed up\u2019 over forced resignation of chairMan jailed for two months as a \u2018deterrent\u2019 after he arrived at Dublin Airport without a passportIs it any wonder that Ireland\u2019s public transport is among the worst in Europe?\u2018You\u2019d be out of your mind to go there\u2019: How witnesses really feel about Oireachtas committeesLATEST STORIESZelenskiy welcomes western leaders in Kyiv as Ukraine marks second anniversary of Russian invasionIreland v Wales: Live updates from Six Nations clash in DublinDeath toll from Valencia apartment block fire rises to 10Winning start for AntoineDupont in Sevens as France record double victoriesPadraig Harrington moves up the leaderboard in Mexico; Leona Maguire falls back in ThailandDozens reportedly killed in Gaza overnight as Brazil\u2019s president accuses Israel of genocideWho is Yulia Navalnaya?Man arrested as part of investigation into use of drones to smuggle drugs into prison\u00a9 2024 The Irish Times DAC\u00a9 2024 The Irish Times DACSubscribeWhy Subscribe?Subscription BundlesSubscriber RewardsSubscription Help Centre(Opens in new window)Home Delivery(Opens in new window)Gift SubscriptionsSupportContact UsHelp Centre(Opens in new window)My AccountAbout UsAdvertiseContact UsThe Irish Times TrustCareersIrish Times Products & ServicesePaperCrosswords & puzzlesNewspaper ArchiveNewslettersArticle Index(Opens in new window)Discount Codes(Opens in new window)Download the appMyHome.ie(Opens in new window)\u2022Top 1000\u2022The Gloss(Opens in new window)\u2022Recruit Ireland(Opens in new window)\u2022Irish Times Training(Opens in new window)Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie InformationCookie SettingsCommunity StandardsCopyright\nMichael Healy-Rae TD (@m_healyraetd) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos\nPlease wait...\nWe spent two days with the Healy-Raes in Kerry: Here's what happenedXSign inMy AccountSign out\uf015\uf2bd\uf107Sign inSubscribeMy AccountSign outsubscriber\uf107news\uf107IrelandMunsterCorkWorldCourt & CrimePoliticsClimate & SustainabilityHistorySpotlightLongreadsObituariesNews -

11:00Ciara Phelan,  Senior Correspondent\uf09a\uf232\uf142\uf0e1\uf281\uf0e0This article was first published on January 6, 2024.Standing in the family pub once owned by their father, Michael and Danny Healy-Rae speak almost in their own language about a local man who seems to be causing trouble.The fire roars as the turf burns, heating the small lounge area where net curtains cover the windows and where the two Healy-Rae brothers sit, the setting could have been mistaken for the night the pub first opened in 1969.The Mick Clifford Podcast: Ciara Phelan on the Healy-RaesThe two brothers understand what one another is saying despite broken sentences in a bid to avoid giving away details about a constituent as a photographer snaps pictures of their fireside chat.\u201cHe was an absolutely outstanding man,\u201d Danny says about his father while pointing out pictures of former TD Jackie Healy-Rae on the walls in the pub in Kilgarvan, Co Kerry.The Healy-Rae Bar in the centre of Kilgarvan, Co Kerry. Picture: Dan LinehanFramed pictures include Jackie peeling spuds, attending a social gathering in 1996 in the Gleneagle Hotel with Bertie Aherne, and with his beloved all-white albino horse Peig which was once stolen but later found after an appeal in the D\u00e1il.Jackie Healy-Rae when he offered a \u20ac1,000 reward for information on his albino pony 'Peig' which was stolen from his farm in Killarney. Picture: Don MacMonagleLike a shrine to their father, election posters dating as far back as local elections in 1985 are plastered on the walls in a separate area of the pub where a pool table stands.A \u2018cash only\u2019 sign hangs behind the counter among bottles of stout, red wine and memorabilia in the bar where both Michael and Danny meet every Sunday night to watch a repeat of The Week in Politics, but no alcohol is consumed. Danny, despite being a publican has never touched a drink, while Michael decided to cut out alcohol eight years ago explaining he couldn\u2019t continue to enjoy a drink while having to drive long hours on the roads across the kingdom.Danny hasn\u2019t far to travel, with his home house attached to the pub, while Michael is less than a 10-minute walk away from his modern home.Both brothers dismiss speculation that they don\u2019t have a close relationship once they disappear from the D\u00e1il chamber.\u201cWell we don\u2019t get into bed with each other or anything like that. We\u2019re as close as we can possibly be,\u201d Danny says.\u201cThere\u2019d be a lot of things we don\u2019t have to ask each other 'what\u2019s your view on this or that?' and there might be a few differences along the way and we\u2019re not tied at the hip,\u201d he adds.In an interview days previous in Dublin, Michael said: \u201cWe\u2019re not like two auld fellas sitting in the corner, smoking fags and drinking pints and shooting the breeze. We don\u2019t have time for that. To answer your question, when do we sit down and talk? It\u2019s actually always the same time: between 10pm and midnight on a Sunday night.\"Danny Healy-Rae and Michael Healy-Rae at the Healy-Rae Bar in Kilgarvan, Co Kerry. There are differences between them, one being Danny voted against the extension of the eviction ban whereas Michael wanted the Government to keep it in place. Picture: Dan LinehanBut there are differences both personal and political. One being, as Danny points out, he voted against the extension of the eviction ban whereas Michael wanted the Government to keep it in place, despite being one of the biggest landlords in the D\u00e1il. They have the same view on fundamental issues such as abortion, Michael notes.Personally, Michael is agitated when challenged about his views on immigration and his business dealings while Danny seeks to calmly explain his position on such topics.According to his son, Cllr Johnny Healy-Rae, Danny is \u201cwhat you see is what you get.\"\u201cHe was a very unlikely politician. He\u2019d hardly keep a mobile phone alongside him and if you were looking for him you wouldn\u2019t find him. Time-keeping would have been bad but now he\u2019s meticulous at what he does and is completely consumed and obsessed by politics,\u201d he added.Cllr Johnny Healy-Rae at the quarry business he runs near Kilgarvan, Co Kerry. Picture: Dan LinehanThe eldest of Danny\u2019s six children, he said of the close relationship with his father and his sister Maura, also a Kerry councillor, that the family is \u201cwell able to express\u201d themselves but they rarely row.Michael\u2019s son Jackie Healy-Rae junior is also a Kerry councillor and even though he, along with Johnny and Maura all occupy seats in different electoral districts, locals in Kilgarvan and Kenmare say there has often been rumours of political rivalry between the clans.Jackie junior, who was first elected to the council in 2019, dismisses this speculation and says he gets annoyed that all Healy-Raes \u201care painted with the same brush\u201d if one member of the political family has a certain view.Cllr Jackie Healy-Rae said he gets annoyed that all Healy-Raes \u201care painted with the same brush\u201d if one member of the political family has a certain view. Picture: Dan Linehan\u201cWe don\u2019t always agree on everything,\u201d he adds, stating there are five involved in politics but are all independent thinkers.The 28-year-old, like his cousins, is hoping to retain his seat in the upcoming local election this summer. Joking, Jackie junior says his hair differentiates him from his father before admitting he needs to work on appearing more empathetic.\u201cOne weakness I have is I\u2019m a bit too direct, too blunt whereas Dad would be a bit more empathetic. It's not that I don\u2019t have empathy, he would just be able to break it more gently.\u201dIn the D\u00e1il, both Healy-Rae brothers have faced criticism when they have accused Government and some Opposition TDs of not understanding working people. Labour TD Duncan Smith said the pair \u201cput on a political costume and caricature\u201d and drive their Mercedes into their plant hire businesses.He said he would not be lectured by the Kerry TDs about understanding workers when they are the sons of millions of euro and Fianna F\u00e1il privilege \u2014 referring to former TD Jackie Healy-Rae\u2019s historical links to the party. It's difficult to argue with Mr Smith's point of view.Responding to the charge, Danny says anything that either he or Michael have, they worked hard for and any money they have, they earned it and they don\u2019t deny that.Cllr Johnny Healy-Rae says his family is \u201cwell able to express\u201d themselves but they rarely row. Picture: Dan LinehanHe credits the success of his plant hire firm to his sons Johnny and Dan who run the company on a daily basis. He has seen his business boom with his own plant hire company enjoying a record year in 2022 to return profits of \u20ac1.12m.He says that despite what it says on paper, the money is not in his pocket and denied he was a millionaire. Days after our interview in his pub in Kerry, Danny picked up the phone to make it clear once again that he wasn\u2019t flushed with cash.\u201cI don\u2019t call myself anything other than middle class or working class because I\u2019ve worked all my life,\u201d he said.He also said it was \u201cthe gospel truth\u201d that the pub does not generate a profit and it has had fewer customers in recent years.He did disclose despite their political bond, he never discusses business with his brother. Both have separate plant hire companies and despite Michael owning in the region of 20 properties according to D\u00e1il records, Danny is coy about his landlord brother.\u201cMichael is [a landlord] I hear. That\u2019s one thing we don\u2019t talk about is business because he has a few machines as well so we don\u2019t discuss business but we do discuss politics,\u201d he adds.Despite renting out a significant amount of property, owning a service station, a post office, and a plant hire firm, Michael also denies he\u2019s a millionaire and one of the country\u2019s wealthiest TDs.Between Kilgarvan and Kenmare, it proved difficult to meet many people who had a negative word to say about the Healy-Raes, particularly among the older generation.Jackie Healy-Rae. \u201cHe was an absolutely outstanding man,\u201d his son Danny said. Picture: Don MacMonagleHowever, speaking to some young adults who wanted to remain anonymous, they questioned Michael\u2019s stance on immigration while also being in receipt of a State contract worth over half a million euro from the government to house Ukrainians at one of his guesthouses in the county.Those interviewed believed the brothers have worked hard for the county and if they needed something done, it would only take a phone call. That was evident given that an hour-long sit-down interview with Danny was interrupted 19 times due to his phone ringing.It\u2019s something that will likely keep the Healy-Raes elected until they eventually decide to step aside and allow their children to continue the dynasty.Q&A with Michael Healy-RaeThere was a charge made against you previously by Labour TD Duncan Smith questioning how you could be the voice for working-class people when you\u2019re a millionaire and have many businesses. Explain how you actually see yourself as the voice of the working class when their lives are not your reality.That\u2019s a nonsensical statement for him to be making and for you to be repeating, right, because it\u2019s not factually true.But you do have a number of businesses\u2026Yeah but sure so what? I\u2019ve small businesses that are struggling.You\u2019re one of the wealthiest TDs in the D\u00e1il though?No, that\u2019s rubbish. That\u2019s absolute rubbish. I\u2019ve a shop that employs 17 people and that shop was really, really struggling the last number of years. It has lost money, right, because it\u2019s a convenience shop, it\u2019s a petrol station like, that\u2019s struggling to pay its bills, to pay wages, and keep the door open.Michael Healy-Rae standing in the petrol station forecourt in his home village of Kilgarvan, Co Kerry. Picture: Dan LinehanAnd like anybody that knows anything about small business, they\u2019ll know that business is struggling. I\u2019ve plant hire [business] if I wasn\u2019t sitting here in a suit, I\u2019d be up on a digger driving a machine. Again, a very tough and competitive business to be at.But you increased your profits last year.That actually wouldn\u2019t be factually correct.It was reported\u2026No but sure do I take any notice of what a report says? I know what way business is going and I can tell you that business is struggling and then so that\u2019s that.What's your view on this issue?You can tell us hereThen with regard to property, sure of course I own property because I was at it since I was 19. And when I did the first house I was 19 and I borrowed every penny of it and I actually couldn\u2019t even get the money from the bank. It was builders\u2019 providers that backed me and gave me the stuff that I needed to do a job.How many properties do you have?I\u2019d have a good share of properties.You know how many you have though.That\u2019s the answer I\u2019m giving you, I\u2019d have a good share of property, right? But like I owe an awful lot of money to banks. I\u2019ve an awful lot of obligations to run a thing like that. It takes a lot of money and it\u2019s just like any business.Michael Healy-Rae in his office at Kilgarvan, Co Kerry. Picture: Dan LinehanWhen you\u2019re a politician and when you\u2019re farming, at contracting, when you\u2019ve property and a small business like a petrol station, any of the people that come to you with problems, sure any problem they come to me with, aren\u2019t you after having it yourself already?Have you though? You\u2019ve never been on the breadline or sleeping rough.Well, tell me what politician has.So you dismiss you\u2019re one of the wealthiest TDs?Absolutely.And when you say to me that your businesses are struggling, how so?The shop I\u2019ve been at for 33 years, 1991 I started, I\u2019ve never seen trading as difficult as it is now because the basic costs are so expensive. Operating a business is very difficult and you\u2019ve to keep modernising and improving and you can\u2019t do that because you don\u2019t have the money so you\u2019ve to borrow the money from the bank.So you\u2019ve borrowed substantial money from the banks?Oh God, course I do, continuously. I\u2019m continuously in debt. I\u2019ve never in life been out of debt.How much are we talking?God damn you. I\u2019m a politician. I don\u2019t have to go telling you. How much do you owe?I owe nothing. And you?Well, all I can tell you is I owe a lot of money and I continuously owe a lot of money.Does it not keep you up at night?No, it doesn\u2019t because sure we\u2019re going to die anyway, what difference does it make?Who\u2019s going to pay it then when you die?Oh sure I don\u2019t know.If you didn\u2019t win your seat again, what else would you do to pay off this debt?I\u2019d be up on a digger the following day.Speaking of money, you\u2019ve spoken of needing a cap on the number of Ukrainians and refugees coming into Ireland. But do you think it\u2019s credible to be calling for that, considering the money you get from the Government to house Ukrainians?Why is there something wrong with housing Ukrainians? I house students, student accommodation, I house young couples who get HAP or RAS. I house workers, people who don\u2019t claim any benefit whatsoever, they just rent property and they work. I house everyone else, was I going to discriminate against a person because they\u2019re from Ukraine? I won\u2019t take you but I will take Mrs Murphy and her son? Like that\u2019s an awful thing. So are you asking me to be a racist so?I didn\u2019t ask you that.And the other thing then, doesn\u2019t it show I\u2019m very credible in that, on one hand, I\u2019m able to provide accommodation and then at the same time say \u2018hold on now, we can\u2019t have an open-door policy here that this can go on forever\u2019 because of my intimate knowledge of the housing situation in Ireland that I know this can\u2019t go on forever.Michael Healy-Rae: \"I owe an awful lot of money to banks. I\u2019ve an awful lot of obligations to run a thing like that. It takes a lot of money and it\u2019s just like any business.\" Picture: Dan LinehanI don\u2019t house international protection people because I just don\u2019t have room for them. It never came into the equation because of what I said at the time when the Government was saying house Ukrainians, have you property? And I did. It\u2019s a number of families that I have. But is someone suggesting that there\u2019s something wrong with that?The only people that have questioned me about it are people in the media and politicians shouting about it.Danny Healy-Rae interviewDespite being criticised for comments he has made on immigration, Danny Healy-Rae is at pains to insist he is not\u00a0racist.Speaking from his pub in Kilgarvan, Co Kerry, Mr Healy-Rae says he has worked for \u201call communities\u201d, including the Bangladeshi people in Killarney, and dismisses accusations he uses inflammatory language when discussing the State\u2019s immigration policy.He says: \u201cI do appreciate all the people from whatever part of the world but there is a thing going on at the present time, our own people feel like they\u2019re not getting the same level of service as some of these masses of people that are coming in now and that needs to be addressed.\u201cWell I don\u2019t call it inflammatory and if the government had listened all along about a debate on the issue of a cap, that\u2019s all we\u2019re talking about and we\u2019re not being racist,\u201d he adds.The politician says he wants the same \u201cperks\u201d given to landlords who offer accommodation to everyone, not just Ukrainians. Currently, the Government gives a household a \u20ac800 monthly payment if they offer a room to a Ukrainian.\"I want the same thing for our own people,\" he says.(Left to right) Danny Healy-Rae and Maura Healy-Rae during the first meeting of the 33rd D\u00e1il. Photo: Gareth Chaney/Collins\"I can see what\u2019s going to happen. Our own people are going to be looking to get into hotels or centres because there won\u2019t be any houses.\"He said the public is aware that other EU countries are not offering shelter to over 100,000 refugees and will not be fooled.The brothers have often faced criticism for their politics. In April 2023, Mr Healy-Rae, responding to criticism from West Cork TD Christopher O'Sullivan on electric vehicles, claimed the Fianna F\u00e1il TD \"must think [he is] a complete fool.\"When put to him by theIrish Examinerwhether he accepts that he is a fool, Mr Healy-Rae says: \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t get as much education or go to a university that they would have gone to and maybe that\u2019s why they say it.\u201cI know I\u2019m not a fool and no one will take me for a fool either... maybe they\u2019d like to throw that at me but I don\u2019t mind, once the people of Kerry keep electing me and I keep listening to what they want and try to do as best as I can for what they want and I\u2019m happy then.\"Climate ChangeMr Healy-Rae claims \u201cour little country and the people running it are gone mad,\u201d when it comes to climate change.Despite the recent flooding which saw businesses and homes destroyed across the country, he says climate change has been happening all of the time. In 2016, Mr Healy-Rae made headlines when he claimed that \"God above is in charge of the weather\" and that people could do noting about it.He says he has \u201cno problem\u201d with the State moving to reducing emissions but the government has to be realistic. He says while attending a funeral in recent weeks in America he was struck by the size of the vehicles on the roads. He adds when he reads and sees what\u2019s happening in countries like China which has ramped up its coal power, Ireland is \u201cat nothing\u201d when it comes to cutting its emissions.\u201cIf I saw that they [US and China] were doing something, it would give some credence to it. But we have been over the top. Every new regulation is put on the backs of the Irish people,\u201d he says.When asked whether he worries about the potential impact of climate change on his grandchildren\u2019s lives in the future, he says: \u201cDon\u2019t anyone dare say to me that I haven\u2019t consideration for my grandchildren as Eamon Ryan or anyone else because I have.\u201dHe also points to the importation of peat and coal briquettes to Ireland, saying it makes no sense when the country is seeking to reduce its carbon footprint and emissions.\"The poor cow is to blame for everything\u201d, he argues, when discussing the reduction of emissions in the agriculture sector.Jackie Healy-Rae with his sons Danny and Michael.
