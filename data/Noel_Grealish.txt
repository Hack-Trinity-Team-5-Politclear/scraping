He was formerly aProgressive DemocratsTD.[2]Grealish first contested an election in 1999, when he was elected toGalway County Councilto represent theOranmorelocal electoral area, with 1,357 first preferences. He was first elected toD\u00e1il \u00c9ireannat the2002 general election, with 2,735 first preferences, succeeding long-serving TDBobby Molloy.[1]He was re-elected at the2007 general election, with 5,806 first preferences.[3]As one of only two Progressive Democrat TDs elected in 2007, he was appointed as Chairman of the Progressive Democrats Parliamentary Party in June 2007. He was Deputy Leader of the Progressive Democrats from 25 May 2007 to 24 March 2009, succeedingLiz O'Donnellin the position. Towards the end of 2007, Grealish stated that he had discussions with a seniorFianna F\u00e1ilpolitician about the possibility of him joining Fianna F\u00e1il,[4]but made the decision to stay with the Progressive Democrats.[5]He assumed the leadership of the Progressive Democrats on 24 March 2009, following the decision of then-leaderCiar\u00e1n Cannonto stand aside and joinFine Gael. Grealish served as interim and final leader of the party until 20 November 2009, at which point the party disbanded.[2]He sits as an IndependentTDinD\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, and was re-elected as an Independent deputy at the2011,2016and2020general elections. He supported theFianna F\u00e1il-Green Partygovernment in parliamentary votes from 2007 until 24 September 2010, when he announced that he was withdrawing his support for the government due to health cuts.[6][7]Anti-immigrant rhetoric[edit]In September 2019, Grealish faced criticism and calls to resign after he made comments about asylum seekers, described by some commentators as racist, which described all African asylum seekers as \"spongers.\" TheTaoiseachLeo Varadkar, after being told during an interview what Grealish had said, remarked \"If that\u2019s what he said, he should withdraw those remarks and make a statement on it and clarify them\".[8][9][10][11]Fellow Independent TDMichael Collinsdefended Grealish in a radio interview, in which he claimed Ireland was \"losing its culture\" because of immigrants and suggested that Ireland should \"look after our own people first and then when that issue is sorted, let's start looking at people from across the world\". For this, both he and Grealish were criticised in Irish political circles, with Labour leaderBrendan Howlincalling the pair \"highly dangerous\",[12][13]while Irish PresidentMichael D. Higgins, while not directly referencing them, publicly rejected their rhetoric, suggesting it was not factual that Immigrants were replacing people in Ireland, and that Immigrants accounted for a high percentage of Ireland's GDP.[14]Grealish courted further criticism on 12 November 2019, when he claimed in the D\u00e1il that immigrants in Ireland were sending vast sums of money out of the country, and singled outNigerianresidents in Ireland, claiming they were sending \u20ac3.5 billion in funds back to relatives in Nigeria. Grealish went on to suggest this amount could have been generated by crime.Ruth Coppingerrose to her feet and called Grealish's remarks \"Disgraceful racism\".[15]Responding to his question, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar called on Grealish to present \"any evidence\" that the funds were generated by crime, while also citing the long history of Irish emigrants sending money back to Ireland. TheCentral Statistics Officeof Ireland debunked his reading of the statistics on 13 November 2019, correcting him by stating the amount being sent back was only \u20ac17 million. Furthermore, Finance MinisterPaschal Donohoecalled on Grealish to clarify why he focused specifically on Nigerians and to justify his presentation of his figures. Housing MinisterEoghan Murphysaid he did not like what Grealish was insinuating and referred to his rhetoric as \"disgusting and potentially dangerous\".[16][17]Oireachtas Golf Society scandal[edit]In August 2020, Grealish became one of the figures of theOireachtas Golf Society scandal, when members of the Oireachtas Golf Society were accused of breaching the rules set down by the Irish government about gathering during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Grealish served as Captain of Oireachtas Golf Society and the event took place under his leadership, with the invitation to the event bearing his personal signature and the signature of President of the SocietyDonie Cassidy.[18][19]Following the details of the event becoming known to the public, Galway City Mayor Mike Cubbard and Galway County Council Chairperson James Charity called on Grealish to resign as a TD.[20]In February 2021 theDirector of Public Prosecutionsannounced Grealish would be criminally prosecuted for his role in Golfgate.[21]In May Grealish was issued a summons for a court date of 22 July.[22]The case was adjourned until 28 October.[23]On 3 February 2022, Grealish, Cassidy, and their co-defendants were acquitted of all charges. The Court concluded: \u201cThey were all responsible people who would not have gone to a dinner unless they felt comfortable and unless the organisers had not put in place all that was required to make it safe.\" Grealish said he was \"delighted with the outcome\".[24]References[edit]^ab\"Noel Grealish\".Oireachtas Members Database.

Video: Oireachtas TVPat LeahyThu Nov 14 2019 - 01:30Two months ago Noel Grealish was recorded at a public meeting in Oughterard, called to discuss the potential opening of new accommodation for asylum seekers in the Co Galway town.\"These are people that are coming over here from Africa to . . . to sponge off the system here in Ireland, \" he told the meeting.When Grealish\u2019s comments came to light a media storm ensued with a heavy emphasis in many places on the obvious racist overtones. Grealish himself went to ground, refusing to give further comment. Didn\u2019t apologise, didn\u2019t explain. He was heavily criticised in the D\u00e1il chamber (where he is not a regular attendee) and in the media.A dog whistle is heard only by the dogs. This wasn't a dog whistle. It was a foghornWhen contacted, however, many of his constituency colleagues and other public figures in Galway were reticent about condemning his views. The Oughterard story ran for several days. Everyone noticed. And people in Galway West noticed.READ MOREFact Check: What do the figures on money sent to Nigeria from Ireland reveal?Grealish urged to apologise for \u2018exaggerated\u2019 remittance figuresPaschal Donohoe told he \u2018needs to get hands dirty\u2019 in dealings with insurance industryMiche\u00e1l Martin goes canvassing with Senator in hot water over derogatory commentsConclusionGrealish is a canny and experienced politician. He has held the seat, once occupied by Bobby Molloy, a co-founder of the Progressive Democrats, since 2002, first for the PDs and afterwards when the party was destroyed, as an independent.If Grealish was ambushed by the recording of his remarks about Oughterard, he will have carefully evaluated the local reaction to them. And his comments in the D\u00e1il on Tuesday \u2013 when he asked the Taoiseach about the \"astronomical\" sums of money being sent from Ireland to Nigeria \u2013 were prepared and scripted. He knew exactly what he was doing.The comments were criticised in some quarters as a racist dog whistle. But a dog whistle is heard only by the dogs. This wasn\u2019t a dog whistle. It was a foghorn.The most reasonable conclusion is that Grealish believes he is speaking to and for a section of his electorate that will appreciate these views.TDs in all parties say they notice that anti-immigrant views, previously insignificant if not unknown, are now much more likely to be aired. No party tolerates such views and any TD who expressed them would be in hot water with the leadership. But independent TDs have no such concerns.Last year, the independent presidential candidate Peter Casey turbo-charged his floundering campaign against Michael D Higgins by criticising special provision for Travellers and questioning the recent recognition of their separate ethnic status. The ensuing controversy helped to catapult him into second place in the election, and he ended up with almost a quarter of the vote.The big vote for Casey led to all sorts of fears about the Trumpification of Irish politics \u2013 a flawed analysis which was entertainingly shared by Casey himself, who followed the strong showing in the election by pledging to join Fianna F\u00e1il and become Taoiseach. (He is not, you will have noticed, exactly a fixture on the political landscape 12 months later).But what the Casey vote did demonstrate is that there is a route to political advancement through attacking unpopular minorities using the stained but potent playbook of populism.Old tweetsThat is not the same thing as saying there is a huge political appetite for hostility to immigrants or Travellers. But there is clearly some appetite for it, and some politicians \u2013 primarily independents, free of party discipline, less concerned with what the media say \u2013 feel unconstrained in feeding that appetite for their own political gain. That is now a fact about our politics which is unlikely to be wished away.This is bad news for the other politician in the spotlight this week. Old tweets by Fianna F\u00e1il senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee, the party\u2019s candidate in the upcoming Dublin Fingal byelection, using language offensive to Travellers and others, have landed her in hot water as the campaign begins.Nobody thinks Clifford-Lee\u2019s sins are on a par with Grealish\u2019s outburst, but at a time when there is clearly a public appetite \u2013 limited but real \u2013 for picking on minorities, those who hold contrary values will feel more of an obligation to defend them.For now Fianna F\u00e1il is both furious with, and rallying around, her. But the candidate is only a few more tweets away from being in serious trouble. Grealish, meanwhile, is again keeping his head down.Fianna F\u00e1ilGalway WestBobby MolloyLorraine Clifford LeeMichael D HigginsNoel GrealishPeter CaseyMiriam Lord: Rare outing from the lesser-spotted Grealish captures D\u00e1il attentionMinister queries Noel Grealish\u2019s focus on money sent to NigeriaMost TDs receive death threats, RT\u00c9 survey showsCommittee calls for moratorium on targeted social media political adsSports celebrities \u2018strutting around with impunity despite sex assault allegations\u2019, D\u00e1il toldMary McAleese: Brexit has produced an \u2018enraged, not engaged society\u2019IN THIS SECTION\u2018You\u2019d be out of your mind to go there\u2019: How witnesses really feel about Oireachtas committeesBernie Sanders: \u2018We are taking on very powerful people who will fight us tooth and nail\u2019South Carolina state of mind: Once an overwhelmingly Democratic state, now resolutely redOne in five TDs are landlords as Michael Healy-Rae boosts property portfolio to 25Miriam Lord: Minister would have thrown Si\u00fan under a bus, but RT\u00c9's heavy vehicles are all clapped out from overuseMOST READMorris O\u2019Shea Salazar: How Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa drugs cartel developed a Kerry connectionRT\u00c9 board members \u2018furious, insulted and fed up\u2019 over forced resignation of chairMan jailed for two months as a \u2018deterrent\u2019 after he arrived at Dublin Airport without a passportIs it any wonder that Ireland\u2019s public transport is among the worst in Europe?\u2018You\u2019d be out of your mind to go there\u2019: How witnesses really feel about Oireachtas committeesLATEST STORIESZelenskiy welcomes western leaders in Kyiv as Ukraine marks second anniversary of Russian invasionIreland v Wales: Live updates from Six Nations clash in DublinDeath toll from Valencia apartment block fire rises to 10Winning start for AntoineDupont in Sevens as France record double victoriesPadraig Harrington moves up the leaderboard in Mexico; Leona Maguire falls back in ThailandInside PoliticsOur politics team\u2019s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

He tells eolas about the party\u2019s time in power and shares his views on why people have lost confidence in the political system.How and why did you become involved in politics?I got involved through my dad who was a staunch Fianna F\u00e1iler, who dragged me screaming to my first Fianna F\u00e1il meeting at 15 years of age. He was President of the local cumann, and from that I got involved. I developed a very good friendship with Bobby Molloy. I was there on the night Bobby left Fianna F\u00e1il to join the Progressive Democrats in February 1986, in Leisureland, Galway. I joined too.I won\u2019t tell you what my dad said when I went home, but a shoe was thrown at me and a few expletives used about me.At the time the country was crying out for something they could grab on to, to give them hope or confidence. I felt that Dessie O\u2019Malley, Mary Harney and Bobby Molloy were a great combination to try and come up with solutions. That\u2019s part of the reason that I joined the Progressive Democrats, the other being the relationship I had with Bobby Molloy.I ran in the 1999 local elections in the Oranmore electoral area and was elected. Then in 2002, I was leaving the house on a Friday morning and David Hanley on Morning Ireland came on the radio at five minutes to eight and said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a note here from Minister Molloy, who\u2019s resigned as a junior Minister and will not be contesting the next general election.\u201d I knew the phone call would come.Bobby rang at about 11 o\u2019clock and said: \u201cYou\u2019re running.\u201d I think I got one of the lowest first preference votes in the country that time and I still got elected because I got transfers from all over.What do you think is the Progressive Democrats\u2019 legacy on Irish society and public life?The Progressive Democrats were formed in a climate that we\u2019re actually in now, where the people felt that they were being burdened too much. The party believed low taxes generated more employment. If you look at the stamp duty rate at the time, I think it was 40 per cent and brought in about \u20ac70 million a year. They cut it to 20 per cent; it brought in something like \u20ac600-700 million in the first year. It got people spending. People can argue that that\u2019s what caused the building crisis which we have now because it got people selling and buying houses, but the Progressive Democrats at the time worked on job creation.We were an economic party, I believed. We lost our sense of direction when we went into the two toughest departments: justice and health.The Progressive Democrats did the groundwork to get multi-nationals into Ireland, created the current climate for them, and brought in the low taxation that gave them the opportunity to create thousands of jobs.What\u2019s unique about Galway West?Galway is the gateway to the west; it\u2019s a beautiful county. It\u2019s a tribal, young, attractive city. You\u2019ve 20,000 students coming to Galway every year. It has a university which is a huge asset to our city. The university does a lot of joint ventures with the multi-nationals. It has the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, and has a huge area to draw upon for workers, from Donegal down to Kerry.You\u2019ve also the beauty of Connemara. I love it there: the scenery, the people, just the peace and quiet, that when you get out there you can just pull up and read a paper and eat a sandwich. On a rainy, frosty, snowy or sunny day, it\u2019s beautiful.Does Irish political culture need to change and if so, how?We have a government with such a large majority that it causes its own problems. If Jack Lynch was alive he\u2019d tell you that. In 1977, he came in with the largest majority Fianna F\u00e1il ever had yet he was gone in a couple of years. It is depressing at times coming into the D\u00e1il to see what\u2019s happening at leaders\u2019 questions and what\u2019s been said. I don\u2019t think the D\u00e1il is used to its potential.If there was a lot more co-operation between all political parties, if some mechanism or system could be set up to try and get us out of this, the people would have a lot more confidence in the political system. They\u2019ve lost all confidence in it.Fine Gael, I felt, made an awful lot of promises coming up to the last general election that they did not need to make. If they\u2019d made one promise, that they\u2019d work to get back our financial sovereignty, the people would have backed them on that and would have voted in the hundreds of thousands that did vote for them. All that they promised is coming back now, biting at their heels.What do you hope to achieve for your constituency and your country during the31st D\u00e1il?I\u2019d like to continue on working for the most deprived and most vulnerable in our society. We come across terribly sad cases of families or individuals under stress or struggling, families with disabled children that might be finding it very tough to survive. I\u2019d like to continue to work with them.I work with government ministers, with whom I\u2019ve a good working relationship, to try and bring whatever industry I can to Galway and on any issues regarding schools, hospitals, for the betterment of my constituency.Nationally, one thing I\u2019d like to achieve is to work on an all-party committee if one was set up on budgetary issues, to try and find savings or cost-cutting measures that wouldn\u2019t affect the most vulnerable.How do you like to relax?I find it very hard to relax. What I like is the odd game of golf and I\u2019ve been skiing, for 15 years now, I think. It\u2019s the one trip I absolutely love. I always go either in early January or February. Same place, same hotel, same resort: in Kitzsb\u00fchel, Austria. When I get on the plane to come home,I look forward to going out again the next year. That keeps me going for the year.TagsPolitical PlatformOctober 2012Show MoreShareFacebookXLinkedInWhatsAppShare via EmailCheck AlsoClosePublic AffairsEuropean elections 2024: What to expectFebruary 2024AnalysisGovernment misses waiting list reduction targetAnalysis,IssuesHousing 2022 reflections  Overall housing target on track but crisis aboundsAnalysis,IssuesGalway City: The beating heart of the westAnalysis,Regional focus: Galway City CouncilThe cost-of-living budgetAnalysis,IssuesCategoriesCategoriesSelect Category100 years of policing reportAgribusiness magazineAgriculture Food and DrinkAnalysisBanking & FinanceBrexitBusinessClimate COP26 reportConnectivity and future of workConnectivity reportCover StoryCybersecurity reportData protection reportDelivering cost rental housing reportDigitalDigital government reportDigital government reportEconomyEducationEnergy & EnvironmentEnergyEnvironmentRetrofiteolasEurope and BrexitFeaturedFintech ReportFuture of policing reportFuture of rail reportFuture of work and connectivity reportHealth and care servicesHousingInfrastructureRoad safetyInfrastructure and construction reportIssuesJusticeLocal GovernmentLocal government reportMol an \u00f3igePeoplePoliticsPublic AffairsReformRegional focus: Galway City CouncilRegional focus: Leitrim County CouncilReportsArtificial intelligence reportInfrastructure and construction reportRetrofitting reportRound table discussion: Cyber-resilience in an age of ransomwareRound table discussion: Digital transformation of public servicesRound table discussion: Driving electric vehicle adoption in IrelandRound table discussion: Evolution or revolution?

He is from Carnmore, near Galway. He was formerly a Progressive Democrats member.In the D\u00e1il recently, you brought up the need for a ring road in Galway city and the prices of living. Are you confident that there will be change for the better?Yes, in the D\u00e1il recently, I brought up the issue regarding the ring road. The traffic congestion within Galway city is chronic every morning and evening; people sometimes spend up to an hour and a half or two hours trying to get to work. Hence, there is a need for a ring road to be built, but the project has been deferred back to An Bord Plean\u00e1la, so we will have to wait and see what decision will be made by An Bord Plean\u00e1la. The Taoiseach did assure me recently that if the project gets the go-ahead, then the project will be built, and the funding will be there. The cost of living has increased drastically due to inflation and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine are the biggest exporters of wheat and corn in the world, so it had a knock-on effect on the cost of living.What is the role of a TD?A TD is a national legislator. Our primary role is to bring legislation through the D\u00e1il in various bills and finance. For example, the finance bill is going through the D\u00e1il soon. The budget which we had just before Christmas, so the role of a TD is more or less a national legislator to implement and bring in new laws that affect practically everyone in the country. But, we also do a lot of work in the constituency as well with people coming with issues and concerns. We work with them on the likes of medical cards, social welfare payments and the fair deal scheme. The role of a TD is a seven-day-a-week job. Still, it\u2019s a great honour and privilege to be elected as a TD for Galway West on five or six occasions.Do you feel the role of TD has changed much since you\u2019ve been elected?Not really, but I have noticed in the last while is that it\u2019s harder and harder to get people to make a decision. It is difficult to contact people in a lot of government departments and a lot of the local authorities. I know a lot of that has to do with Covid with people working from home, so I\u2019m hoping that role will change and that we will be able to make contact and have meetings again.Did you always have an interest in politics growing up?Yes, I had always an interest in politics. My father was heavily involved in Fianna F\u00e1il, and at sixteen years of age, I was delegate for \u00d3gra Fianna F\u00e1il. I used to attend the meetings in Richardson\u2019s bar in Galway city.Where did you go to school and college?I went to Carnmore national school, and I then went to secondary school in St Mary\u2019s College, Galway. I then did a week\u2019s course in Harvard University called Approaches for Optimizing Opportunities, which was a great experience. But I really enjoyed my time in school and college.1999 was the first time you contested an election. How did it make you feel when you were elected to Galway County Council to represent the local electoral area of Oranmore?Going back to that time, I left Fianna F\u00e1il in 1987. I joined the Progressive Democrats, and coming up to the 1999 local elections, Bobby Molly, the former Minister and TD for Galway West, contacted me and asked would I run. Hence, I got elected, and it was a great honour and privilege to see so many people give me their actual number one vote. A vote is a very precious thing. A lot of countries around the world don\u2019t have one. Hence, it\u2019s great that people put their trust in me in 1999 and every election since then.You have achieved a lot so far. Is there anything that you are particularly proud of?Well, there\u2019s a few projects that I worked on. One of them there was the installation of traffic lights at Carnmore crossroads. I also got a sewage scheme set up for Claregalway and the new Garda station in Oranmore. I secured funding for Col\u00e1iste na Coiribe in Galway. I was in Carna recently and assisted them in acquiring a million euro of a grant, so there\u2019s lots of things I\u2019m proud of, but there\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019m disappointed with that I didn\u2019t get over the line, but I\u2019m still working on them.On the 24th of September 2010, you announced that you were withdrawing your support for the government due to health cuts. Do you feel it has got any better since 2010?No, the waiting lists has got longer. Too much is cramped into University Hospital Galway, and it is such a small hospital. There are twelve minor injuries units around the country and none in Galway. It is one of my big campaigns to get a minor injuries unit built in Galway. It would take a lot of pressure off the U.H.G staff. We also need a new elective hospital in Merlin Park. We also require more home help as the population is increasing and people are living longer, but there is always going to be pressure on the health services.You have been a good supporter of Galway GAA over the years. How do you think 2023 will go for our footballers and hurlers?I was at the Galway versus Roscommon game, and I wasn\u2019t too impressed with Galway at that game, but then they went on to beat Tyrone and Monaghan, so we have to be optimistic. Hopefully, they\u2019ll do it. I think the hurlers are going to have a challenge. We have some great games coming to Pearse Stadium in the championship. I think the hurlers might struggle, but the footballers might do all right.What law changes would you like to see in 2023?Well, I\u2019m doing a big campaign in the D\u00e1il to get the bail laws changed for people charged with serious crime. When people are charged, they are let back out again, and that needs to stop. A serious criminal should not be allowed out again to re-offend when they are out on bail, so that\u2019s one of the things I want to see change. Also, a person that keeps offending and getting free legal aid that also has to stop. Those are the two big laws I would like to see changed.Dylan McLoughlin+ postsDylan McLoughlinhttps://sin.ie/author/dylan-mcloughlin/Fight or Flight ReviewDylan
