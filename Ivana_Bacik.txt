Bacik previously served asLeader of the Labour Party in the Seanadfrom 2011 to 2021, and aSenatorfor theDublin Universityconstituency from 2007 to 2021.[2]She previously served asDeputy leader of Seanad \u00c9ireannfrom 2011 to 2016.Bacik is known in particular for herabortion rightscampaigning since the 1980s, and her high media profile.[3]Personal life[edit]Bacik's paternal grandfather,Charles Bacik, was a Czech factory owner who moved to Ireland in 1946.[1][4]He eventually settled inWaterfordand in 1947 was involved in the establishment ofWaterford Crystal.[1]Her mother's side of the family are Murphys fromCounty Clare. Her father was an astronomer and was employed in a number of locations. As a result, she lived in London and South Africa, before moving toCrookstown, County Cork, twenty miles west ofCork City, aged six, when he became a physics lecturer in theCork Institute of Technology. She attended the nearby national school inCloughduv. When Bacik was 11 years old, her family moved to the Sunday's Well area of Cork City.[5][6]At the age of 14, she moved to Dublin.[7]She won a scholarship to board atAlexandra CollegeinMilltown, Dublin.[8][5]She lives with husband Alan Saul and their two daughters inPortobello, Dublin.[9][10][11]University politics[edit]Bacik resigned as president ofTrinity College Dublin Students' Unionin 1990, after breaking the mandate from the Union membership regarding voting for candidates at aUnion of Students in Irelandconference.[12]Despite 13 TCD representatives being mandated to vote for one candidate, Martin Whelan, a former TCD SU president, it transpired that he received only 12 votes, Bacik's vote instead being given to the feminist former UCD SU officer, Karen Quinlivan. A controversy erupted in the Students' Union and a subsequent internal investigation led to Bacik's resignation.[13]She was taken to court by theanti-abortiongroup, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (SPUC), for providing information on abortion. SPUC were successful in the court case, although that success came in the 1990s, long after Bacik had graduated from Trinity College.[14]A High Court injunction had been ordered against Bacik and other members of the TCD Students' Union in October 1989.[15]In November 1989, Bacik was informed by the Garda\u00ed that the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) and the TCD Students' Union were under investigation following complaints that \"they were corrupting the public morals by disseminating information on abortion.\"[16]In an article she wrote for the International Planned Parenthood Federation, she said it was soon-to-be Irish President Mary Robinson that prevented her and students' union members from going to prison.[17]Political career and campaigns[edit]Bacik contested theSeanad \u00c9ireannelections in 1997 and 2002 as anIndependent candidatein theDublin Universityconstituency but was not successful in these outings.She ran as aLabour Partycandidate at the2004 electionto theEuropean Parliamentin theDublin constituency.[18]She ran with sittingMEPProinsias De Rossa, who was also the party president, on the same ticket.[19]She polled 40,707 first preference votes (9.6%) but was not elected.In 2004, her bookKicking and Screaming: Dragging Ireland into the 21st Century, was published by O\u2019Brien Press.[20]In 2007, she contested theSeanad \u00c9ireannelections for the third time in the Dublin University constituency, and was elected to the third seat, behind sitting Independent senatorsShane RossandDavid Norris. She initially sat as an Independent senator.In February 2009, Bacik was included in an 'All Star Women's Cabinet' in theIrish Independent.[21]In March 2009, Bacik confirmed claims made on a TV programme that she had taken two voluntary pay cuts of 10% in addition to a pension levy.[22]In June 2009, Bacik was the Labour Party candidate for theDublin Central by-electionshe came in third with 17% of the first preference votes.[23][24]She joined the Labour Party group in the Seanad in September 2009,[25]and became Labour Party Seanad spokesperson for both Justice and Arts, Sports and Tourism. In November 2009, a feature by Mary Kenny of theIrish Independentincluded Bacik in a list of women who \"well deserved their iconic status.\"[26]Bacik campaigning withMichael D. Higginsduring hissuccessful 2011 presidential bidIn May 2010, she sought Labour's nomination to contest the next election in theDublin South-Eastconstituency but was not selected.[27]In December 2010, she was added to the ticket as the second candidate beside Labour Party leader,Eamon Gilmore, in theD\u00fan Laoghaireconstituency for the2011 general election. Gilmore topped the poll, with Bacik receiving 10.1% of first preference votes but she was not elected.[28]She was re-elected toSeanad \u00c9ireannat the subsequent election, after which she became Deputy Leader of the Seanad.[29]She held her seat in the Seanad in 2016 and in 2020.On 27 April 2021, after the resignation ofEoghan Murphyfrom hisD\u00e1ilseat inDublin Bay South, Bacik announced her intention to stand inthe upcoming by-election.[30]She campaigned with an emphasis on providing affordable housing,[31]as well as improving healthcare and childcare, tacklingclimate change, and achieving \"a true republic in which church and state are separated\". During the campaign, she described herself as having \"more bills passed into law than any other Senator, on issues such as workers' conditions, women's health rights, and LGBT equality\".[32]Bacik also campaigned on increasing the number of sports amenities for children in the area, calling for unusedDefence Forcesfootball fields at theCathal Brugha Barracksto be freed up for local sports, with the suggestion rejected by Fine GaelMinister for DefenceSimon Coveney.[33][34]Fine Gael complained to RT\u00c9 after she featured prominently onNational Treasures, a prime-time TV show broadcast by RT\u00c9 during the campaign. RT\u00c9 has strict rules about fair coverage of candidates during campaigns. The national broadcaster blamed an \"inadvertent error\" for the programme being shown three days before the election. A steering group within the broadcaster told Fine Gael that \"the broadcast should not have happened.\" Consequentially, RT\u00c9 had to show a special report on the by-election onPrime Timeto \"ensure fair coverage is given to all candidates\".[35]Bacik won this election, receiving 8,131 (30.2%) first-preference votes. It was her fourth attempt as a Labour candidate, and she expressed her delight at the success at the count centre in the RDS.[36]Following the election, she was described by theIrish Timesas \"a formidable activist and public intellectual\" and that Fine Gael's perceived antipathy towards their former TD,Kate O'Connell, may have contributed to the surge in support to Bacik from women voters. The newspaper claimed that her election was \"a long overdue morale boost\" for Labour.[37]In August 2021, Bacik apologised for attendingKatherine Zappone'scontroversial partyin theMerrion Hotel, Dublin, in July of that year. She stated that she believed that it took place within existing COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.[38][39][40]In March 2022, she confirmed she wouldrunto succeed Alan Kelly as Labour Party leader.[41]Kelly stated that he believed that Bacik would succeed him.[42]On 24 March 2022 she was confirmed as Labour Party leader unopposed at a party conference in Dublin. In a speech, she said she would focus on the rising cost of living and the serious and global problems facing the country.[43]Bacik pledged that Labour would fight the next election as a \"standalone party\" rather than joining any left-wing alliance.[44]Political views[edit]Bacik's policies have been described as liberal andsocial democratic;[45]In 2004 she was described as \"Labour's queen ofpolitical correctness\" in anIrish Independentopinion piece.[46]Since 2007 Bacik has spoken in support of thelegalisation of cannabis.[47]She has proposed that cannabis should be sold under license at music festivals in Ireland such asElectric Picnic, calling for a \"rational\" approach to drugs.[48]Bacik is a supporter of Palestine, and has expressed a desire to see Irish support for Palestine \"reflected in government policies\".[49]In September 2006, Bacik was one of the 61 Irish academic signatories of a letter published inThe Irish Timescalling for an academic boycott of the state ofIsrael.[50]In January 2009, she declared that she wants Ireland to break off diplomatic relations with Israel[51]and in February 2009 called for a general boycott of Israeli goods.[52]After theIsraeli invasion of the Gaza Strip in 2023, Bacik called for a ceasefire in anIrish Independentopinion piece,[53]and said the position ofIsraeli ambassador to Ireland,Dana Erlich, \"should now be under question\" following comments Erlich made.[54]In May 2019, following the results of theMother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigationwhich found that hundreds of children had died while in the care of homes run by the Catholic Church, Bacik called for the government to take financial action against the religious orders involved.[55]In 2020, she sponsored legislation in the Seanad to grant Irish citizenship to any child born on the island of Ireland,[56]which resulted in the Irish citizenship laws being changed in March 2021.[57]In December 2020, she called for foreign frontline medical workers fighting against theCOVID-19 pandemic in Irelandto be rewarded with fast-tracked citizenship applications, as has been done in France.[58]In 2022, Bacik called for a pay rise for workers and awindfall taxon energy companies,[59]and an increase in the minimum wage.[60]In March 2023, she stated that the year's eviction ban was intended to provide the government breathing space to increase housing supply and that the government's targets fell short.[61]Legal work[edit]In 2006, Bacik acted asjunior counselinZappone v. Revenue Commissioners,[62]the unsuccessfulHigh Courtcase brought byKatherine ZapponeandAnn Louise Gilliganover the non-recognition of their Canadiansame-sex marriageby theRevenue Commissioners.[63]She has anLL.B.from TCD and anLL.M.from theLondon School of Economics. She practises as a barrister and taught courses in criminal law; criminology and penology; and feminist theory and law at Trinity. She was Reid Professor of Criminal Law, Criminology andPenologyatTrinity College Dublin(TCD)Law Schoolfrom 1996 to 2022,[64]and was a made aFellowof Trinity College Dublin in 2005.

We would increase the supply of housing by delivering one million homes in 10 years \u2013 50,000 new builds and 50,000 retrofits a year.People who rent deserve the same security as homeowners. I have campaigned for the protection of renters, security of tenure and higher standards for rental accommodation.Land is a finite resource and should be used to benefit the whole community. Property should not be left vacant or speculated on for profit at the expense of public need.Among other issues, I\u2019m calling for a \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 rule for outstanding planning permissions and vacant property.For more on my housing policy, and how we can \u2013 and must \u2013 deliver one million homes in ten years, click here [Link to the Sunday Independent article]Lifelong CareFor many families in Dublin Bay South and beyond, childcare places are not available or not affordable. I have led a campaign for the introduction of a universal public childcare system, providing high-quality affordable childcare options for all parents and children.I am also working with parents\u2019 groups across the constituency to ensure that more funded places are available in local schools for autistic children and children with special or additional needs.Adult care and support policies must also change. For too long, the state has undervalued the role of carers in society.Families should be supported in their decision to care for relatives and there must be better provision of at-home support services. We need a \u2018New Fair Deal\u2019 to support the provision of care at home \u2013 not just in nursing homes.Our nurses, doctors, hospital staff and all those who work in healthcare deserve pay and conditions which reflect their vital role in our community.Climate ActionThe climate crisis is the greatest challenge for our society. I have a long track record on environmental issues and campaigns and was a founding member of Friends of the Earth Ireland.In 2007, as a newly elected senator, I introduced the first Climate Protection Bill seeking to set emissions targets for Ireland.I believe that we need cities built around people, not around cars. As a committed cyclist, I have worked for years to provide for improved cycling infrastructure.Among other Labour climate initiatives, we would introduce a \u20ac9 monthly climate ticket, to provide unlimited public transport journeys \u2013 in order to tackle our over-reliance on private cars and bring down transport costs for households.Alongside our climate measures, we must take urgent action to strengthen our biodiversity. We need to protect our natural habitats and support wildlife in our cities.As a keen sea swimmer, I am also working to improve the quality of Dublin Bay for both water users and marine life. I have introduced a \u2018Dublin Bay Bill\u2019 to provide for a clear statutory framework for the protection and enhancement of our great local amenity, the Bay area.I will continue to advocate for urgent climate action; the ending of reliance on fossil fuels; and the creation of a fairer, greener society.Fair Work, Fair PayI am proud to be a lifelong trade unionist and my ambition is to chart the next phase of workers\u2019 rights in Ireland. Labour has led on so many workers\u2019 rights campaigns, like the campaign for the right to sick leave and to flexible work, equal pay for apprentices and young people and the right to reproductive health leave for women enduring early miscarriage.I believe that the best way to improve pay and conditions is through union representation. I have consistently campaigned for the right to collective bargaining and for trade unions\u2019 and workers\u2019 rights to organise.In this cost-of-living crisis, we know that Ireland needs a pay rise. Along with my Labour colleagues, I have called for the introduction of a living wage and an increase in social welfare payments to ensure an end to poverty in this country, so that no person has to go without heat, food, or other basic services.Sustainable CommunitiesFinally, through our Labour policies on Housing, Care, Climate and Work, we aim to build sustainable communities around Ireland. We are fighting for the preservation and retention of face-to-face support services like citizens\u2019 information centres, and for the investment of significant state resources into strengthening our public amenities and community centres.Join us \u2013www.labour.ie/joinSign Up to receive my newsletter by emailIvana Bacik TDLeinster House,Kildare Street,Dublin 2, Ireland+353 (01) 6183136ivana.bacik@oireachtas.ieFacebookInstagramTwitterPrivacy StatementCookie StatementCopyright \u00a9 2024 Ivana Bacik TDDigital RevolutionariesBack to topOur website uses cookiesWe would like to use cookies on our site.
