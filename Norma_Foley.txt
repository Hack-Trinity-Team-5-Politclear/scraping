She has been aTeachta D\u00e1la(TD) forKerrysince2020.[2]Local politics[edit]Foley was previously a member ofKerry County Councilfor theTraleelocal electoral area, serving from 1994 until her election to the D\u00e1il in 2020. She also served as a member of Tralee Urban District Council until its abolition in 2014.Parliamentary career[edit]After failing in her bid to secure a nomination as a general election candidate inKerry Northin2002, Foley was added to the Fianna F\u00e1il ticket asTom McEllistrim'srunning matein the same constituency in2007.[3]She polled 4,937 first preference votes and finished fifth overall in the three-set constituency after being eliminated on the third count.Foley again failed in her bid to secure a nomination as a general election candidate in2016, but was a late addition to the ticket as a third Fianna F\u00e1il candidate in theKerryconstituency in advance of the2020 general election.[4][5]She polled 6,856 first preference votes and secured the fifth and final seat at the expense of her party colleagueJohn Brassilon the eighth count.[6][7][8]Johnnie Wall was co-opted to Foley's seat on Kerry County Council following her election to the D\u00e1il. On her first day in the D\u00e1il, Foley proposed her party leaderMiche\u00e1l Martinin his successful bid to becomeTaoiseach.Minister for Education[edit]Foley was appointedMinister for Educationin June 2020 following the formation of a newcoalition government, during theCOVID-19 pandemic in Ireland.[9]Her tenure to date has resulted in several gaffes, most prominently involving theCOVID-19 impact on educationand state examinations.[10][11]In September 2020, Foley announced that two coding errors were identified in theLeaving Certificatecalculated grades system.[12]She apologised and announced that around 7,200 students were affected, receiving a higher grade than they should have while some students received a lower grade.[13]It was later confirmed that a third error was identified.[14]In January 2021, Foley and the government were forced to abandon plans for Leaving Certificate students to attend school for three days a week, and instead students would return to homeschooling until February, after theASTIdirected its members not to return to in-school teaching.[15]Also in January, Foley was forced to abandon plans to reopen special schools for thousands of children with special educational needs following safety concerns among staff unions.[16]In February, Foley announced a new phase of planning for the Leaving Certificate exams,[17]but the ASTI withdrew from discussions with the Department of Education after it said that the plan being developed would not provide a \"meaningful Leaving Certificate\" for students.[18]In March, she lost her appeals against findings that two home-schooled students were unfairly excluded from the Leaving Certificate calculated grades process.[19]On 17 December 2022, she was re-appointed to the same position following Leo Varadkar's appointment as Taoiseach.[20]Personal life[edit]Prior to becoming a TD, she was a teacher at Presentation Secondary School, Tralee. She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire. Her parents are Denis and Hannah Foley. Her fatherDenis Foleywas a Fianna F\u00e1il TD forKerry Northfrom 1981 to 1989 and 1992 to 2002.[citation needed]References[edit]^\"Norma Foley (b. 1970) - Irish Life and Lore\".irishlifeandlore.com.

The Minister sits down with Ciar\u00e1n Galway to talk equality of opportunity, access, teacher recruitment, reform, and her vision for education in Ireland.Sitting at a large conference table at the centre of her office off the ministerial corridor in Leinster House, the Education Minister is overlooked by select scattering of children\u2019s artwork exhibited on the walls, not least an homage to the woman herself. Naturally enough, these are complemented by picturesque County Kerry landscapes.Norma Foley is equipped with over 20 years of teaching experience \u2013 first as an Irish and English teacher at St Aloysius in Carrigtwohill, County Cork and then at Presentation Secondary School in her hometown of Tralee.Allied to this is a strong political lineage \u2013 her father Denis Foley was twice elected as a Fianna F\u00e1il TD for Kerry North. Ascension to the education portfolio, therefore, appears to be a perfect marriage of her persona.Having previously served on Kerry County Council between 2004 and 2019 \u2013 including as mayor in 2018/2019 \u2013 Foley secured the fifth D\u00e1il seat in the Kerry constituency for Fianna F\u00e1il in February 2020. Embarking on a career break from her teaching post, following government formation she achieved the distinction of becoming the first woman from Kerry to sit at Cabinet when she was appointed Education Minister.Acknowledging that she has brought \u201ca particular perspective\u201d to the role, the Minister recalls: \u201cI would always say to my own students that my ambition for them is limitless, there is nothing that they cannot do, and nothing that they should feel that they could not achieve. We need to make sure that they have the support and the opportunity, at all times, to realise whatever their dreams or ambitions might be.\u201dPrioritiesOutlining her strategic priorities as Minister for Education, Foley identifies several key policy themes and associated initiatives, including:equality of opportunity;access to education; andinclusive education.Free schoolbooksFoley\u2019s self-stated priority in education is equality of opportunity. Rationalising the introduction of the free schoolbook initiative at primary school level at a cost of \u20ac55 million in 2023/2024, she insists: \u201cI do not believe that any child should feel disadvantaged, because they did not have the resources at home to purchase whatever they require for school or for their education.\u201dHowever, while Budget 2024 extended the initiative to Junior Cycle students at a cost of \u20ac67 million, political opponents criticised this iterative approach, characterising it as a \u2018missed opportunity\u2019 to make both primary and secondary school education \u2018genuinely free\u2019.Responding to this, the Minister defends the decision, indicating that there was method behind the initiative\u2019s implementation, including a budgetary consideration, and a determination to ensure its success.Articulating her department\u2019s logic, she explains:\u00ad \u201cWe are doing it this way because we were very clear that there would be great learning for us out of how it went in primary schools. A review has been done and is ongoing in relation to how that worked, what might we do differently as we move into the post-primary element of it, and we bring that learning into post-primary. Then how it works at Junior Cycle level will inform how we will deliver it at Senior Cycle.\u201d\u201cFianna F\u00e1il has always believed that education is the great leveller. I believe that fundamentally myself.\u201dMinister for Education Norma Foley TDSpecial educationOur conversation then pivots to special education. After announcing the establishment of four new special schools for 2024/2025 in Limerick city; Enfield, County Meath; Gower, County Wexford; and in \u201cthe south Kildare area\u201d, in addition to seven special schools established in Dublin and Cork in the previous four years, the Minister is evidently buoyed.However, as government seeks to recruit 744 additional special education teachers into the profession, alongside 1,216 additional special needs assistants (SNAs), ensuring sufficient skills capacity will inevitably be a challenge.Yet, with over 20,000 SNAs \u2013 and a target of 21,000 by the end of 2024 \u2013 already among 40,000 professionals dedicated to special education, the Minister insists: \u201cWe have not had difficulty around [recruitment of] SNAs, I want to be very clear around that. We have very good uptake and [they are] adding so much and bringing extraordinary giftedness also into the world of special education.\u201dIn terms of special teachers, meanwhile, the Minister emphasises that \u201cwe are a country at near full employment\u201d and that this is creating a staffing challenges in education, as well as other sectors.Staffing initiativesOutlining the measures introduced by the Government in response to these challenges, she highlights:the introduction of a \u20ac2,000 bursary for postgraduate teaching students upon completion of their course;free of charge upskilling courses for teaching staff to support subject areas which are experiencing particular challenges;1,000 additional posts of responsibility being introduced;working with the higher education institutes to release 3,000 student teachers into the system in 2023/2024;increasing the number of days being provided by retired teachers into the system;exploring shared teacher schemes; andintroducing a pathway for teachers who qualified outside the State to register complete their Droichead induction in Ireland.\u201cWe are constantly looking at ways and means to ensure that there is a sufficiency,\u201d Foley remarks, qualifying: \u201cBut I do not for one minute underestimate the challenge and the difficulty that there can be for principals in particular areas at particular times. So, we are happy to look at any measures going forward as well. We have been proactive in this space and will continue to be proactive in the space.\u201dTeacher shortageRegardless, a collaborative recruitment and retention survey published by the Irish National Teachers\u2019 Organisation (INTO), the Irish Primary Principals\u2019 Network (IPPN), and the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association (CPSMA) in November 2023 indicated that there was an \u201cunprecedented level of vacant teaching posts in primary and special schools\u201d.INTO Deputy General Secretary Deirdre O\u2019Connor commented: \u201cThis survey indicates that in the schools who responded, there is a current shortfall of 809 teaching posts in the schools surveyed, with another 1,202 expected vacancies in the next three months. In the midst of a staffing crisis in our schools, particularly in our urban areas, all options must actively be explored to ensure that no child is left without a qualified teacher.\u201dAsked about the extent to which the shortage of teachers in primary and secondary schools can be characterised as a recruitment and retention crisis, the Minister insists that retention is not a challenge.\u201cOur staff that are in the system are staying in the system by and large,\u201d she says: adding: \u201cEven in terms of those who might choose to leave early, it is very, very low if you were to look at it comparatively across other sectors.\u201dOn recruitment, Foley responds: \u201cIt is important to say that we have never had as many teachers registered with the Teaching Council as we do presently.\u201dWhile this statement aligns with the fact that the Register of Teachers has expanded each year since 2006, with an annual net growth of 3,600 registrants according to Director of the Teaching Council, Lynn Ramsey, it may suggest that even increased teaching numbers cannot keep pace with rapidly evolving demographic pressures.CAO applicantsHowever, as a third-level qualification, teaching, the Minister insists, is still an attractive option for CAO applicants. \u201cAcross the CAO, we have seen a 14 per cent increase this year [2023] and that is on top of 9 per cent increase last year [2022],\u201d she highlights.Not taking account of trends prior to 2022, this is accurate in one sense. CSO figures from July 2023 recorded 2,450 first preference applications for primary teaching and 2,561 first preference applications for post-primary teaching, compared with 2,592 and 2,242 in July 2022 respectively. This represents an annual decrease of 5.5 per cent in primary teaching and an annual increase of 14.2 per cent in post-primary teaching.ChallengesAcknowledging that there are \u201cdifficulties and challenges in some areas\u201d of teacher recruitment, the Minister restates the Government\u2019s measures to address these and reiterates: \u201cThere will always be challenges, but again, you must remember, there is a backdrop of near full employment in this country.\u201dOverall though, as \u201csomebody who comes from the teaching profession\u201d, the Minister believes that teaching remains an attractive career prospect, as illustrated by CAO applications. Again emphasising that teaching \u201cit is not a career without challenges\u201d, she concedes that \u201cmore and more has been asked every single day of the education sector\u201d.Illustrating this point, she highlights the pivot to remote learning during the Covid pandemic, and classroom demographic changes amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine as two examples of \u201cthe education sector [stepping] up to the mark every single day\u201d.Housing crisisAsked about the extent to which the housing crisis and the associated dearth of affordable accommodation is impacting on recruitment, especially for newly qualified teachers, the Minister emphasises that \u201cthe issues around housing are impacting lots of people in lots of different careers and professions\u201d and that government is \u201cbeing proactive in this space\u201d.\u201cIt is no one measure that is going to eradicate the issues that we have at the minute but there is a general acknowledgement across government that \u2013 and [Housing] Minister Darragh O\u2019Brien TD\u2008is working assiduously in this area \u2013 a whole suite of measures at different times to meet the different needs and the different challenges of people is what is required and each one of them needs to be supported,\u201d she remarks.Senior Cycle reformPivoting to address a final priority, the Minister delves into Senior Cycle reform. Alongside a new Primary Curriculum Framework, in March 2022, the Minister published the plan to reimagine Senior Cycle education. Guided by a vision of \u201cequity and excellence for all\u201d, the plan has three objectives:\u201cempower students to meet the challenges of the 21 century\u201d;\u201cenrich the student experience and build on what is strong in our current system\u201d; and\u201cembed wellbeing and reduce student stress levels\u201d.\u201cWe have a Leaving Certificate, which is very highly respected and rightly so, but we have an acknowledgement as well that we can never stand still in education and if we want our young people to compete as we are doing here, for example, in [the OECD\u2019s 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022], but to compete across the world now, they have to have appropriate curricula and they have to have appropriate assessment as well.\u201dConsequently, an updated programme was announced in September 2023 to accelerate Senior Cycle reform, including the introduction of two new Leaving Certificate subjects \u2013 drama, film and theatre studies, and climate action and sustainable development \u2013 for students in 2024/2025.Contextualising this, the Education Minister contends that an achievement in a subject like drama, theatre, and film studies should have parity with an achievement in any other subject \u201cbecause that is a talent and that is an ability\u201d.AssessmentAs well as introducing new subjects, the government is also overhauling Senior Cycle assessment. On a personal level, Minister states that she \u201cnever felt it was right that 100 per cent of a student\u2019s ability could be examined on one single day in one moment in June\u201d.In practice, this means ensuring that each subject has a second assessment component. As such, in future, at least 40 per cent of each Leaving Certificate subject will be assessed by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) prior to students sitting exams in June.\u201cThe type of assessment will be different to what they are doing presently. For example, there will always be a place for the written exam but there has to be a place as well for application of knowledge,\u201d she insists.Similarly, since the Covid pandemic, students have been provided with an opportunity for a second sitting of the Leaving Certificate. Emphasising the Department of Education\u2019s role in serving students, the Minister adds: \u201cI think that is fair. I think if there are circumstances from a health and wellness point of view that prevented a student from taking an exam in June, to the best of our ability we should be able to provide a second opportunity.\u201cI want students to succeed to the maximum. For them to be able to do that, I have to ensure that they get the maximum of facility to do it\u2026 recognising their individuality in terms of their various talents.\u201dReferencing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the context of assessment, the Minister notes that a work is underway. \u201cWe have tasked the SEC to look specifically at how we can harness the opportunity that AI is bringing to us, but also be mindful of the challenges. That also will inform how Senior Cycle and how education will work going forward.\u201dAll-island cooperationTurning to the Government\u2019s efforts to deepen all-island education connections and cooperation, Foley indicates that \u201ca significant body of work is underway under the auspices of the Shared Island Programme\u201d.\u201cWe are currently working on a north/south programme \u2013 and more of those details will unfold \u2013 but it is specifically in the area of education, and specifically in the area of [tackling] disadvantage in education and promoting equality of education.\u201cI am a huge believer in the wisdom of the collective. We can garner so much more when we work with others and there are great opportunities in education for us to share expertise and wisdom and experience. We are in the throes of doing that now, and you can see it from a higher education point of view in terms of research and an infrastructure point of view. Financial supports have already been put in place. There is enormous scope. Look, we are one island at the end of the day.\u201dAsked if she has given consideration to the INTO\u2019s calls for an all-Ireland teaching council to be established within the Department of the Taoiseach\u2019s Shared Island Unit amid the \u201cerosion of teachers\u2019 conditions in the North\u201d, the Minister is reticent.\u201cI am not going to comment on that,\u201d she says, before adding: \u201cLook, we have young people from Northern Ireland who are [living] on the border and working in the south, and we have people [living] in the south and working and crossing over.\u201cObviously, the more closely we can work together, learn from each other, and support each other [the better]\u2026 Opportunities going forward in terms of the teaching council and all of that, I have no doubt that all these opportunities can be looked at going forward.\u201d\u201cLook, we are one island at the end of the day.\u201dVision for educationAsserting that education is at \u201cthe very core\u201d of her party\u2019s philosophy, Foley outlines: \u201cFianna F\u00e1il has always believed that education is the great leveller. I believe that fundamentally myself. It is the great leveller in society. If we can get it right in education, ultimately, we will get it right in society. That means ensuring that we have an education system that is inclusive, that is open and welcoming to everyone, and that is ambitious. We should always be ambitious as a country, so we should always have an ambitious education system.\u201dPaying tribute to the \u201cmany who contributed to the richness of education\u201d, Foley articulates her belief in \u201cthe capacity of Irish people\u201d. \u201cWe see Irish people perform every day, not just on the local and the national stage, but on the international stage. That is the consequence of opportunity being provided, supports being provided, a good education, and a rootedness in community. I would like to think that we will continue that; that we will continue in education to promote equality, to promote inclusion, and to promote opportunity and access for all.\u201dTagsIssue 61December 2023Show MoreShareFacebookXLinkedInWhatsAppShare via EmailCheck AlsoCloseEducationGet ahead with NZEB and retrofit trainingDecember 2023AnalysisGovernment misses waiting list reduction targetAnalysis,IssuesHousing 2022 reflections  Overall housing target on track but crisis aboundsAnalysis,IssuesGalway City: The beating heart of the westAnalysis,Regional focus: Galway City CouncilThe cost-of-living budgetAnalysis,IssuesCategoriesCategoriesSelect Category100 years of policing reportAgribusiness magazineAgriculture Food and DrinkAnalysisBanking & FinanceBrexitBusinessClimate COP26 reportConnectivity and future of workConnectivity reportCover StoryCybersecurity reportData protection reportDelivering cost rental housing reportDigitalDigital government reportDigital government reportEconomyEducationEnergy & EnvironmentEnergyEnvironmentRetrofiteolasEurope and BrexitFeaturedFintech ReportFuture of policing reportFuture of rail reportFuture of work and connectivity reportHealth and care servicesHousingInfrastructureRoad safetyInfrastructure and construction reportIssuesJusticeLocal GovernmentLocal government reportMol an \u00f3igePeoplePoliticsPublic AffairsReformRegional focus: Galway City CouncilRegional focus: Leitrim County CouncilReportsArtificial intelligence reportInfrastructure and construction reportRetrofitting reportRound table discussion: Cyber-resilience in an age of ransomwareRound table discussion: Digital transformation of public servicesRound table discussion: Driving electric vehicle adoption in IrelandRound table discussion: Evolution or revolution?

Her father, Denis Foley, was born in the building in Day Place, Tralee which housed the Fianna F\u00e1il headquarters where his parents were caretakers. Her mother, Hannah O\u2019Halloran is a native of Ballyheigue. She discusses her father\u2019s various roles in Fianna F\u00e1il politics and she recalls standing on a butter box and addressing Mass-goers at election time in earlier days. Track 2: She discusses the differences between old school politics at local level and those of today, and she explains that she was elected to Tralee Urban District Council in 1994. Gender in local politics is also discussed as is the abbreviated terms used at Council meetings with which she had to quickly familiarise herself on her election. Track 3: A discussion on the support for Fianna F\u00e1il in local government follows, and she explains that she serves on both the UDC and Kerry County Council. The management of the Town Council and agendas are also discussed, as are the engagement with management by all the councillors. The importance of getting the correct message from Council to the local media is emphasised.  Track 4: In 2004, she was elected to Kerry County Council and she describes the cross-over in responsibilities between the two Councils. She discusses the work she undertook during her tenure as a member of Tralee UDC and as Mayor on two occasions, including Public and Private Partnership and her work with refugees from Kosovo and with asylum seekers. Track 5: The Rose of Tralee Festival and Tralee Races are mentioned, and the changes in the organisation of the Festival over the years are explored. Her own career as a post-primary teacher at Presentation School in Tralee is also mentioned, as are her views on the role of the Tralee Chamber Alliance. She welcomes the challenges which may arise following the establishment of the new Municipal Council.Additional informationType:Disk, MP3Audio series:Reflections on the Urban District of Tralee CollectionBitrate:128 kbpsDownload time limit:48 hoursFile size(s):10.00 MB, 6.75 MB, 4.82 MB, 9.24 MB, 13.37 MBNumber of files:5Product ID:CDTTC01-06Subject:A life in local politicsRecorded by:Maurice O\u2019Keeffe \u2013 Irish Life and LoreSKU:N/ACategory:Reflections on the Urban District of Tralee CollectionTag:Local governmentRelated productsDublin county (south), first seriesMICHAEL BRENNAN, AGE 70, BALLYROAN, KNOCKLYON (Part 1)\u20ac10.00\u2013\u20ac15.00Select optionsCarlow county, first seriesJohn English (aged 72)\u20ac10.00\u2013\u20ac15.00Select optionsDublin county (south), first seriesMICHAEL COLEMAN, AGE 61, KNOCKLYON (Part 1)\u20ac10.00\u2013\u20ac15.00Select optionsDublin county (south), first seriesRODERICK KERNAN, AGE 80, TEMPLEOGUE\u20ac10.00\u2013\u20ac15.00Select optionsSubscribe to our NewsletterEmail*We are collecting your email address in order to send you news and updates on our latest products.
