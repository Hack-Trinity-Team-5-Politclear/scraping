Photograph: Gareth Chaney/CollinsRonan JudgeThu Jan 18 2024 - 19:11A 47-year-old man who appeared in court charged with making a threat to kill or cause serious harm to the Government Chief Whip Hildegarde Naughton must stay away from the homes and offices of all Galway politicians.The condition is one of a number of imposed on Daragh O\u2019Flaherty at Galway District Court on Wednesday.O\u2019Flaherty, with an address at New Estate, Clarinbridge, is charged with, without lawful excuse, making to Hildegarde Naughton, a threat, intending her to believe it would be carried out, to kill or cause serious harm.The alleged offence is contrary to section 5 of the Non Fatal Offences Against The Person Act. The incident is alleged to have occurred on January 10th last in Galway .READ MOREMost things you\u2019ve heard about eating meat are wrong, say Irish scientistsDavid McWilliams: Is it any wonder that Ireland\u2019s public transport is among the worst in Europe?From Maltesers to lucky underpants - the superstitious piseogs entrenched in Kerry football\u2018I  hate this job\u2019: What makes Keir Starmer tick?Ms Naughton is a Fine Gael TD for Galway west.Mr O\u2019Flaherty was remanded on bail subject to conditions.In court, Garda John Kerrigan gave evidence of arrest, charge and caution.He said that in reply to the single charge, Mr O\u2019Flaherty said: \u201cThere is a boy in a well. He is drowning in vaccine juice. The government keeps throwing people into the well. The media and corporations keep their foot on their head so the establishment can pretend there is no one in the well, and garda\u00ed and the judiciary pretend the well does not exist. The national order must be restored.\u201dJudge Adrian Harris asked Garda Kerrigan to slowly go through the reply as it was quite lengthy. Mr O\u2019Flaherty repeated the reply in court as Judge Harris took a note.Garda Kerrigan said the State consented to bail subject to the accused abiding by certain conditions.Gda Kerrigan said as part of the bail conditions, Mr O\u2019Flaherty must reside at his given address, sign on twice a week at a Galway garda station and have no contact with the alleged injured party.The accused must also stay away from the homes and offices of all Galway politicians and refrain from posting threatening and abusive content on social media or other internet platforms.Solicitor John Martin was granted legal aid to represent the accused.Mr Martin told the court the conditions were broadly agreed but his client objected to signing on twice a week and having to refrain from posting threatening and abusive content.Mr O\u2019Flaherty told the court he was willing to sign on once a week. He said as part of his work he travels around Ireland \u201ceducating\u201d and \u201cmotivating\u201d communities.He said he doesn\u2019t get paid for this work, has a low income and has to spend a lot of his money on bus tickets for travel.Judge Harris said there are already laws in place regarding threatening and abusive behaviour and after a brief conversation with the judge, Mr O\u2019Flaherty agreed to abide by the condition.Judge Harris said he would accede to the defence application to have the signing on condition reduced to once a week.Mr O\u2019Flaherty was remanded on bail to appear again in court on March 13th for directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions.Sign up forpush alertsand have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phoneFindThe Irish Times on WhatsAppand stay up to dateOur In The News podcast is now published daily \u2013 Find the latest episodehereHildegarde NaughtonIN THIS SECTIONMichael Flatley\u2019s Castlehyde House could be in jeopardy if insurer cancels policy, court toldTwo men charged over seizure of \u20ac33m worth of crystal meth in Cork last weekUkraine war among reasons for fall-out of business partners, court hearsDenis O\u2019Brien can reassert \u2018truth and honest opinion\u2019 defence to solicitors\u2019 defamation claims, court rulesCourt of Appeal overturns decision preventing two children from being returned to birth countryMOST READMorris O\u2019Shea Salazar: How Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa drugs cartel developed a Kerry connectionRT\u00c9 board members \u2018furious, insulted and fed up\u2019 over forced resignation of chairMan jailed for two months as a \u2018deterrent\u2019 after he arrived at Dublin Airport without a passportIs it any wonder that Ireland\u2019s public transport is among the worst in Europe?\u2018You\u2019d be out of your mind to go there\u2019: How witnesses really feel about Oireachtas committeesLATEST STORIESZelenskiy welcomes western leaders in Kyiv as Ukraine marks second anniversary of Russian invasionIreland v Wales: Live updates from Six Nations clash in DublinDeath toll from Valencia apartment block fire rises to 10Winning start for AntoineDupont in Sevens as France record double victoriesPadraig Harrington moves up the leaderboard in Mexico;

cannabis in her 20s in IrelandMinister of State Hildegarde NaughtonPhilip RyanWed 22 Feb 2023 at 11:49Fine Gael Drugs Strategy Minister Hildegarde Naughton has revealed she illegally smoked cannabis in Ireland while in her 20s.Ms Naughton\u2019s comments come after Justice Minister Simon Harris said anyone who has knowledge of drug use in Leinster House should report it to garda\u00ed.The two Fine Gael Cabinet members were speaking at a party event organised to promote the Government\u2019s cost of living package.However, when asked about a claim by Sinn F\u00e9in TD Dessie Ellis that cocaine is being used in D\u00e1il Eireann, Mr Harris said \u201cit should be reported to the garda\u00ed\u201d as the \u201claw of the land\u201d is that certain drugs are illegal.Mr Harris said he wants to \u201cdifferentiate\u201d between helping people who are addicted to drugs and those who \u201chave a pint and pop a pill\u201d at weekends.\u201cI made comments last week in relation to drug taking, which I stand by and double down on, the reality of the situation here is that there is a very significant prevalence of drug use in our country.\u201cI'm not talking about people with drug addiction. I'm talking about what might be described as social, casual or recreational drug use. There is a direct correlation between that and funding and fuelling gangs that bring misery to communities, including ones that we talk about on a regular basis,\u201d Mr Harris added.The minister left the press conference but other Fine Gael members including Ms Naughton, who is the\u00a0Government Chief Whip, were asked if they had taken drugs.Ms Naughton said she \u201ctried cannabis\u201d in her 20s adding that \u201cit wasn't for me\u201d. She also confirmed she took the illegal drug while in Ireland.She said she has not tried cannabis since and said research shows people who experimented with the drug did not necessarily\u00a0continue to use it.Recently appointed Fine Gael Minister of State, Neale Richmond, said he tried cannabis while in Holland where it is legal to take the drug but said he had\u00a0a \u201chorrible experience\u201d.Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe said he has not taken any illegal substances.\u00a0 Fine Gael Senators Barry Ward and Mary Seery Kearney also said they have not taken drugs.Ms Naughton, who is overseeing the introduction of a new Citizen\u2019s Assembly on drug policy, said she hoped it would lead to an \u201copen and honest conversation about drug use in Ireland\u201d\u201cAs minister with responsibility for the drug strategy I want to ensure that what comes out of the citizens assembly feeds then into the policy that we can implement and what we want to do is hear from the lived experience of those who use drugs, families, communities, those who work directly in this area, and also to look at best practice internationally,\u201d she added.Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channelStay up to date with all the latest newsLatest PoliticsCatherine Martin in war of words with RT\u00c9\u2019s board after chair Si\u00fan N\u00ed Raghallaigh effectively \u2018sacked\u2019 live on TVLower rates for school buses to stay for another academic year, with plans to expand eligibilityMarch referendums focus on family, but it\u2019s hard to ignore the anti-immigrant agenda from someDrug cautions system \u2018clearly not working\u2019 as cannabis possession charges top 17,000Sammy Wilson quits as DUP\u2019s chief whip at Westminster following party\u2019s Stormont return\u2018Concerning situation\u2019 as around 1,000 male asylum seekers now without accommodation in IrelandMinister Helen McEntee says Ireland needs to be \u2018realistic\u2019 about domestic violence refuge spaces, as Cuan agency launchedMore than 2,000 carers to get state pension after reformsFianna F\u00e1il backbenchers want more countries put on \u2018safe\u2019 listExplainer: Why the FAI was called before the Public Accounts Committee \u2013 and a redacted email caused annoyance among TDsShow moreTop StoriesSoccerExclusive|The Stephen Kenny interview: \u2018Some people don\u2019t just want to criticise you, they really want to seriously damage your reputation\u2019Irish News\u2018Abusers hide in plain sight, he was a monster behind closed doors,\u2019 says stepdaughter of paedophile ex-rugby player Davy TweedNewsTipperary engineering firm offers \u20ac10,000 reward to catch thieves who stole goods worth over \u20ac70,000CelebrityMel B says she was left with \u00a3700 to her name and forced to shop in Aldi after divorceLatest NewsMoreCelebrity NewsVin Diesel shares update on Fast And Furious \u2018grand finale\u201914:35GAAOutgoing GAA president Larry McCarthy describes Belfast court sitting as the \u2018worst day\u2019 of his three-year tenure14:33GAAGAA Congress: Motion to allow players to play U20 and senior inter-county championship games in same week passed14:22Six NationsLive|Ireland v Wales, Six Nations \u2013 Andy Farrell\u2019s men seek win to keep Grand Slam bid alive14:10GAAGAA Congress: Verbal abuse of match officials to carry minimum two-match ban13:46Celebrity NewsGraham Norton announces he is quitting Virgin Radio weekend shows13:30CrimeMichael Lynn enjoys \u2018model prisoner\u2019 status behind bars13:25RadioGraham Norton confirms he is leaving Virgin Radio weekend show with Irish presenter to fill in as temporary replacement13:24CelebrityMel B says she was left with \u00a3700 to her name and forced to shop in Aldi after divorce12:56EuropeDeath toll in Spain apartment block fire rises to 1012:56Top StoriesMoreCrimeMichael Lynn enjoys \u2018model prisoner\u2019 status behind barsSix NationsLive|Ireland v Wales, Six Nations \u2013 Andy Farrell\u2019s men seek win to keep Grand Slam bid aliveSex & RelationshipsAsking for a friend: My family took my husband\u2019s side after I cheated and moved in with my new partner.
