The RUC officer shot McDermott dead; Doherty and another man[who?]escaped.[7][8]At her trial, she refused to recognise the court as it was an institution of the British state.[8]She was sentenced to fourteen years in prison for explosives offences, firearms offences, and belonging to an illegal organisation.[9]Imprisonment, 1976\u20131986[edit]AtArmagh prison, Farrell was the official Officer Commanding of the female IRA prisoners.[10]When she arrived in Armagh, Farrell refused to wear aprison uniformin protest at the designation of republican prisoners as criminals. She was the first woman to do so, and the second person afterKieran Nugent, a prisoner in theH-Blocks of HMP Maze. Farrell instigated adirty protestin February 1980. This meant that prisoners refused to slop-out and would smearexcrementandmenstrualmaterial on the walls of their cells instead of risking being attacked by the guards whileslopping out.[11][12][13][14][15][16]After 13 months, Farrell, along with Mary Doyle and Mairead Nugent, began a hunger strike in Armagh prison to coincide with the one already taking place inLong Kesh.[17]It ended on 19 December, a day after the men's strike. The dirty protest ended in March 1981 as the prisoners' rights campaign was focused on thehunger strikebeing undertaken byBobby Sands, leader of IRA prisoners in the H-Blocks. She was one of the H-Block/Armagh prisoners to stand for election in the Republic of Ireland in the 1981 General Election, standing inCork North-Centraland polling 2,751 votes (6.05%).[18]Second phase of IRA activity and subsequent death[edit]Upon her release from prison in October 1986,[19]Farrell enrolled atQueen's University, Belfastfor a course in Political Science and Economics. However, she dropped out of university to re-engage in IRA activity. The IRA sent her withSean SavageandDaniel McCannto theBritish overseas territoryofGibraltarto plant acar bombin a heavily populated town area. The target was the band and guard of the 1st Battalion of theRoyal Anglian Regimentduring a weekly ceremonial changing of the guard in front ofGovernors' residence, on 8 March 1988. According to interrogated IRA members, Gibraltar had been selected as a target because it was a British possession that was in dispute, and that it was an area with lighter security measures than at that time had become endemic at British military installations elsewhere due to the IRA's campaign.[20]The British Government's domestic intelligence serviceMI5had become aware of their plan,[when?]and a detachment from theBritish Armywas specifically deployed to Gibraltar[when?]to intercept the IRA team and prevent the attack.[20]Farrell, Savage and McCann were confronted by plainclothes soldiers from theSpecial Air ServiceRegiment whilst they were engaged in a reconnaissance in Gibraltar pending the delivery of the car bomb. Farrell was shot three times in the back and once in the face, her two accomplices were also killed in an operation code-namedOperation Flaviusby the British Government. Some witnesses to the shooting stated that Farrell and McCann had been shot while attempting to surrender, and while lying wounded on the ground.[20]The three IRA members were all found afterwards to be unarmed. Keys to a hire car found in Farrell's handbag led the Spanish Police, who had closely worked with the British security services in Operation Flavius, to the discovery across the border in Spain of five packages totalling 84\u00a0kg ofSemtexexplosive in a car which the IRA team had intended to subsequently drive into Gibraltar for the attack. These packages had four separate detonators attached. Around this was packed 200 rounds of ammunition asshrapnel. There were two timers, marked 10 hrs 45 mins and 11 hrs 15 mins respectively, but they were not primed or connected.[20]Gibraltar inquest[edit]At the inquest into the deaths held in Gibraltar the jury returned a verdict oflawful killingby a 9\u20132 majority.[21]The coroner, in summing up the evidence to the jury, told them to avoid anopen verdict. The 9\u20132 verdict is the smallest majority allowed. Paddy McGrory, lawyer forAmnesty International, believed that it had been a \"perverse verdict,\" and that it had gone against the weight of the evidence.[22]Ms Proetta, an independent witness, toldThames Television, 'They [the security forces] didn't do anything ... they just went and shot these people. That's all. They didn't say anything, they didn't scream, they didn't shout, they didn't do anything. These people were turning their heads back to see what was happening and when they saw these men had guns in their hands they put their hands up. It looked like the man was protecting the girl because he stood in front of her, but there was no chance. I mean they went to the floor immediately, they dropped.'[23]Stephen Bullock, a lawyer by profession, who was 150 metres from the shooting, and another independent witness saw Dan McCann falling backwards with his hands at shoulder height. At the inquest into the killings Bullock stated, 'I think with one step he could have actually touched the person he was shooting'.[23]The researcher for Thames Television which made the programmeDeath on the Rockbelieved Ms Proetta's evidence as it matched another account they had received.[24]The scientific evidence provided by pathologist Professor Alan Watson also corroborated the evidence of Proetta, Bullock and a third witness, Josie Celecia.[23]Five independent civil liberty organisations have criticised many aspects of the proceedings during the inquest, and have called for further inquiries into the killings in Gibraltar. They are theInternational Association of Democratic Lawyers,Inquest the National Council for Civil Liberties(London), theInternational League for Human Rights(New York) and Amnesty International.[25]The report by Amnesty International stated that the inquest had failed to answer 'the fundamental issue... whether the fatal shootings were caused by what happened in the street, or whether the authorities planned in advance for the three to be shot dead.'[26]European Court of Human Rights[edit]The relatives of McCann, Savage and Farrell were dissatisfied with the response to their case in the British legal system,[27]so they took their case to theEuropean Court of Human Rightsin 1995. The court found that the three had been unlawfully killed.[27]By a 10\u20139 majority it ruled that the human rights of the 'Gibraltar Three' had been infringed in breach of Article 2 \u2013 right to life, of theEuropean Convention on Human Rightsand criticised the authorities for lack of appropriate care in the control and organisation of the arrest operation.[28]In sum, having regard to the decision not to prevent the suspects from travelling into Gibraltar, to the failure of the authorities to make sufficient allowances for the possibility that their intelligence assessments might, in some respects at least, be erroneous and to the automatic recourse to lethal force when the soldiers opened fire, the Court is not persuaded that the killing of the three terrorists constituted the use of force which was no more than absolutely necessary in defence of persons from unlawful violence within the meaning of Article 2(2)(a) of the Convention[20]In the Judgement the court said that the actions of the authorities lacked 'the degree of caution in the use of firearms to be expected from law enforcement personnel in a democratic society.'[29][30]Some newspapers reported the decision as a finding that the three had been unlawfully killed.[31][32][33]The ECHR also ruled that the three had been engaged in an act of terrorism, and consequently dismissed unanimously the applicants' claims for damages, for costs and expenses incurred in the Gibraltar Inquest and the remainder of the claims for just satisfaction.[34]The Court is not empowered to overrule national decisions or annul national laws.[35]Related events[edit]In the aftermath of the shooting on Gibraltar, violence escalated in the Belfast area and resulted in at least six further deaths.\nThe three bodies were returned to Belfast on 14 March. That evening an IRA sniper, Kevin McCracken, was shot dead in Norglen Crescent,Turf Lodge, Belfast while preparing to attack British soldiers.[36][37]Those attending the return of the bodies said that the security services were harassing them[38]and that he was attacking the security services to deflect their attention. According to witnesses, McCracken was beaten while lying wounded by members of the security services.[39]At the funeral of the 'Gibraltar Three' on 16 March, three mourners were killed in a gun and grenade attack byloyalistparamilitaryMichael Stonein theMilltown Cemetery attack.At the funeral of IRA member Caoimh\u00edn Mac Br\u00e1daigh on 19 March \u2013 one of the three men killed three days earlier by Michael Stone \u2013 two British Army corporals, Derek Wood and David Howes, drove into the funeral cort\u00e8ge, apparently by accident but mourners evidently feared an attack similar to Stone's was taking place.[19]Scenes relayed on television showed the two corporals being cornered by black taxis and dragged from their car before beingtaken away to be beaten, stripped, and then executed.[40]On 10 September 1990, the IRA attempted to kill Air Chief Marshal SirPeter Terryat hisStaffordshirehome. Terry had been a prime target since his days as Governor of Gibraltar, where he signed the documents allowing the SAS to pursue IRA members. The attack took place at 9\u00a0pm at the Main Road house. The gunman opened fire through a window hitting Sir Peter at least nine times and injuring his wife near one of her eyes. The couple's daughter was found to be suffering from shock. Terry's face had to be rebuilt as the shots shattered his face and two high-velocity bullets were within millimetres of his brain.[41]A few months before she was killed, Farrell had been interviewed for the documentaryMother Ireland, directed by Anne Crilly, which was subsequently deemed untransmittable due to the1988 broadcasting restrictions.Channel 4eventually screened the documentary on 11 April 1991, with Farrell's voice having been de-dubbed to comply with the restrictions.[42][43]In 2008 Sinn F\u00e9in asked to hold anInternational Women's Dayevent in the Long Gallery at Stormont commemorating Farrell. The Assembly Commission, which runs the Stormont estate, ruled that it could not go ahead.[44]Media comment[edit]The New York Times, reviewing aFrontlinedocumentary examining the circumstances of Farrell's death, stated: 'Miss Farrell might be dismissed as some wild-eyed fanatic except that part of her life has been preserved in several home movies and a television interview taped shortly before her death. What emerges is a portrait of a soft-spoken, attractive woman determined to end what she perceived as the injustices surrounding her everyday life.... The program leaves us pondering the obvious conclusion: \"To the people of Falls Road she was a patriot. To the British she was a terrorist. To her family she was a victim of Irish history.\"'[45]See also[edit]Death on the Rock; a documentary about the shootingsNotes[edit]^Rolston, Bill (2000).Unfinished Business: State Killings and the Quest for Truth.

I always loved Irish history and what I think sparked it off for me was when we were in second year or third year. We were reading P\u00e1draig Pearse\u2019s oration at [Jeremiah] O\u2019Donovan Rossa\u2019s grave,\u201d she recounts.Around the same time, the Farrell family canvassed for Independent TD Catherine Connolly \u2013 now a constituency colleague in Galway West \u2013 and her sister, Colette Connolly, a former Mayor of Galway City Council. \u201cIn that sense, while some people may say, \u2018oh, as a woman, do you think there are barriers?\u2019 But I only canvassed for women, so I never knew any different,\u201d she reflects.Obviously, family was foundational to Farrell\u2019s politicisation. Yet, in spite of the republican movement\u2019s deep affinity with her late aunt and namesake \u2013 who contested the 1981 general election in Cork North Central \u2013 the Galway West TD does not feel any weight of historic legacy. \u201cIt never crosses my mind until someone says it to me, to be perfectly honest,\u201d she remarks.Simultaneously, while joining Sinn F\u00e9in was a long-held aspiration for Farrell, none of her family were involved with the party. \u201cI always wanted to join Sinn F\u00e9in for a long time, even from when I was 14 or 15,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cBut my mother said: \u2018Wait until you go to college.\u2019 She was right \u2013 rather than joining in Leaving Cert year. So that is what I did. I joined the summer before college.\u201d\u201cThere is something fundamentally wrong with the way this society is working, and we need to have change that will help people\u2026\u201d Mair\u00e9ad Farrell TDIdeologyExplaining her rationale for choosing to join Sinn F\u00e9in, Farrell recalls the context of the international financial crash and the intensification of its impact on Ireland from 2008 onwards. \u201cWe were going in to finish our Leaving Cert and there was no certainty as to what they were going to do next in terms of college and unemployment,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cThe economics of Sinn F\u00e9in interested me.\u201d In addition to this, her self-identification as \u201ca united Irelander\u201d also aligns with the Sinn F\u00e9in ideology which she determines to be \u201cleft republican\u201d.However, in policy positions anathema to left politics, Sinn F\u00e9in opposes both the Local Property Tax and supported the retention of a 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax. Addressing what could therefore be interpreted as an ideological drift to the centre, Farrell betrays a hint of irritation. \u201cOn the Local Property Tax \u2013 and I am sick of saying this \u2013 there are people who find it very difficult to pay [it]. I meet them when I am canvassing, or they come to me to tell me. The majority of left-wing parties in this state are against this tax. In relation to corporation tax, that is totally out of our hands now. There is an OECD agreement, so we will see how that goes.\u201dInformed by experiences from her weekly constituency clinic and by the harsh socioeconomic challenges faced by some of her constituents she asserts: \u201cThere is something fundamentally wrong with the way this society is working, and we need to have change that will help people\u2026 That is why I am here, doing what I am doing, because I fundamentally believe that Sinn F\u00e9in will deliver that change.\u201d\u00d3graMoving to consider the virtues of political youth wings, Farrell explains that while she had already party membership, it was through a college friendship with Caoimhe Sloan \u2013 now a member of the Sinn F\u00e9in ard chomhairle \u2013 that she was introduced to \u00d3gra Shinn F\u00e9in. \u201cIt was the best time ever because it was such craic, you were meeting loads of people your own age who were interested in politics as well,\u201d she says.\u201cYou learn a lot. You learn how to organise meetings and campaigns. [\u00d3gra Shinn F\u00e9in] tries to give people opportunities; with public speaking and all that sort of thing\u2026 You get that level of training in a sense, although it is not formally training, it just happens organically.\u201dAsserting that the D\u00e1il must be \u201cyoung, old, male, female, and as representative of society as possible\u201d, Farrell rejects platitudes about young women in politics as banal.\u201cOne thing that I find is that people often say: \u2018Oh, it is great to have young women.\u2019 That annoys me because no, it is great to have women of all ages. It is nearly like, let\u2019s have young women because they are not as argumentative or whatever,\u201d she muses.D\u00e1il experienceIn 2014, Farrell received her first taste of electoral politics when, at the age of 24, she was elected as the youngest member of Galway City Council. Indicating that she had not expected to be elected along with party colleagues Anna Marley and Cathal \u00d3 Conchuir, Farrell was subsequently selected as the party\u2019s group leader. However, in a performance that epitomised Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s electoral fortunes across the State in 2019, all three Sinn F\u00e9in councillors failed to retain their seats in the Galway City Council election. Indeed, in Galway City East, Farrell attained 522 first preference votes on a quota of 1,059 and did not get across the line on transfers.However, in a dramatic turnaround a mere 10 months later, Sinn F\u00e9in would shrug off this reversal with an unprecedented showing in the February 2020 general election. In Galway West, Farrell achieved 8,464 first preference votes (14 per cent), just 58 votes behind constituency poll-topper \u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv TD and 2,709 more than compared with former party colleague Trevor \u00d3 Clochartaigh\u2019s tally in 2016.\u201cIt is important for us to be the voice of the people that feel that they are voiceless.\u201d\u201cIt was absolutely terrifying,\u201d Farrell laughs, adding: \u201cI did not expect to get elected.\u201d This is typified by the fact that she had taken unpaid leave from her finance job to contest the election rather than utilising annual leave \u201cbecause I assumed I would be straight back into the job\u201d.Reflecting on her initial experience, the Sinn F\u00e9in TD explains that she has \u201cbeen really enjoying it\u201d, while adopting an almost stoic attitude about the often-fleeting nature of political careers. \u201cHaving lost the council seat, I feel like this is all a moment in time. So, while it is stressful and while you work long hours, you may as well enjoy it because at some point it is going to be over and you are going to look back and be like, \u2018that was a cool experience\u2019. At some point, it will end,\u201d she believes.With no direct experience of the mechanics of Houses of the Oireachtas, Farrell experienced a steep learning curve and pays tribute to party colleagues Eoin \u00d3 Broin TD and Pearse Doherty TD who \u201chelped me learn\u201d.\u201cThere are always things that are a bit terrifying to do, but you just have to hide it and keep going,\u201d she concedes. At the same time, the first-time TD was buoyed by her time spent within the Sinn F\u00e9in apparatus and the personal relationships developed over some 14 years.PrioritiesAgain, praising Sinn F\u00e9in Spokesperson for Finance, Pearse Doherty TD, and his office for assisting Farrell upon her appointment to the Sinn F\u00e9in front bench, the Galway native indicates that her party\u2019s alternative budget and pursuit of \u201ctransparency\u201d have dominated her priorities as Spokesperson for Public Expenditure and Reform. \u201cWe had, for example, the issues with lobbying and we produced the Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020. In terms of freedom of information, we produced the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2021,\u201d she summarises.\u201cFor whistle-blowers, for transposing the EU Whistleblowing Directive, we produced the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2022 as well. On that particular one, we worked extremely well with the committee and with the Minister. Some of the things we had suggested were included in the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Act 2022. I enjoyed that, that we could actually see something tangible and bring that in as well. We would have gone further on certain things, but we can all work together to try to get something through.\u201dResponding to the hypothetical scenario of becoming DPER minister tomorrow, the Sinn F\u00e9in TD asserts that her first initiative would be to work to enact the Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020. \u201cPeople have completely lost faith in the political system and public life because they see the revolving door between politics and vested interests. That has really eroded people\u2019s confidence. There should never be a situation whereby people have better access to certain decision-makers or power than other people,\u201d she emphasises.Budget 2023Critiquing the triparty Government\u2019s Budget 2023, Farrell determines that \u201cthere was nothing for young people\u201d. \u201cUnless you earn \u20ac40,000 \u2013 and most people my age in Galway do not \u2013 there was nothing there. We know that so many people in their 20s that are looking to emigrate, and I just do not know if there was anything [in Budget 2023] for them to stay. I think that was deeply disappointing,\u201d she qualifies.Assessing that \u201ca lot of people are feeling very let down\u201d by the Budget, particularly given that increases to the social welfare rates will not take effect until January 2023, Farrell takes exception: \u201cIf you think there is an emergency and these people need help, why in the name of god would not just do it now? That is something that we would have proposed.\u201cWe also proposed changes in terms of the USC so that the tax package would benefit those low- and middle-income households, rather than just the 30 per cent of workers. [The Government] had such a massive tax package but its biggest proposals were for the higher earners.\u201dGalway WestSimultaneously, Farrell\u2019s passion for her constituency is apparent. \u201cI have the best constituency. There is no question,\u201d she insists, adding, \u201cI have Galway city, Conamara, and four islands; who can compete with that?\u201dAs a Gaeilgeoir, Farrell enjoys a warm working relationship with fellow Irish speakers and Galway West deputies Catherine Connolly TD and \u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv TD, particularly in relation to representing Conamara.Similar to other first-time Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la elected in 2020, Farrell\u2019s constituency work was hindered by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThere was not the same opportunity go and meet groups. It was not like [civil society] groups were having openings and events and they would invite you out,\u201d she explains.Instead, Sinn F\u00e9in split the Galway West constituency into 24 different units, researching local organisations with which to engage. Each Friday then, Farrell travels to a different location within one of these units and holds a clinic. \u201cWhen you get elected, you do not want to be listening to Galway Bay FM news and thinking, \u2018Oh, I did not know there was an issue in that place\u2019, you want the people to have told you and that you have that relationship, so that you are actually representing the people. Now I feel like I can represent the area better because I know what is going on,\u201d she affirms.AmbitionsWith the party attracting consistently high percentages in successive opinion polls since February 2020, Farrell believes that the challenge for Sinn F\u00e9in \u201cis about continuing to work away and hold government to account \u2013 that is what we are there for \u2013 and at the same time, to be constructive\u201d. Again, she reiterates her party\u2019s contribution to the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Act 2022. Simultaneously, however, she maintains that \u201cit is important for us to be the voice of the people that feel that they are voiceless\u201d.From an individual perspective, the Galway West TD insists that she holds no personal ambition. \u201cIt has never been about that for me. As I said, I see this as a moment in time so I will be here for as long as I can be. If people think someone else would be better, then that is what it is. It is a brilliant opportunity and I try my best to bring people\u2019s experiences into the D\u00e1il,\u201d she concludes.TagsIssue 55January 2023Show MoreShareFacebookXLinkedInWhatsAppShare via EmailCheck AlsoClosePublic AffairsEuropean elections 2024: What to expectFebruary 2024AnalysisGovernment misses waiting list reduction targetAnalysis,IssuesHousing 2022 reflections  Overall housing target on track but crisis aboundsAnalysis,IssuesGalway City: The beating heart of the westAnalysis,Regional focus: Galway City CouncilThe cost-of-living budgetAnalysis,IssuesCategoriesCategoriesSelect Category100 years of policing reportAgribusiness magazineAgriculture Food and DrinkAnalysisBanking & FinanceBrexitBusinessClimate COP26 reportConnectivity and future of workConnectivity reportCover StoryCybersecurity reportData protection reportDelivering cost rental housing reportDigitalDigital government reportDigital government reportEconomyEducationEnergy & EnvironmentEnergyEnvironmentRetrofiteolasEurope and BrexitFeaturedFintech ReportFuture of policing reportFuture of rail reportFuture of work and connectivity reportHealth and care servicesHousingInfrastructureRoad safetyInfrastructure and construction reportIssuesJusticeLocal GovernmentLocal government reportMol an \u00f3igePeoplePoliticsPublic AffairsReformRegional focus: Galway City CouncilRegional focus: Leitrim County CouncilReportsArtificial intelligence reportInfrastructure and construction reportRetrofitting reportRound table discussion: Cyber-resilience in an age of ransomwareRound table discussion: Digital transformation of public servicesRound table discussion: Driving electric vehicle adoption in IrelandRound table discussion: Evolution or revolution?
