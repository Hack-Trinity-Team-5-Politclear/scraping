Photo Conor Foley.Stephen Fernane\u00a9KerrymanTue 13 Feb 2024 at 15:36Tralee native Paul Daly has been chosen to run alongside sitting candidates Cllr Deirdre Ferris and Cllr Cathal Foley in the Tralee MD elections this summer.Paul is a primary school teacher at Caherleaheen National School in Tralee since 2002, and is a brother to sitting Sinn F\u00e9in TD Pa Daly. Members of Sinn F\u00e9in selected the three candidates at a party event on Monday evening.Paul is a member of the Tralee Dynamos Football Club and Na Gaeil GAA Club for many years. But his focus in the immediate future will be on local politics and getting elected to Kerry County Council.\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to be selected by the local cumann and to represent Sinn F\u00e9in in the local elections. I just hope I can do them proud,\u201d Paul said.\u201cI\u2019m a teacher and you get a very good feel for the struggles that people are going through, and the issues that are out there\u2026I believe that every school in town is under funded and that\u2019s something that needs to change. I\u2019ve been involved in local sporting clubs, and I feel that facilities can be improved, generally, for children to play in and participate in events properly,\u201d he added.Paul insists that health and housing are major issues he will work on if elected.\u201cI don\u2019t know how some people are able to cope with rents and waiting times for medical procedures. We\u2019ve had the same parties in power for decades and the problem is going from bad to worse. Sinn F\u00e9in believes it can deliver on these issues,\u201d he said.\"I will be getting out there in the next few weeks to get to know people. There is an appetite for change and we need to get the message across that Sinn F\u00e9in is the right party to make that change,\u201d Paul said.A party spokesperson for Sinn F\u00e9in said a decision on whether to add a fourth candidate for the Tralee area will be made in the coming weeks.Related topicsStephen FernaneMore Kerry NewsGAAKerry name unchanged side to face Dublin in Croke Park
