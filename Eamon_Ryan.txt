Our politics is working with the opposition as well as governments. We don't want to get into derogatory wars online, or one-upmanship, old-school politics. The politics we need today is the politics of collaboration.We need to look at real solutions to the problems that we face and work constructively to bring about the change we need. Our motto is \u201cthink globally, act locally\u201d inspired by a belief that looking after nature goes hand in hand with looking after each other.It has to start with a long-term vision for our city. I stand for a Dublin that is designed around people and the environment.I stand for a Dublin where good education and skilled work are available for those that seek it, where people can afford to rent or buy a house, where access to an efficient and reliable public transport system is guaranteed and where cycling and walking are also a viable and healthy option for people getting in and out of the city centre.My prioritiesThe next ten years are critical if we are to address the climate and biodiversity crisis which threatens our safe future on this planet. We believe that Ireland can rise to this challenge, and that in doing so we will be able to improve the health, welfare, and the security of all our people.We are committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade) and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The 2050 target will be set in law by the Climate Action Bill, alongside a newly established Climate Action Council. The Bill will define how five-year carbon budgets will be set. Every sector will contribute to meeting this target by implementing policy changes.We are committed to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland. Necessary improvements in climate impact, quality of life, air quality and physical and mental health demand that every effort is made by the Government to make active travel and public transport better and more accessible.Cycling and electric cycling have enormous potential to facilitate a high proportion of daily trips, if we provide an environment which protects and prioritises this mode of transport. We will promote cycling and pedestrian safety and enable this through improved design, increased separation and better signage and marking.\"ExperienceI was born in Dublin and raised in Dundrum and Dartry. I studied commerce in UCD before taking a job managing a marketing course in the university\u2019s School of Business. I went on to found a cycling tourism company, Irish Cycling Safaris, in the late 1980s and in 1996 won the Ernst & Young Tourism Enterprise Award. The business still trades successfully as Cycling Safaris. I was the founding chairperson of the Dublin Cycling Campaign and began my political career as a Dublin City Councillor for the Rathgar \u2013 Rathmines ward. I then went on to serve both as a TD for Dublin Bay South and as a Government Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. In recent years, I worked for aEuropean climate organisationand chaired the digital policy group in theInstitute of International and European Affairs.Connecteamon.ryan@oireachtas.ie016183898http://www.eamonryan.ieTwitterFacebookInstagramLatest NewsView all NewsPress releaseGreens support long-overdue Metrolink19th February 2024Press releaseIsrael must pay to rebuild Gaza15th February 2024View all NewsAboutImpactCampaignsOur PeopleTake ActionPoliciesNews & EventsJob Opportunities and InternshipsLocal GroupsContact UsData Protection and PrivacyCookiesAccessibilityFollow us onInstagram linkFacebook linkTwitter linkYouTube linkA member of the European Green Party and the Global GreensCloseAbout UsMission & PrinciplesOur HistoryLocal GroupsAffiliate GroupsJob Opportunities and InternshipsImpactCampaignsPoliciesOur PeopleTake ActionNewsContact UsGaeilgeMember loginJoinDonateCloseSearch\nEamon Ryan - WikipediaJump to contentMain menuMain menumove to sidebarhideNavigationMain pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonateContributeHelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileLanguagesLanguage links are at the top of the page.SearchSearchCreate accountLog inPersonal toolsCreate accountLog inPages for logged out editorslearn moreContributionsTalkContentsmove to sidebarhide(Top)1Early and personal life2Political careerToggle Political career subsection2.1Government: 2007\u201320112.2Green Party leader in opposition: 2011\u201320202.3Government: 2020\u2013present3References4External linksToggle the table of contentsEamon Ryan8 languagesDeutschFran\u00e7aisGaeilge\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4Norsk bokm\u00e5lPolskiScots\u4e2d\u6587Edit linksArticleTalkEnglishReadEditView historyToolsToolsmove to sidebarhideActionsReadEditView historyGeneralWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPage informationCite this pageGet shortened URLDownload QR codeWikidata itemPrint/exportDownload as PDFPrintable versionIn other projectsWikimedia CommonsFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaIrish Green Party politician (b. 1963)For the footballer, see\u00c9amonn Ryan.Eamon RyanTDMinister for the Environment, Climate and CommunicationsIncumbentAssumed office27 June 2020TaoiseachMiche\u00e1l MartinLeo VaradkarPreceded byRichard BrutonMinister for TransportIncumbentAssumed office27 June 2020TaoiseachMiche\u00e1l MartinLeo VaradkarPreceded byShane RossLeader of the Green PartyIncumbentAssumed office27 May 2011DeputyCatherine MartinPreceded byJohn GormleyMinister for Communications, Energy and Natural ResourcesIn office14 June 2007\u00a0\u2013 23 January 2011TaoiseachBertie AhernBrian CowenPreceded byNoel DempseySucceeded byPat CareyTeachta D\u00e1laIncumbentAssumed officeFebruary 2016ConstituencyDublin Bay SouthIn officeMay 2002\u2013February 2011ConstituencyDublin SouthPersonal detailsBornEamon Michael Ryan(1963-07-28)28 July 1963(age\u00a060)Dundrum, Dublin, IrelandPolitical partyGreen PartySpouseVictoria White\u200b(m.1998)\u200bChildren4EducationGonzaga CollegeAlma materUniversity College DublinWebsiteeamonryan.ieEamon Michael Ryan(born 28 July 1963) is an IrishGreen Partypolitician who has served asMinister for the Environment, Climate and CommunicationsandMinister for Transportsince June 2020 andLeader of the Green Partysince May 2011.

He previously served asMinister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resourcesfrom 2007 to 2011.[1][2]Early and personal life[edit]Ryan was born inDublinin 1963 and raised inDundrum, where he continues to live with his family. He was educated atGonzaga CollegeandUniversity College Dublin, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He was manager of the UCD Marketing Development Programme from 1985 to 1986, and following three years of emigration and unemployment in 1989, he founded Cycling Safaris, a company which organises cycling holidays inIrelandandEurope.[3]He married the author and journalist Victoria White in 1998 and they have four children.[4][5]Political career[edit]He first held political office in 1998, when he was co-opted toDublin City Council, taking up the seat previously held byJohn Gormley.[5]He topped the poll at the1999 local electionsin theRathmineslocal electoral area. From 1995 to 2002, he served on the advisory committee of the Dublin Transport Office. At the2002 general election, he was first elected toD\u00e1il \u00c9ireannas aGreen PartyTD for theDublin Southconstituency.[6]He served as Green Party Spokesperson for Transport, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources during the29th D\u00e1il.In 2003, Ryan protested the use ofShannon Airportby the U.S. military for transport of combatants and arms, in violation of Ireland's neutrality.[7]He announced on 13 September 2004, that he intended to seek his party's nomination to be a candidate in the2004 presidential election. However, when it was announced that the incumbent,Mary McAleese, was seeking a second term he withdrew. His campaign was also hit by his admission ofcannabisuse, an illegal drug.[8]Government: 2007\u20132011[edit]Ryan in 2007He was re-elected to the D\u00e1il at the2007 general electionheld on 24 May. On 13 June, the Green Party voted in favour of entering into a coalition government withFianna F\u00e1iland theProgressive Democratsat a special party convention. Ryan was appointed to the cabinet byTaoiseachBertie Ahern, asMinister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resourceswhen the30th D\u00e1ilsat the following day.As Minister, he stated his priorities would be to improve upon the changes underway in the Irish energy sector, with strong emphasis on aiding the adaptation ofrenewablesandbuilding retrofitting. He also aimed to enhance communications infrastructure where Ireland had fallen behind other countries. During his period in office, installedwindcapacity in Ireland doubled, and by 2010 the average daily energy derived fromrenewablesources (as a percentage of total demand) had increased to 17%, peaking at 42%.[9][10][11]He also committed Ireland to theEuropean Super Gridprogramme in 2009 and announced major government investment inmarine energyresearch projects.[12]Government schemes were expanded for home energy retrofitting as uptake increased,[13]the National Broadband Scheme was completed,[14]a Broadband for Schools Scheme launched,[15]and a nationalelectric vehicleand chargepoint initiative was announced in conjunction with theESB Electric IrelandandPeugeot Citro\u00ebn, which was subsequently implemented by the new government.[16][17]In response to theCorrib gas controversy, the environmental activist organisationShell to Seaand its spokespersonMaura Harrington, criticised Ryan for joining Fianna F\u00e1il in coalition as the terms of the programme for government did not include a reversal or renegotiation of the proposed gas pipeline and refinery atBroadhaven Bay,County Mayo.[18][19]Before entering into government, Ryan supported the aims of the Shell to Sea campaign and attended their protests.[20]Ryan was also criticised by Shell to Sea for failing to launch an independent review of the decision, as stipulated by the Green Party in a motion passed at their annual convention in 2007.[21][22]Ryan resigned as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on 23 January 2011, when the Green Party withdrew from government.[23]The following day he helped broker an agreement withFine Gaeland theLabour Partywhich ensured the passing of the 2011 Finance bill, prior to the holding of thegeneral electionon the 25 February 2011. He lost his seat at election, receiving 6.8% of the vote.[24]As part of his pension Ryan will receive a lump sum of \u20ac110,000 and an annual pension of \u20ac51,000 when he is 65, in 2028.[25][26][27]Green Party leader in opposition: 2011\u20132020[edit]He was one of three candidates to contest the subsequent Green Party leadership election of May 2011. He was elected leader on 27 May 2011, succeedingJohn Gormley.[28]The party had no representation in the Oireachtas when he became leader.In 2012, he became an associate with E3G working on an assessment of the development potential of the North Seas Offshore Grid Initiative in a project which was supported by theEuropean Climate Foundationand the Children's Investment Fund Foundation. In 2013, he organised two climate gatherings which brought international climate experts to Ireland to examine what new narratives are needed to increase public support for action on the climate issue.He was the Green Party candidate in theDublinconstituency at the2014 European Parliament election, but was not elected. He was elected a TD for theDublin Bay Southconstituency in the2016 general election, alongside deputy leaderCatherine Martinwho secured a seat inDublin Rathdown. The Greens' return to the D\u00e1il following their wipeout in 2011 was the first time in Irish election history that a political party had been able to survive losing all their TDs.[29]In 2019, Ryan called for wolves to be reintroduced to Ireland.[30]Fine Gael rejected this suggestion, withMinister for Culture, Heritage and the GaeltachtJosepha Madiganresponding that her department had no plans to reintroduce wolves into the country, saying that the\"large predator\"doing so would do damage to farming.[31]He reiterated the following January that he would like to see them introduced in his lifetime.[32]Also in 2019, comments he made on car use in rural Ireland which were published in an article byThe Irish Timeswas criticised online. The newspaper also stated that Ryan suggested that a village of 300 people needs just 30 cars to operate. In the article, Ryan stated people could walk to a pick-up point or cycle. Responding to the article, the party took issue with the headline, and in a statement said the original headline (\"You don't need to own a car to live in rural Ireland\"- Green Party T.D') had caused\u201ca flood of online fury \u2013 and rightly so, because a suggestion like that would be ridiculous and impractical\u201d.[33]In February 2020, the Green Party had its best election result in thegeneral election of that year, with the party increasing its representation in the D\u00e1il to 12 TDs.[34]Ryan was re-elected in theDublin Bay Southconstituency, topping the poll with 22.4% of the first-preference votes.[35][36]In March 2020, in a speech in a debate on responses to theCOVID-19 pandemic crisis, he made comments on growing food in the event of a supply crisis that went viral online, saying, \"we'll have our salads ready to go!\"[37]In June 2020, he was criticised online, particularly by Green Party councillors, for his use of the phrase \"you nigger\" when quoting director Sean Gallen on his experiences of racism.[38]Gallen himself said that Ryan's intentions were \"really good\" as he tried \"to bring up this big issue of racism within an Irish context\".[39]Ryan publicly apologised the same day as the speech.[40]Government: 2020\u2013present[edit]On 27 June 2020, following 139 days of negotiations, the members of Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael and the Green Party all voted in favour of entering government together as a coalition.[41][42]There had been concern that the proposal would not be accepted by the Green members, as the proposal required that it pass with 66% of the members in favour it.[43]However, in the end 76% of the Green Party membership voted in favour of the deal.[41]The Irish Timesjournalist Pat Leahy described the vote to enter government as \"vindication\" for Ryan's leadership of the party and suggested it would strengthen his hand in the subsequent Green Party leadership contest.[44]Green Party rules require a leadership election within 6 months of a general election in Ireland.[45]Ryan sought re-election, and Deputy LeaderCatherine Martinalso contested the position, leading to the2020 Green Party leadership election.[46]Ryan was considered to represent the moderate \"Old Guard\" who were in favour of entering government while Martin was considered to represent younger, more radical Green party members apprehensive about working with Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael.[44]On entering the government, Ryan was appointed asMinister for the Environment, Climate and CommunicationsandMinister for Transport.[47]On 23 July 2020, Ryan was re-elected as Green Party leader, defeating deputy leaderCatherine Martinby 994 votes (51.24%) to 946 (48.76%).[48]In June 2021, Ryan received the Green Leader Award.[49]On 6 November 2021, Ryan cancelled his trip to theCOP26conference in Glasgow after testing positive forCOVID-19.[50][51]The next day, it was confirmed that he tested negative after taking a second test and would now travel to COP26.[52]On 19 December, Ryan began self-isolating after testing positive for COVID-19.[53]On 13 June 2022, Ryan tested positive for COVID-19 a second time.[54]On 17 December 2022, he was re-appointed to the same positions following Leo Varadkar's appointment as Taoiseach.[55]References[edit]^\"Eamon Ryan\".Oireachtas Members Database.Archivedfrom the original on 12 February 2019.

I have been a TD for Dublin Bay South since 2016 and have been leader of the Green Party/Comhaontas Glas (www.greenparty.ie) since 2011.I was born in Dublin and studied commerce in UCD before taking a job managing a marketing course in the university\u2019s School of Business. I went on to establish a cycling tourism company, Irish Cycling Safaris, in the late 1980s and in 1996 won the Ernst & Young Tourism Enterprise Award. The business still trades successfully.I was the founding chairperson of the Dublin Cycling Campaign and began my political career as a Dublin City Councillor for the Rathgar \u2013 Rathmines ward. I then went on to serve as a TD for Dublin South for nine years and as a Government Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources from 2007 to 2011. \u00a0Professionally, I have worked for a European climate organisation (www.e3g.org) and chaired the digital policy group in the Institute of International and European Affairs (www.iiea.com).about eamonI am Minister for both the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Transport \u2013 two key departments at the centre of Ireland\u2019s climate transformation.Since my re-election and appointment as Senior Minister and Government leader in Ireland\u2019s three-party coalition I have led the enactment of Ireland\u2019s world recognised Climate Act 2021, which sets binding targets to reduce emissions by 51% by 2030 and to move to net zero by 2050.I have provided huge support for Ireland\u2019s on-shore wind programme, which is already recognised as a world leader, have put in place the conditions to ensure huge advances in solar power and have kickstarted Ireland\u2019s off-shore wind programme, which has enormous potential to not just power the country but produce hydrogen and provide vital energy to Europe and the UK.In response to the energy crisis caused primarily by the war in Ukraine, my Department (Environment, Climate and Communications) developed the electricity credits which have gone to over 2.1 million households to help support them with higher energy bills over successive winters.I was the first Minister in 75 years to reduce transport costs with cuts of 20% for all adults and 50% for young people from 18 to 25. I\u2019m working hard to oversee the greatest transformation in Ireland\u2019s public transport services in decades. Across rural Ireland there is now one new or enhanced bus service being rolled out every week. In our cities, I\u2019m working hard to see the progression of the new Metrolink from Swords to the City Centre and plans for extended Dart services in Dublin, a new Metropolitan Rail Service in Cork and transformative metropolitan transport plans for Galway, Limerick and Waterford.Over the last two years I have become more involved in international climate leadership (link to international). I was appointed as a lead EU negotiator at the last two COPs, leading negotiations on loss and damage at COP27 in Sharm-El-Sheik and on climate finance more broadly at COP27 in Dubai. I co-chaired the North Seas Energy Co-operation, along with the European Commission, in 2022, working to ensure an EU-wide agreement on the development of off-shore wind. This year, I look forward to co-chairing the International Energy Agency\u2019s Ministerial, which will set out the strategy and ambitions of the global body for the next two years.Eamon Ryan\nEamon Ryan -
