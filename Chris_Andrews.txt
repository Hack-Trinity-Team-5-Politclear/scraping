His fatherNiall Andrewsand his uncleDavid Andrewsboth served as Fianna F\u00e1il TDs, while his first cousinBarry Andrewswas elected a Fianna F\u00e1il TD at the2002 general electionand is now anMEP. He was the fourth member of his family to have sat in theD\u00e1il.

Andrews is married with two daughters.Andrews graduated fromMaynooth Universitywith a degree in community and youth work.[3]Political career[edit]In May 2007, Andrews topped the poll in theDublin South-Eastconstituency, on his second attempt, gaining 6,600 first preferences. He was a member ofDublin City Councilfrom 1999 to 2004, 2006 to 2007 and 2014 to 2020.[4]He was convenor of theOireachtasFinance Committee, and was a member of the Trade, Enterprise and Employment Committee and the European Scrutiny Committee in the30th D\u00e1il.Andrews in 2014Support for Palestine[edit]During the2008\u20132009 Israel\u2013Gaza conflicthe called for an economic, diplomatic and politicalboycottofIsrael, for its ambassador to Ireland to be expelled, and for shops to remove \"settler produce\" from Israel. He said that Israel had the right to defend itself, but that its disproportionate response meant that \"...it can only now be classified as a terror state\".[5]He later told a Russian reporter that there was no electricity in Gaza throughout his time there.[6]On 30 May 2010, he was one of three Irish politicians who were prevented from leavingCyprusby authorities to join an international flotilla carrying aid to the blockaded Gaza Strip.[7]In March 2011, Andrewsset offonanother flotilla to Gaza.

In August 2012, Andrews left the Fianna F\u00e1il party. He said that he was disillusioned with the lack of direction the party was taking after it was revealed he had been using aTwitteraccount to anonymously attack party leaderMiche\u00e1l Martinand other senior members, including a constituency rival, CouncillorJim O'Callaghan. Andrews stated that his decision to quit the party was not related to the Twitter account even though his resignation followed two days after he had been confronted about his online trolling activity and cyberbullying of party colleagues.[10]As a member of Sinn F\u00e9in[edit]In September 2013, he joinedSinn F\u00e9inand successfully contested the2014 local electionsfor the Pembroke South Dock local electoral area of Dublin City Council for the party.[11]In February 2015, he was selected to contest the new constituency ofDublin Bay Southat the2016 general election;[12]however, he failed to be elected.He was the Sinn F\u00e9in candidate for the Dublin Bay South constituency at the2020 general electionand was elected.[13]Daniel Ceitinn was co-opted to Andrews' seat on Dublin City Council following his election to the D\u00e1il.[14]In December 2020, Andrews apologised for liking tweets aboutLaurel Hubbardthat were perceived as transphobic by transgender rights campaigners. The tweet criticised transgender women participating in female sports.[15]See also[edit]Families in the OireachtasReferences[edit]^\"Chris Andrews\".Houses of the Oireachtas.

Photograph: Dara Mac D\u00f3naill/The Irish TimesColm KeenaTue Nov  7 2023 - 17:48The Sinn F\u00e9in TD for Dublin Bay South, Chris Andrews, has lodged defamation proceedings in the High Court against The Irish Times and its political correspondent, Harry McGee.The politician is understood to be claiming that he was defamed in an article written by McGee and published in The Irish Times concerning the Sinn F\u00e9in response to the Hamas attack on Israel.Among the matters covered in the article were comments by Mr Andrews on social media about the events in Israel which included his responses to a tweet from the President of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.Last year, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, T\u00e1naiste Miche\u00e1l Martin,  Minister for Justice Helen McEntee, and  Minister for Expenditure and Public Reform Paschal Donohoe all criticised Sinn F\u00e9in, saying threats of legal action and legal actions taken by members of the party against politicians and the media were having a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on Irish democracy.READ MOREMost things you\u2019ve heard about eating meat are wrong, say Irish scientistsDavid McWilliams: Is it any wonder that Ireland\u2019s public transport is among the worst in Europe?From Maltesers to lucky underpants - the superstitious piseogs entrenched in Kerry football\u2018I  hate this job\u2019: What makes Keir Starmer tick?In response, a spokesman for the party said the cases were taken by people who had \u201cno option but to vindicate their good name in the face of false accusations made by others\u201d.\u201cThe right to vindicate one\u2019s good name has no impact on the cut-and-thrust of political debate, as can be seen in the D\u00e1il, in council chambers, and in media debates on a daily basis,\u201d he said.Last year, the party leader Mary Lou McDonald issued defamation proceedings against RT\u00c9 over an item on radio about Government politicians being excluded from speaking at a rally organised by the National Women\u2019s Council.Colm KeenaColm Keena is an Irish Times journalist.

Since then, Israel has declared war and has been carrying out strikes on Gaza in response, killing more than 10,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen issued a statement on social media saying: \u201cI unequivocally condemn the attack carried out by Hamas terrorists against Israel. It is terrorism in its most despicable form. Israel has the right to defend itself against such heinous attacks.\u201dThe next day, Mr Andrews responded to that statement with his own comment on the social media site X, formerly Twitter: \u201cIt seems that according to the #EU and #Ireland only Palestine has no right to defend itself against murder, torture and Apartheid\u2026#Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #gaza.\u201dHis comment was accompanied by a photo of an explosion, which appears to be caused by an Israeli rocket fired at a building in Gaza.We need your consent to load this Social Media content. We use a number of different Social Media outlets to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.Please review your details and accept them to load the contentMr Andrews is now taking a case over the coverage of his statement inThe Irish Timesin an article a week later.The Sinn F\u00e9in TD is represented by Dublin solicitors Sheridan Fitzgerald. The solicitors confirmed the case related to tweets in response to Ms von der Leyen. Mr Andrews\u2019 legal representatives issued a solicitor\u2019s letter toThe Irish Timesfollowing publication of the story.A summons was issued by Mr Andrews against The Irish Times Designated Activity Company yesterday. Mr Andrews is also suingThe Irish Timespolitical correspondent Harry McGee.Mr Andrews and Sinn F\u00e9in have not responded to requests for comment.The Irish Timesis understood to be planning to vigorously defend the legal action.Mr Andrews has served as a Sinn F\u00e9in TD the 2020 general election. He is currently the party\u2019s spokesperson on sport. Previously, he was a Fianna F\u00e1il TD from 2007 to 2011.His family has a strong Fianna F\u00e1il tradition. His late father, Niall Andrews, was a Fianna F\u00e1il TD and MEP. His uncle David Andrews was a Fianna F\u00e1il TD and foreign affairs minister during the Good Friday Agreement negotiations.Niall and David\u2019s father, Todd Andrews, was a prominent republican in the War of Independence and Civil War was also involved in Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s early days, although he never ran for office. He was a former chairman of RT\u00c9 and CIE and was also the first managing director of Bord na M\u00f3na.Fianna F\u00e1il MEP Barry Andrews is a cousin of Chris Andrews, as are formerLate Late Showpresenter Ryan Tubridy and comedian David McSavage.Chris Andrews is a member of the Oireachtas Media Committee, but has recused himself from meeting on RT\u00c9\u2019s payments scandal, due to his relationship with Mr Tubridy.His relationship with Fianna F\u00e1il soured after he created a phantom Twitter account to criticise leader Miche\u00e1l Martin and other senior figures sometime after losing his seat in 2011.Mr Andrews was unveiled as the phantom tweeter by Eddy Carroll, the husband of senior party figure Kathryn Byrne. He had sent over 300 tweets which were highly critical of a number of figures within Fianna F\u00e1il. Mr Carroll used photo and video surveillance to unmask Mr Andrews, who went to ground afterwards.He joined Sinn F\u00e9in in 2013, before running for the party in the 2014 local elections. His ties with Sinn F\u00e9in arose from his involvement in campaigning for Palestine.
