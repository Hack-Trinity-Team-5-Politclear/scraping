Hildegarde Naughton	53	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2024-02-21	dail	33	Healthcare Provision in Rural Communities: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I also begin by adding my condolences to those of others to Deputy Michael Collins on the loss of his nephew. I thank Members of the House for their contributions to this discussion on general practice in rural communities and for their interest in and commitment to the issue. I acknowledge the issues various Members raised, such as the delays patients are facing in getting appointments with GPs and some GP practices not currently accepting new patients. The Government has substantially increased investment in general practice in recent years in an effort to increase GP capacity. Expenditure on fees and other supports paid to GPs has increased by 41% since 2019, with expenditure in 2023 expected to exceed €800 million. These fees and supports include a 10% increase to rural practice supports, improved GP maternity and paternity leave, and enhanced capitation rates. It also includes increases in payments for the provision of contraception services under the GMS, €2 million to support GP out-of-hours services, and a further €30 million in additional capacity supports to assist GPs in retaining staff and recruiting additional staff to meet patient demand. These measures are making general practice an attractive option for medical graduates, as can be seen in the record levels of applications to enter GP training in 2024 and the decreasing number of GP training graduates who now intend to emigrate. It is acknowledged, however, that the provision of GP services in some rural areas is more challenging than in others. The pattern of work in general practice is changing and there can be financial uncertainty in setting up a practice in a rural area as the size of the GMS panel available may be smaller. GPs increasingly favour a multiple-GP team model, with some GPs developing sub-specialisations such as in chronic disease management or women's health. While the overall anticipated increase in GP numbers is expected to help to address the challenges of service delivery overall, including in rural areas, it is accepted that some difficult to serve areas require additional supports to ensure access to general practice services in the community. To address this, the 2023 GP agreement included specific supports for rural practices. In addition to the 10% increase in rural practice supports, a ring-fenced fund of €600,000 is being made available to support the delivery of an initiative to support rural GPs to source locum cover for approved leave periods. The HSE is currently exploring how to implement this solution. The HSE is also in the process of implementing a programme to improve the sustainability of GP services in rural areas by working with a larger practice in a nearby town to take on a smaller practice as a satellite entity. It is hoped that, if successful, the programme could be rolled out elsewhere and help to ensure the ongoing provision of services in rural communities. These are examples of creative solutions which will make rural general practice more attractive to GPs. Increasing GP training places will increase GP capacity in the medium to long term, and the number of GPs entering training has more than doubled, from 120 in 2009 to 286 in 2023, with a further increase to 350 places planned for this year.While there may be some concern that the planned retirements of some GPs will result in GP capacity issues, the replacement rate for retiring GPs is very encouraging for the future of general practice. Due to the increased number of GP training places over the past several years, it is estimated that for every two GPs who currently retire, we now have three to six new GPs entering general practice. As regards more immediate measures to address rural GP capacity, the non-EU rural GP programme is already placing GPs in rural practices across the country with 121 non-EU GPs recruited by the end of January 2024, of which 84 were already in place in GP practices. The Government has provided funding to bring up to 250 more non-EU GPs to Ireland by the end of this year. The strategic review of general practice is under way and will identify the arrangements necessary to improve the current system of GP care as part of a primary care-focused health service and in line with the programme for Government and the Sláintecare vision of access. There has been considerable additional investment in oral healthcare services in recent years, including an expansion in 2022 of the care available under the dental treatment services scheme for adult medical card holders and substantial increases in fees paid to dentists. Sustained investment in recent years has reduced the number of children waiting to access public orthodontic care. The Government is committed to fundamentally reforming dental services. The HSE has appointed a strategic reform lead, who is driving service reform for adults and children in line with policy. The Government is committed to delivering the enhanced community care programme, which is designed to deliver the reorientation of service delivery towards general practice and community-based services, thereby providing health services closer to people's homes - the right care in the right place at the right time. Therefore, I support the Government's amendment to this motion, which agrees that the Government is committed to fundamentally reforming dental services, that increased investment is making general practice in urban and rural areas a more attractive career for medical graduates and that the initiatives taken by the Government to increase the number of training places and recruit non-EU GPs will result in an increase in the number of GPs providing services in urban and rural areas, in an increase in the ratio of GPs to population and in improved services for patients.	spk_49

Hildegarde Naughton	53	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2024-02-07	dail	33	Death of Former Taoiseach: Expressions of Sympathy	dbsect_3	I add my own on tribute to that of our former Taoiseach and party leader and to the deserved praise already given by my colleagues in the House today. I first of all extend my sympathies to John’s wife, Finola, his son, Matthew, and his daughters, Juliana, Emily and Mary-Elizabeth. I note in particular the presence on the benches today of his brother, Richard, someone who is held in such high esteem by our party. I extend to you, Richard, your sister and the rest of the family my sincere sympathies. While many words will have been written about John Bruton’s positive legacy, I want to particularly note comments made by the former British Prime Minister, Sir John Major, when he appeared before the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in January of last year. During the course of Sir John Major’s presentation, he noted his extraordinary luck in having John Bruton as his counterpart in bringing forward the framework agreement in 1995. It was a vital document, as already stated by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in which both Governments set themselves the aim of fostering agreement and reconciliation, leading to a new political framework founded on consent. This was, of course, the precursor to the Good Friday Agreement. It dealt with, among other issues, North-South institutions and a framework for accountable government in Northern Ireland, including an assembly. It is somewhat timely to remind ourselves of that, given the recent restoration of the assembly in Northern Ireland. I do not have time to list all of John Bruton’s work in advancing the peace process, work that has often been overlooked but should not be. He was a catalyst for change and an advocate for peace and for non-violence. In recent days, I have seen the hugely positive influence he has had on our shared island being recognised, and I hope that continues. Whatever else his achievements, and there were many, John Bruton helped to bring peace to this island. Not many can say that, and it is a legacy to be proud of.	spk_26
Hildegarde Naughton	53	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2024-01-31	dail	33	Misuse of Drugs (Cannabis Regulation) Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after ""That"" and substitute the following: ""Dáil Éireann resolves that the Misuse of Drugs (Cannabis Regulation) Bill 2022 be deemed to be read a second time this day nine months, so as to allow sufficient time for the report of the Citizens’ Assembly on Drugs to be considered by the Oireachtas."".I welcome the opportunity to update the Oireachtas with regard to drug policy and to highlight the progress made on implementing the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery. As we are all aware, the misuse of illicit drugs affects every part of society, whether urban or rural, disadvantaged or affluent.The misuse of drugs has devastating consequences for not only the individual grappling with addiction, but also for their families and the communities in which they live.  We are all aware of the consequences: poor health and mental health outcomes for people in addiction, families torn apart, profiteering by unscrupulous gangs from the misery of others and drug-related intimidation in communities. I appreciate there are many challenges, but as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I am committed to building on the progress already made. I have long held the view that we as a society have needed to have an open and honest conversation about drugs. Ensuring that the voices of those with lived experience and the voices of young people are heard is key to putting in place an appropriate response.  As the House is aware, last year the Government established the citizens' assembly to consider and make recommendations on the legislative, policy and operation changes the State could make to significantly reduce the harmful impact of illicit drugs on individuals, their families, communities and wider society. The report of the citizens' assembly was published last week and makes 36 recommendations, including that the State introduces a comprehensive health-led response to drugs. This is a landmark report to assist in the further development of policy on drug use in Ireland. Choosing to have a citizens’ assembly on drug use demonstrates the seriousness and gravity that the Government gives to this issue and its awareness of the impact of drugs on all corners and sections of society. It also began the open and honest conversation that has been so badly needed and which will continue now in the Oireachtas special committee. There is an onus now on the Government to consider the deliberations of the citizens' assembly in order that it can enhance the response to drug use from a policy, legislative and service delivery perspective. I am committed to leading on this response. I will actively engage with Government colleagues and Oireachtas Members on the response to this report. But as we can see from the assembly’s report, drug misuse is a complex issue. There are no easy or straightforward solutions. Clearly, we need more services to be provided and greater efforts must be made to prevent the use of drugs. That is why, in 2024, I am providing an additional €6 million for drug services to implement the national drugs strategy. This brings the total new spend on drug services to €11.75 million since 2023. I also last year launched the first national drug prevention and education programme, which will fund five demonstration projects in school, community and nighttime social settings. People grappling with addiction face different challenges. Some may have the support of family, others may not. Some may be in employment while others struggle to secure a job because of the nature of their illness. Access to education can also be an issue. The nature of addiction is different for each affected person. For example, there are people who not only have an addiction to drugs but who also struggle with their mental health. I have secured funding this year to help these people with a dual diagnosis, with a particular focus on younger people. While I have secured additional funding to provide more treatment episodes for those in need, we know there are gaps in service provision. That is why I have asked that an audit of services be completed in order that we can ensure services are available where they are most needed. Just because someone has received treatment does not mean they are in a position to lead a happy and productive life. That is why we are investing for the first time in recovery. The Government is committed to taking a health-led approach to the use of illicit drugs in line with the recommendations set out by the citizens’ assembly report. Nothing is served by jailing a person in addiction caught with drugs for personal use. That is why I am committed to introducing the health diversion programme, which will connect people suffering from problematic drug use with the health services they need and will provide a pathway to treatment and recovery. Harm reduction is a key component of the health-led approach to drug use. That is why people can submit drugs at festivals for testing as part of a range of harm reduction initiatives under the safer nightlife programme, thereby helping people to avoid particularly risky drugs. That is why a medically supervised injecting facility will open this year to provide a safe space for people to inject drugs. It is why the building and operation of the new 100-bed medical and addiction facility developed by the Dublin Simon Community is being funded by the Government. I thank Deputy Kenny for bringing forward the Private Members' Bill. I note that the Bill proposes to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act to enable a person who is at least 18 years of age to have possession for the person’s personal use of either or both cannabis and cannabis resin that in each case does not exceed a specified amount and to provide for related matters. It is important that this proposal should be considered in the context of recommendation No. 17 from the citizens’ assembly, which is that the State introduces a comprehensive health-led response to drugs. This recommendation assumes that possession of controlled drugs would remain illegal, while those found in possession of drugs for personal use could be afforded extensive opportunities to engage with health-led services. Depending on how the legislation is designed, this approach would minimise or potentially completely remove the possibility of criminal conviction and prison sentences for simple possession. The citizens’ assembly advises that there are several open questions about how Ireland might best legislate for a health-led model combining diversion, decriminalisation and dissuasion. Given the important legal and constitutional issues to be considered, it is the responsibility of the Oireachtas, informed by legal advice and detailed pre-legislative scrutiny, to determine the most appropriate legal mechanisms to achieve this goal. The recommendations of the citizens’ assembly will now be considered by the Oireachtas. It is anticipated that an Oireachtas special committee will be established to consider these recommendations and to agree on the most appropriate next steps. In this context, debating the Bill at this stage could undermine the work of an Oireachtas special committee. In light of the above, it is the Government’s view that this Bill is premature and should be deferred for a period of nine months. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle."	spk_23

Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-12-05	dail	33	Confidence in the Minister for Justice: Motion	dbsect_11	I support this motion of confidence in my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Helen McEntee. It is very easy for the Opposition to say that the Minister and the Garda should have known that a major public order incident was going to break out in Dublin city centre, but how could they? How could they foretell the malign intent of some people that led them to incite a riot, especially following a tragedy where children and their care worker were so brutally attacked in the middle of the day? Gardaí have successfully policed more than 700 protests so far this year. Some of these protests have been bad-tempered, with individual colleagues across this House directly targeted, but there have been no expressions of support from those in Sinn Féin for our front-line gardaí. Why? It is because they cannot acknowledge good policing and because they want to politicise, personalise and attack not only the Minister for Justice but the Garda Commissioner. I also want to raise one particular aspect of Sinn Féin's reaction to recent events. As part of my brief in the Department of Health, I meet with people in drug and alcohol addiction and also provide the services to help them. I have never posted a picture or video on social media of a vulnerable person in need of help. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, last week used a picture of a clearly identifiable and vulnerable man for a cheap publicity stunt. It was posted on the Sinn Féin leader’s social media account, which has almost 200,000 followers, and waved around this House during Leaders’ Questions. A baseless connection was made between someone in addiction being a danger to children and the wider public. An innocent person was put forward as someone to be feared and avoided. We know the truth now. The mask of Sinn Féin has slipped. It is clear that there is not one vulnerable group that Sinn Féin will not use for their own political ends. That man is someone's son, perhaps someone's brother or someone's father. God knows what he is going through. You used him. How nasty, how cheap, how typically Sinn Féin.	spk_220

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the brutal attack at Gaelscoil Choláiste Mhuire on Parnell Square. But make no mistake, the looting of shops, the burning of vehicles and the attacks on gardaí had nothing to do with honouring the victims of that assault. The riot was fuelled by hate and thuggery and there are elements within our society who have come to the fore in recent times: nasty, far right agitators, so-called patriots who wrap the tricolour around bigotry and intolerance and spout their hatred on social media. There are international figures too who speak of events in Ireland about which they know nothing. I urge people not to believe everything the see, read and hear on social media. Question everything. Seek facts and not lies or distortion of the truth. Do not let liars and thugs shape the narrative. It is worrying that, as the  The Minister for Justice and the Commissioner have my and the Government’s full support. They, and the ordinary members of An Garda Síochána and the emergency services who kept us safe last week, also have the support of most people across our shared island.

Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-11-21	dail	33	Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_14	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the House, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, on the Second Stage of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2023. This is an annual technical Bill comprising seven sections, all of which are focused on the specific area of health insurance. I will start with an overview of the market and the risk equalisation scheme. Currently, 46.8% of the population in Ireland hold private health insurance. This amounts to 2.48 million people and represents a total annual premium income of approximately €3.18 billion. Health insurance in Ireland is provided according to four principles: open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefit and community rating. Unlike a risk-rated market, in a community-rated private health insurance market, everyone pays the same price for a particular health insurance policy. Insurers cannot take into account personal circumstances like health status or age, in which case older and sicker people would pay more for health insurance than they currently do. The risk equalisation scheme is the mechanism designed to support the objective of a community-rated health insurance market. It has operated since 1 January 2013 and is provided for under the Health Insurance Acts. Under the risk equalisation scheme, funds are redistributed in the form of credits to compensate insurers for the additional cost of insuring older and sicker members. The credits are funded by stamp duty payable by health insurance providers for each health insurance policy issued. The stamp duty levies are collected by the Revenue Commissioners and transferred to the risk equalisation fund, which is administered by the Health Insurance Authority. The risk equalisation scheme is designed to be Exchequer-neutral, that is, the credits are funded entirely by the stamp duties raised annually. The risk equalisation credits and stamp duty are updated on an annual basis to ensure they align with the estimates of the insured population and the type, number and cost of claims that will be made on the health insurance plans. Amendments to the health insurance legislation are required each year to update the level of risk equalisation credits and stamp duty levies necessary to fund the credits. This is the main purpose of the Bill. The Health Insurance Authority provided the Minister with an annual report which analysed market data for a 12-month period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. This report recommended the risk equalisation credit rates and the stamp duty levies required to fund them to apply from 1 April 2024. The Minister approved the risk equalisation credits to apply in 2024 and the Minister for Finance has approved the corresponding stamp duty levies. There are three risk equalisation credits and this Bill makes amendments to all three. This year, there will be an increased proportion of credits relating to health status rather than age. Increasing the proportion of credits associated with health status means that more credits are based on actual claims experience, rather than risk predictors like age. This helps to share risk more effectively across insurers. The amendments outlined in the Bill take account of the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance market, the aim of avoiding overcompensation being made to insurers and the aim of having fair and open competition in the market, as required under the EU framework for state aid. I will now outline the specific sections of the Bill. Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994. Section 2 amends section 11C of the principal Act to provide for 1 April 2024 as the effective date for revised credits payable from the risk equalisation fund. Section 3 amends the amount specified for the purposes of the hospital utilisation credit for both the overnight and the day-case rate. The amounts are applicable on or after 1 April 2024. The Bill will increase the hospital utilisation credit from €125 to €163 for nights and from €75 to €81 for days. This is in line with the move towards increasing credits related to health status. Section 4 replaces table 2 in Schedule 4 to the principal Act. This table revises the applicable age-related health credits payable from the risk equalisation fund. The amounts are applicable on or after 1 April 2024. The Bill provides for decreases in the age-related risk equalisation credits payable for the age groups over 65. The amount of the credit depends on the person's age, sex and whether he or she has advanced or non-advanced cover. The changes in the risk equalisation credits reflect a move towards having a greater proportion of credits related to health status rather than age. Section 5 amends the percentage specified as the proportion of a health insurance claim that exceeds a certain threshold within a calendar year that insurers will be compensated for under the high cost claims pool. The revised proportion will apply on and after 1 April 2024. The high-cost claims pool targets subsidies towards the claims' costs of sicker customers to spread the risk of insuring sicker customers among insurers. The high-cost claims pool operates by compensating a proportion of a health insurance claim that exceeds a certain threshold, currently €50,000, within a calendar year. The remainder of the claim will be covered by the insurer. The Bill will increase the percentage of the claim compensated for under the high-cost claims pool from 40% to 45%. The threshold will remain at €50,000. Increasing the percentage of the claim to be covered is in line with the move towards increasing the share of credits related to health status. Section 6 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to specify the applicable stamp duty rates to apply in the market for 2024. The amount of stamp duty levy is calculated to align with the expected risk equalisation credits. The risk equalisation scheme is Exchequer-neutral. It is not funded by the State and the State does not derive any funds from it. When the Health Insurance Authority makes a recommendation on the amount of stamp duty levy, it must also avoid sustaining surpluses or deficits in the risk equalisation fund. The amount of stamp duty payable on a health insurance contract depends on whether a contract is advanced or non-advanced. Non-advanced contracts provide for mostly public hospital cover, while advanced contracts provide a higher level of cover and cover in private hospitals. For next year, all rates of the stamp duty will be reduced. The stamp duty payable on non-advanced health insurance contracts from 1 April 2024 will be €105 per adult, a decrease of €4 from 2023 rates, and €35 per child, a decrease of €1. On advanced health insurance contracts, the stamp duty will be €420 per adult, a decrease of €18 from 2023 rates, and €140 per child, a decrease of €6. A surplus of €25 million is expected in the risk equalisation fund as there was a lower level of claims on the fund than anticipated and the growth in the insured population was higher than expected. The Health Insurance Authority recommended that the €25 million surplus should be used to reduce the level of stamp duty that would otherwise be payable. Section 7 provides for the Short Title, commencement, collective citation and construction of the Bill. To summarise, this Bill allows us to maintain the community-rated health insurance market. The provisions of the Bill increase the effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme. Risk equalisation credits based on age are reallocated to those based on health status, without increasing the stamp duty payable. Increasing the proportion of credits associated with health status helps to share risk more effectively across insurers. Importantly, the programme for Government commits to retaining access to private healthcare services for people in Ireland, ensuring choice for those accessing healthcare. This Bill continues our policy of ensuring solidarity with and affordable premiums for sicker and older people. These policy aims are also supported by the public. According to a survey carried out in 2021 by the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, 79% of those surveyed agreed that premium prices should not be dictated by a person’s current health. The same survey confirmed 72% agreed that older people should not be charged more for health insurance. Finally, while the Government continues to maintain the community rated private health insurance market, I would also like to conclude by highlighting this Government’s commitment to improving public health services under the Sláintecare programme. Some recent Government achievements include the addition of 22,000 healthcare workers and an increase of 1,000 in hospital bed capacity in the last three years. Waiting times were reduced in 2022 for the first time since 2015. There has been an unprecedented shift in patient care from the hospital to the community sector. Progress for patients has been made in the rollout of national clinical strategies including in cancer care, maternity care, trauma care, palliative care, critical care, dementia care, mental health services, older persons services, health and wellbeing programmes, social inclusion, screening services and in our National Ambulance Service. The new public-only consultant contract is in place and more than 1,000 new and existing consultants have signed up to date. Public patient inpatient hospital charges have been abolished. Investment in women’s health care has increased and State-funded IVF has been introduced. These are just a few areas where we have seen better access, increased capacity, and improved outcomes. As access to these services improves, the Department will monitor the impact on the health insurance market over time.  On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, I commend this Bill to the House."	spk_161

He is correct that there have been more than 50 overdoses in the Dublin area since Thursday of last week. They were associated with the use of heroin that was adulterated with nitazines, which are potent, synthetic opioids. Naloxone is distributed by the HSE. I commend the members of the HSE in the Dublin region who are on the front line, such as outreach workers, ensuring the message regarding this toxic drug gets out. People are being assisted by hospital emergency departments and Dublin Fire Brigade. There was a swift response to what happened. On the Deputy's other query about other substances coming in, the HSE is acutely aware of the dangers of new drugs. We have a range of methods, including working with our EU partners around emerging drug trends and with emergency departments here on syringe analysis and wastewater treatment analysis in the context of drugs coming in. The Deputy is correct about the roll-out of naloxone. There is a budget of €114 million for the HSE and the Department to deal with the matter of drugs. I will be working on that.	spk_56

MCAP is operated by the primary care reimbursement service of the HSE and is a statutory programme to enable clinicians and patients to access prescribed cannabis-based products for the treatment of three specific conditions, as specified in the HPRA's 2017 report, Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review, which was commissioned by the Minister for Health. The three conditions are spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions while under expert medical supervision, intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy despite the use of standard antiemetic regimes while under expert medical supervision, and severe refractory treatment-resistant epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications while under expert medical supervision. The prescribed cannabis-based products are not authorised medicines that have gone through the normal processes for medicines to get a marketing authorisation, hence the requirement for the programme to access the products. There are authorised cannabis-based medicines for the treatment of conditions such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and nausea. As such, these are not available for inclusion in the programme and can be prescribed like any other authorised medicine in the normal manner. The Misuse Of Drugs (Prescription And Control Of Supply Of Cannabis For Medical Use) Regulations 2019, SI 262/2019, set out the legal provisions for the operation of the medical cannabis access programme and the legal obligations for healthcare professionals and commercial operators. Schedule 1 of the regulations comprises the specified controlled drugs, specifications for which are defined in the regulations, which may be included in the programme for patient treatment. Manufacturers can apply to the HPRA to have their cannabis-based product assessed for inclusion in Schedule 1 as a product that meets the requirements for a specified controlled drug, as set out in the regulations. Any addition to the Schedule 1 products is done by way of ministerial approval, by statutory instrument. Ten cannabis-based products have been added to the regulations for prescribing by consultants for their patients. The MCAP commenced in late 2021. To date, 49 patients have been treated under the programme. Some 34 patients have been treated for reason 1, which is spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions. Three patients are for reason 2, which is intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy despite the use of standard antiemetic regimes. Twelve patients are for reason 3, which is severe refractory epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications.	spk_3

This work has been undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health. The evidence synthesis review will be peer reviewed after which a clinical group will review the evidence synthesis to ascertain whether evidence exists to expand the scope of conditions covered by the programme.

I am pleased to note Deputy Nash's support for the changes to ensure full-time workers on the national minimum wage remain outside the higher rates of USC. A full-time worker on the minimum wage will see an increase in their take-home pay of approximately €2,300 annually. As incomes rise it is vital that adjustments are made to our personal tax system. USC is a more sustainable charge than the levies it replaced and is applied at a low rate and on a wide base. Currently, the exemption threshold for USC applies to individuals who earn €13,000 or less per annum. Deputy Boyd Barrett's proposal to increase the exemption limit of USC to €100,000 would significantly narrow the income tax base and expose our economy to significant risks in the event of a future economic downturn. Deputies Nash and Shortall are incorrect to characterise the budget tax changes as tax cuts. In fact, the personal income tax changes have been carefully designed to ensure workers do not find themselves paying income tax for the first time or more income tax solely because of wage growth. We must also preserve a broad and stable income tax base to ensure our personal taxation system is competitive and resilient. This is in line with the programme for Government commitment regarding indexation of credits and bands, with 220,000 people taken out of the top rate since the Covid pandemic. Ireland has a highly progressive income tax system, one of the most progressive of any EU or OECD country, which means the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those more able to pay. Budget 2024 personal income tax changes were designed to ensure the monetary gain was capped at €70,044 per annum. Anyone earning in excess of that amount does not receive any additional benefit from the personal tax package. Furthermore, the gain as a percentage of net income was actually greater and more progressive for many taxpayers earning below that income level. To respond to Deputy Shortall on the matter of refundable tax credits, there are no current plans to introduce a refundable income tax credit. This was examined as part of this year's tax strategy group process in advance of budget 2024. Overall, the review identified a number of issues with the proposal. For example, the introduction of refundable tax credits could potentially prove to be very costly and provide relatively little benefit to the majority of individuals. Such credits could also have potential behavioural impacts on labour supply and reduce the incentive to work or to take on additional work. This Government is acutely conscious of the impact of rising interest rates and mortgage costs on many taxpayers. It is for this reason the Minister for Finance introduced a temporary, one-year targeted form of mortgage interest tax relief as part of budget 2024. Specifically regarding Deputy Doherty's contribution relating to the rationale for the €80,000 mortgage balance threshold, the Minister for Finance is of the view that taxpayers who had mortgage balances of less than €80,000 on 31 December 2022 are in general more likely to be in a relatively strong financial position in comparison with those with larger mortgage balances. Such individuals are likely to have significant amounts of equity built up and to have relatively low loan-to-value ratios. This means such individuals should have better opportunities to switch their mortgages and obtain more favourable interest rates, which will ultimately reduce their interest liability without the need for Government intervention. Finally, it is important to point out that if the qualifying threshold for mortgage balances had been set below €80,000, it would have resulted in a less targeted scheme and, as a consequence, would have increased the cost on the Exchequer. In response to Deputies Doherty, Conway-Walsh, Nash and Shortall, the purpose of the new residential premises rental income relief is to provide for a new tax incentive for small-scale landlords. This measure is targeted specifically at attracting and retaining small-scale landlords in the private sector. Landlords are an essential feature of a functioning housing market. Rising rents are driven by a shortage of supply, so stabilising and increasing the supply of rental properties should ease this upward pressure on rental prices and make it easier for prospective tenants to find affordable homes. The majority of landlords in Ireland are private individuals owning one or two rental properties, often with a view to providing an alternative to a pension income in retirement. Of those registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, 86% are small landlords. A total of 121,000 have one property, and 28,000 have two properties. In response to the concerns of Deputies Conway-Walsh and Nash about the potential for house price increases arising from the existence of the help-to-buy scheme, previous studies carried out by Indecon economic consultants found that the main driver of house prices was the mismatch between supply and demand rather than the existence of the scheme. Similarly, the review by Mazars in 2022 found there is no definitive evidence that the scheme pushed up the prices of new houses. In fact, Mazars found that the prices paid for new homes by people who received the help-to-buy relief were slightly lower than new house prices in the economy in general, likely because of the €500,000 price eligibility cap.On the comments made by Deputies Nash and Shortall about the vacant homes tax, the Government believes it is appropriate that every available lever is deployed to incentivise the use of existing housing stock across the country. By increasing the rate of the tax in this Bill, the vacant homes tax would have the effect of penalising any property owners whose properties remain vacant in both the current and next chargeable periods. My officials will monitor the impact of the rate change as it comes into effect. Deputies Doherty and Nash spoke about the RZLT and agricultural land. It is important to note that this tax measure is a key pillar of the Government's response to address the urgent need to increase housing supply in suitable locations. Equally, it is important that affected landowners, including owners of farmland, have sufficient opportunity to engage with the mapping process and that a fair and transparent process is applied when local authorities consider what land should be placed on the RZLT maps. Therefore, as part of budget 2024, it was decided to extend the liability date of the tax by one year from February 2024 to February 2025. The purpose of this deferral is to allow for the annual mapping cycle to complete and afford landowners another opportunity to make submissions if their land is included on the maps prepared by local authorities. I thank Deputies Doherty, Dillon, O’Reilly and Alan Farrell for their comments in support of the enhancements to the research and development tax credit. This credit is a strategically important element of Ireland’s overall support for research and development activities. It ensures Ireland remains an attractive location for both domestic and inward investment in innovative industries.  With regard to Deputy Boyd Barrett’s remarks on the proportion of the research and development tax credit being paid to large organisations rather than SMEs, it is noted that due to the nature of the credit, which is based on actual research and development expenses incurred, it is not unexpected that larger companies make up a large proportion of recipients of the credit in monetary terms, given that these are the companies which have the size and scale to fund more extensive research and development activities. Smaller companies, however, are also benefiting from the credit. In 2021, the majority of claimants, 88%, were non-large corporates division companies, or non-LCD companies, which is a proxy name for SMEs. Furthermore, 65% of 2021 claimants were firms with less than 50 employees. SMEs are by far the main recipient of the research and development tax credit scheme, accounting for an annual average of 90% of all claims from 2012 to 2021. I will respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett’s comments on the increase in the research and development tax credit, as set out by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, in his opening speech. The increase will maintain the existing net benefit of the credit for companies in the scope of the new pillar 2 15% minimum tax rate, whereas for smaller claimant companies, it will deliver a real increase in credit value. It is estimated that almost 60% of claimant companies are outside the scope of pillar 2 and, therefore, are small businesses which will see a real benefit from the increased credit. Smaller claimants will also benefit from the doubling of the first-year payment threshold, which will provide a vital cash flow support for small research and development projects. I welcome the support of Deputies Nash and Dillon for the increase in the project cap for the film tax credit. I believe this increase will aid the audiovisual sector to be competitive with other jurisdictions with regard to attracting high-value productions. Deputy Nash asked whether the Minister for Finance, when he was deciding on the future of the bank levy, considered applying a levy to the non-bank regulated entities. I can confirm that the Minister considered this possibility, but it did not prove possible to determine an appropriate legislatively robust way to distinguish between the various forms of such entities. The Minister intends that this matter be further considered during 2024. Deputy Boyd Barrett said that the bank levy, which is targeted to raise €200 million in 2024, is tiny. I would argue that €200 million is far from tiny and I would point out to the Deputy that for 2022 and 2023, the bank levy was targeted to raise €87 million per annum so the revised target yield represents considerably more than twice what was raised in each of the previous two years, and is also one third more than the €150 million which was the revenue target each year between 2014 and 2021.	spk_144
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-10-24	dail	33	Health Service Funding: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_13	I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the funding for the health service in 2024. This was discussed in the House last week, and I would like to reiterate the Government’s commitment to ensuring our health services are well funded. The €22.5 billion health budget for 2024 is the biggest ever and will facilitate the continued delivery of quality affordable healthcare services. Deputies have referenced funding for waiting lists and emergency departments but it is important to point out that the emergency department action plan is fully funded, as is the waiting list action plan. I also reiterate that funding to maintain existing services has been provided to meet inflation and rising patient demand. Resources are in place to hire 2,000 staff in addition to those who are already in place and are providing vital services in our communities. Provision has been made for the opening and staffing of six new surgical hubs across the country, including in my own constituency in Galway. The demand for healthcare has increased and continues to rise due to our ageing population and pent-up demand for services which arose as a result of Covid-19. As I have previously said, it will be necessary to achieve cost savings where we can and ensure taxpayer’s money is spent as efficiently as possible. I have every confidence that the Department of Health and the HSE will ensure this happens in 2024 and future years.  As Minister of State with responsibility for public health, well-being and the national drugs strategy, I believe some of the best use of public money in our health service can be seen in spending on programmes that emphasise prevention. One way to avoid the onset of medical conditions is through the promotion of healthy lifestyles. The Healthy Ireland framework, backed by the Healthy Ireland fund, is designed to counteract and prevent negative health outcomes as a result of smoking, alcohol, poor diet and physical inactivity. It also addresses the wider social and environmental factors which impact on health and well-being.  We have gradually increased investment in the Healthy Ireland fund since 2017. In 2023, it was just over €14 million. An additional €2.3 million will be allocated in 2024, bringing the total to €16.5 million for this important initiative. An additional €300,000 has been allocated to facilitate the recruitment of four community food and nutrition workers, which will bring the national complement to 19. These workers are a vital support to local communities in developing responses to food poverty and insecurity. Some €1 million will be provided for the further development of outdoor exercise facilities including GAA walking trails and facilities to support outdoor swimming. Some 22,000 people are expected to engage with HSE anti-smoking services in 2024. A quarter of these people will require medical intervention and supports. A total of €1.82 million is being provided to assist these people in kicking the habit. The development of a new national sexual health strategy is continuing. The budget for free home sexually transmitted infection testing kits will increase by €700,000. We will also increase funding for our national HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis programme, PrEP, to help to fund additional staff and increase access to PrEP medication.  As part of our response to tackling gambling addiction, some €500,000 will be provided in 2024 to develop supports for the estimated 130,000 people with problems in this area. In the last two years alone, funding for our drug and alcohol services has increased by almost €10 million. Core funding for our drug and alcohol task forces and section 39 organisations has increased.  For the first time, €1.5 million in funding for drug and alcohol education and awareness programmes has been provided. In 2024, we are going to deliver new dual diagnosis hubs, which will support the recovery of young people with drug dependency and mental health issues. There is also dedicated funding for services after people embark on their road to recovery to support their integration into everyday life.  In conclusion, I acknowledge the hard work and dedication of all the workers and professionals in our healthcare system. I thank them for the care they provide to people who are often at their most vulnerable.	spk_209
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-10-19	dail	33	Investment in Healthcare: Statements	dbsect_32	As Deputies are aware, ensuring people are healthy and active and that they get the healthcare they need when they need it is a priority for this Government. These are not just empty words. Let the facts speak to the Government’s commitment to ensuring that our health services are well funded. Over the past three years, the Government has delivered record investment in healthcare. The Government’s €22.5 billion health budget for 2024 is the biggest ever and will facilitate the continued delivery and expansion of quality, affordable healthcare services. This funding equates to a spend of €4,000 for every man, woman and child in the State. The emergency department action plan is fully funded, which means that anybody who arrives in an emergency department having suffered an accident or medical emergency will be seen and will get the treatment he or she needs. The waiting list action plan is also fully funded, which will reduce waiting times for life-altering treatment. Funding to maintain existing services has been provided to meet inflation and rising patient demand. Resources are in place to hire 2,000 staff additional to those already there. Provision has been made for the opening and staffing of six new surgical hubs across the country, including in my constituency in Galway.  We must be honest and say that, despite the great strides made in recent years, we need to do more in the coming years. We must also point to the fact we have an ageing population and pent-up demand for services has arisen as a result of Covid-19, so the demand for healthcare has increased and continues to rise. It is clear, too, that, the HSE must deliver services in a more efficient manner, achieving cost savings where it can and ensuring taxpayer’s money is spend as efficiently as possible. I have every confidence that the Department of Health and the HSE will ensure this happens in 2024 and future years. I will turn to developments in the areas for which I am responsible as Minister with responsibility for public health, well-being and the national drugs strategy, outline some of the progress made in recent years and set out some exciting new initiatives under way. Among the best uses of public money in our health service is spending to avoid the onset of medical conditions through the promotion of healthy lifestyles. A key element of this preventative approach is our healthy Ireland framework, at the core of which is the healthy Ireland fund. Working with partners including Departments, agencies, NGOs, community organisations and the country’s 31 local authorities, this fund focuses on health and well-being with programmes designed to counteract and prevent negative health outcomes as a result of smoking, alcohol, poor diet and physical inactivity, as well as addressing the wider social and environmental factors which impact on health and well-being. Established in 2017 with an initial annual budget of €5 million, we have gradually increased investment in the fund in the years since. Our budget for the fund in 2023 was just over €14 million and I was delighted to secure an additional €2.3 million for 2024, bringing the total to some €16.5 million. That represents an increase of 16%. That is new money and new investment in this important initiative. Knowing the importance of good nutrition and the development of good eating habits, I secured an additional €300,000 to facilitate the recruitment of four community food and nutrition workers, which will bring the national complement to 19. These workers are a vital support to local communities in developing responses to food poverty and insecurity. I am pleased to highlight the further development of outdoor exercise facilities. In 2024 we will build on the success of the GAA walking trails initiative that I announced earlier this year. The Government will also provide funding to develop facilities to support outdoor swimming.Some €1 million will be provided for these initiatives next year.  Our smoking rates continue to give cause for concern, given the huge impact they have not only on the individual in terms of poor health outcomes but also on the wider health system. Great strides have been made, with the percentage of the population who smoke falling from 23% in 2015 to 18% in 2022. Some 22,000 people are expected to engage with HSE anti-smoking services in 2024, of whom a quarter will require medical intervention and supports. A total of €1.82 million is being provided to assist these people in kicking the habit. Moving to sexual health, the House will be aware that work continues on the development of a new national sexual health strategy and as part of this we will increase the budget for free home sexually transmitted infection, STI, testing by €700,000, allowing people to test in the privacy of their own homes. Some 91,000 testing kits were provided last year, and this valuable initiative will expand over the course of 2024. We will also increase funding for our national HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis programme, PrEP, to help fund additional staff and increase access to PrEP medication, helping to provide better access to HIV prevention for more people.  As part of our response to tackling gambling addiction, some €500,000 will be provided in 2024 to develop supports for the estimated 130,000 people with problems in this area. Since my appointment to the Department of Health almost ten months ago, I have met many people who use drugs, some of whom are living with addiction, medical experts and people delivering addiction services on the ground. One key message that I have received has been that we need to change how we think about and tackle drug misuse and addiction.  At the heart of this is ensuring that core services are funded and in 2023, I provided an increase in core funding for our drug and alcohol task forces and section 39 organisations. Knowing the importance of education, I also provided €1.5 million in funding for a drug and alcohol education and awareness programme, the first time such funding has been provided. For 2024, we are going to deliver new groundbreaking services never before provided. They include dual diagnosis hubs, which will support the recovery of young people with drug dependency and mental health issues, and dedicated funding for services after people embark on their road to recovery to support their integration into everyday life through housing, employment, education and other supports. It is important to note that in the last two years alone. funding for our drug and alcohol services has increased by almost €10 million. I am keen that we continue to build on this so as to ensure the fantastic care that is provided from within the community is supported.  In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to all the workers and professionals working across our healthcare system for their hard work and dedication, and to thank them for the care they provide to people who are often at their most vulnerable. These people are often forgotten in a politically-charged debate but it would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to their enormous contribution in helping to keep people healthy for longer.	spk_305
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-10-18	dail	33	Trends in Mortality and Estimates of Excess Mortality: Statements	dbsect_17	I welcome the opportunity to discuss trends in mortality and estimates of excess mortality. The Department of Health actively monitors and reviews all available data on mortality, including excess mortality, as it becomes available, to gain a better insight on underlying mortality trends in Ireland and factors influencing these. While the Department does not produce estimates of excess mortality, it works closely with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and other stakeholders to monitor estimates of excess mortality. A number of different methodologies have been developed by organisations and academics internationally to try to estimate levels of excess mortality. It is important to note that estimation methods vary depending on a number of factors including differences in methodology and the data used. There is, therefore, no internationally agreed method on the estimation of excess mortality. Official data on mortality in Ireland is collected by the CSO based on deaths registered with the General Register Office, GRO. The latest final data on deaths from the CSO is for the deaths occurring in 2020. Provisional data, based on date of registration of the death, is currently available for 2021 and 2022. It is important to note that in Ireland currently, a legal period of three months is allowed for the registration of a death. Analysis by the general register office has found that, on average, approximately 82% of deaths are registered within this three-month time frame and, therefore, data for the most recent period is provisional and caution is required in interpreting this data. Ireland’s age-standardised all cause death rate declined steadily from 1,152 deaths per 100,000 in 2007 to 923 per 100,000 in 2019. In 2022, the provisional age-standardised all cause death rate was 937 per 100,000. While this was an increase from 2021, it was below the age-standardised all cause death rate of years prior to 2018. As most causes of death vary significantly with people's age and sex, the use of standardised death rates improves comparability over time and between countries. A key factor potentially influencing mortality trends is demographic change and the changing age structure. Ireland’s total population increased by 8.1% between census 2016 and 2022. There was a fall in population in some younger age groups such as children under four years. In contrast, the number of persons in Ireland aged 65 and over increased by 22%, more than double the 10% increase that occurred in the EU 27 over the same period. Within this age category, the highest increase was experienced by those aged 75 to 84, growing by 28%, while the EU 27 only experienced a 3.4% increase in the 75 to 84 age group. While Ireland continues to have a younger age profile than most of the EU, our population is ageing and coming more in line with the EU average. As we might expect, persons in older age groups account for the majority of deaths. In 2019, 82% of all deaths which occurred in Ireland were among persons aged 65 and over. Some 29% of all deaths were in the 75 to 84 age group. We know that the number of adults aged 65 years and older is increasing by just under 4% annually and the number of adults aged 75 and older is increasing by just over 4% a year. The substantial increase in the number of persons in these age groups annually gives rise to an expectation of an increase in the absolute number of deaths occurring in Ireland, compared with the number of deaths that occurred during the years 2016 to 2019. All data on excess mortality are estimates and, as I noted earlier, many different methodologies have been developed by a number of organisations internationally to try to estimate levels of excess mortality. Some of these methodologies are long-established, such as EuroMOMO, a European mortality monitoring activity, while many were developed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, such as by Eurostat and the CSO. It is important to note that the different estimation methods vary considerably in the estimation of expected deaths. For example, the number of years involved in the baseline average may vary, where 2016 to 2019, is a four-year average, while others use a single year. The actual timeline may vary, for example, the years 2016 to 2019 or 2010 to 2013. Methods may allow for seasonal variation. Methods may apply statistical significance tests before mortality is considered to be excess. Nationally and internationally, work is currently under way to further refine methods to estimate excess mortality. EuroMOMO, Eurostat and the CSO have published estimates of excess mortality during winter 2022-23 for Ireland. The most recent estimates from EuroMOMO estimate that during winter 2022-23, Ireland experienced excess all cause mortality for all ages during five consecutive weeks in late December 2022 to early January 2023. Mortality has been close to or below baseline since the second week of January 2023. EuroMOMO estimates that other European countries, including the UK, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland, also experienced excess mortality for a period last winter when flu was circulating at high levels. When considering the EuroMOMO data on excess mortality, it important to note that influenza activity was at very high levels in Ireland during December 2022 and early to mid-January 2023. The number of influenza case notifications to the HPSC in the last weeks of 2022 and early weeks of 2023 was the highest of any week since 2017. Previously, flu surges of this magnitude recorded similar increases in excess deaths in winter 2017-18, which was characterised as a severe flu season. While EuroMOMO data is the most robust available, the modelling of excess deaths does not take into consideration Ireland's 4% increase in adults aged over 65 from 2019 onwards. This gives rise to an underestimation of expected deaths and an overestimation of excess mortality. Eurostat publishes monthly estimates of excess mortality that compares the number of people who died from any cause in a month with an historical baseline for that month from pre-pandemic years, 2016 to 2019. Since March 2020, Eurostat estimates that the EU27 has had a higher number of deaths than the 2016 to 2019 average in almost every month. Since early 2022, Ireland has followed a similar pattern, that is, the number of deaths in each month has been higher than the average number of deaths that occurred during the same month between 2016 and 2019. This method does not account for population growth or an ageing population, which significantly underestimates Ireland's expected deaths. As we know, the number of persons in Ireland aged 65 and over increased by 22%, more than double the 10% increase that occurred in the EU27 over the same period. Some 82% of all deaths which occurred in Ireland were among persons aged 65 and over. While both EuroMOMO and Eurostat are based on similar data on the number of deaths that occur, because of the different methodologies used to estimate expected deaths and excess deaths, these methods generate different estimates of excess mortality levels.The CSO recently published an update of their frontier series publication, Measuring Mortality Using Public Data Sources 2019-2023, which includes an analysis of  An issue impacting analysis of mortality trends and estimates of excess mortality for Ireland is the time lag in death registration. As I outlined, in Ireland a legal period of three months is currently provided for the registration of a death. In the short term, the response to address the issue of this time lag has been the use of  Considerable analysis is ongoing in relation to mortality trends in Ireland. In 2022, neoplasms, diseases of the circulatory system and external causes were the main causes of death among persons aged under 65 years. Diseases of the circulatory system, neoplasms and diseases of the respiratory system were the main causes of death among persons aged 65 years and over. Data for 2022 are provisional and based on date of registration of death. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre will continue to participate in the EuroMOMO network to monitor trends in excess mortality during the upcoming winter. The EuroMOMO network is also working closely with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, to further develop and enhance its methodology to estimate excess mortality. The CSO is also continuing to examine methods for estimating excess deaths and mortality analysis. Internationally, the Department of Health is engaging closely with the OECD in its work on incorporating demographic change in its excess mortality estimates and the use of excess mortality as an indicator of the impact of climate change. The Department of Health will continue to actively monitor and review all available data on mortality as these become available to gain a better insight on underlying mortality trends in Ireland and factors influencing these. The Department will also continue to work with all stakeholders to determine the most accurate estimates of mortality data in Ireland.	spk_167

Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-10-11	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 4: General (Resumed)	dbsect_18	I am pleased to share details of the Department's budget 2024 allocations in the area for which I am responsible as Minister of State with responsibility for public health well-being and the national drugs strategy. As Deputies are aware, ensuring that people are healthy and active and that they get the healthcare they need is a priority for this Government. A key element of this approach is our healthy Ireland framework, at the core of which is the healthy Ireland fund. Established in 2017 with an initial annual budget of €5 million, the fund is used to support our partners, including include Departments and agencies, NGOs, community organisations and 31 local authorities, in delivering programmes focused on health and well-being. Mindful of the importance of this measure, we have gradually increased investment in this fund over the years since it was established. Our budget for the fund in 2023 was just over €14 million. I am delighted to announce today that I secured an additional €2.3 million for 2024, bringing the total to €16.5 million. That represents an increase of 16%. This money will be used to progress a number of priorities, including the employment of staff to co-ordinate activities, to support the Sláintecare healthy communities programme that provides targeted supports to some of the most deprived communities in the country and to help to facilitate exercise for older adults and others who may be living with chronic conditions. I have also secured an additional €300,000 to facilitate the recruitment of four community food and nutrition workers. This will bring the national complement to 19. These workers are a vital support to local communities in developing responses to food poverty and insecurity. I am particularly pleased to also announce that I have secured funding to develop new walking trails in communities, building on the success of the GAA walking trails initiative I announced earlier in the year. I have also secured funding to develop facilities for outdoor swimming. Some €1 million will be provided for these initiatives. On tobacco control, great strides have been made with the percentage of the population that smokes falling from 23% in 2015 to 18% in 2022. Approximately 22,000 people are expected to engage with the HSE anti-smoking services in 2024. Of these, one quarter will require medical intervention and supports. A total of €1.82 million is provided to assist these people to kick the habit. Moving to sexual health, Members may be aware that work is ongoing in developing a new national sexual health strategy. As part of this we will increase the budget for free home sexually transmitted infection testing by €700,000, allowing people to test in the privacy of their own homes. Some 91,000 testing kits were provided last year. This valuable initiative will expand over the course of 2024. We will also increase funding for our national HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis programme, PrEP, launched in November 2019. It currently receives funding of €5.4 million and our investment of €600,000 will fund additional staff and increase access to PrEP medication, helping to provide better access to HIV prevention for more people. As part of our response to tackling gambling addiction, €500,000 will be provided in 2024 to develop supports for the estimated 130,000 people with problems in this area. Since my appointment to the Department of Health just nine months ago, I have met with medical experts, people delivering addiction services on the ground and people who use drugs, some of whom are living with addiction. A key message I received is that we need to change how we think about and tackle drug misuse and addiction. This year, I have already ensured that core funding for our drug and alcohol task forces and section 39 organisations increased by €3.5 million. In addition,I provided €1.5 million in funding for a drug and alcohol education and awareness programme. This is the first time such funding has been provided. For 2024, we will deliver ground-breaking services never before provided. These will include dual diagnosis hubs that will support the recovery of young people with drug dependency and mental health issues and dedicated funding for services for people who embark on the road to recovery from drug addiction to support their integration into everyday life, for example, through housing and employment, education and other supports. It is important to note that in the past two years alone, funding for our drug and alcohol services has increased by almost €10 million. I am keen that we will continue to build on this in order to ensure that the fantastic care which is provided from within the community is supported. In total next year, the State will invest in excess of €145 million on drug and alcohol addiction services.	spk_147

The north inner city drug and alcohol task force plays an invaluable role in addressing drug problems in line with the national drugs strategy and in the north-east inner city. The decision to reconstitute the task force followed extensive consultation with former members of the task force and local stakeholders. I have been in this role for the past six months and from my point of view it is very important that we get this task force back up and running. We want to make sure we have adequate services that are funded. More than €2 million is being allocated to services in this area. I want to make sure we get the task force back up and running and those services rolled out. This is my priority as Minister of State with responsibility for this area.	spk_39

Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-26	dail	33	Children's Health Ireland - Patient safety concerns and reviews in paediatric orthopaedic surgical services: Statements, Questions and Answers	dbsect_14	I am sharing time with Deputy Durkan. I want to begin by acknowledging the anxiety that many young patients and their families will be feeling this week, particularly the young patients who are directly involved in these reviews and incidents, as well as their parents and their families. Openness, transparency and learning for patients and families must be at the heart of our health service. These families must continue to be our priority as we move forward with a response to what has happened. I also want to take this opportunity to offer my deepest condolences to the parents and family of Dollceanna Carter on the loss of their beautiful daughter and sister. There are many other families, parents and children attending CHI at Temple Street for appointments and procedures this week, or who are waiting to hear about an appointment. It is vitally important that their concerns and questions are addressed in a comprehensive response that is now under way. I also recognise the frustration of families of patients who are waiting for surgery for spina bifida and scoliosis in particular, and the impact this wait continues to have on their daily lives. This Government has invested and will continue to invest significant funding to help clinicians reduce the amount of time children are waiting for important hospital appointments and procedures. Scoliosis and spina bifida have been identified as a priority in both the 2022 and 2023 waiting list action plans, with significant investment provided to increase capacity and staffing. Last year, there was a commitment of some €19 million of current and capital funding to tackle these waiting lists by improving the patient’s journey and creating additional capacity. I welcome the request by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, that the HSE explores all options to increase capacity for this vital service, including outsourcing care both at home and abroad. The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and CHI to drive progress on the waiting list action plan. I would like to assure children and their families that the Department of Health and the HSE remain committed to reducing the amount of time children are waiting for hospital appointments and procedures. I welcome the offer by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to meet with families who are directly impacted, as well as with the advocacy groups who work so hard on behalf of children with spina bifida and scoliosis and their families. I welcome that meetings will be happening this week. Listening to the voices and experiences of families and patients, as well as to those who advocate and care for them, are vital parts of how we learn and improve the quality of safety of our health services. I welcome the fact that the voices and views of these families and advocacy groups will be heard by Mr. Nayagam, the international expert who will be carrying out this important review. It is important that these young patients and their families continue to be the priority and be at the heart of this process. As the Minister has outlined, there are a number of investigations and processes under way to establish facts and find answers to the many questions we all have. I concur that it is important that the findings from these various processes are not pre-judged and that they are allowed to be conducted and completed in a fair and objective manner. These reports and their findings will be important to enable Mr. Nayagam to progress with his review. They will assist him in identifying the necessary learnings and improvements to be made in the service for the future and to ensure that the experiences of patients and their families can be continuously improved. These events have highlighted even further the need for openness and transparency and the need to ensure that the patient's voice is the heart of everything we do in the health sector in Ireland. Our priority now is to ensure that the patient safety concerns that have come to light are comprehensively addressed, that patients and families receive the assurances they deserve and that they are receiving high-quality patient-centred care. When things go wrong in our health services, it is vital that we have the systems in place to respond to them, to find answers for patients, their families and staff about what happened and why and, most importantly, to identify the ways we can learn for the wider health services. This is essential for us to continue to improve the safety and quality of all our services.	spk_128
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Health Service Executive	dbsect_2	The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, unfortunately cannot attend this morning as he is at the United Nations. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and I will take some of his questions. Timely completion of the new national children’s hospital, NCH, is a Government priority. Everything is being done to ensure it is completed as soon as possible. It is 90% complete against contract value. Substantial completion is informed by the main contractor's, BAM, programme outlining how and when it will complete the last 10%. The last programme update received from BAM suggested substantial completion could be achieved by May 2024. Frustratingly, construction progress has been significantly behind BAM’s programme. After months of engagement with BAM, an updated programme was submitted on 18 July. This is currently under review by the employer’s representative to determine compliance with the contract. The employer’s representative is the independent body responsible for enforcing the contract. The programme outlines how BAM proposes to complete the more than 40,000 separate activities required to finish the project. Given this welcome level of detail, it will take time to verify and validate. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, has been clear that it will not be commenting on any details until the employer’s representative has determined it to be a compliant programme. This includes any potential updates to the substantial completion date. Once construction is complete, the hospital will be handed over to Children’s Health Ireland, CHI, for commissioning. This will ensure the hospital is ready for patients and staff and is expected to take at least six months. In advance of the handover, the pre-commissioning phase is already well advanced to ensure the smooth, safe and efficient transition of services to the new children’s hospital. This includes a significant body of work to integrate the three hospitals from a clinical and operational perspective, and the build of a digital hospital system and a new electronic healthcare record system. There remains a shared ambition among all parties to see the NCH opened as soon as possible for the benefit of children and families. To achieve this, the Minister for Health urges and expects BAM to resource and deliver against its own programme.	spk_3
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Health Service Executive	dbsect_2	I reassure the Deputy that the Minister will come before the House next Tuesday regarding that issue. I reiterate the importance of the completion of the children's hospital. The NPHDB, which entered into the construction contract with BAM on behalf of the State, is doing everything it can to hold the contractor accountable for its delivery programme. There is continuous engagement between officials within the Department of Health, the HSE, the NPHDB and Children's Health Ireland. The Secretary General of the Department has recently written to BAM setting out his expectations of BAM to complete the hospital without delay. The Minister has also directly engaged with the NPHDB, the CHI chairs and the chief officers on the project so that he can be assured everything possible is being done. It is to be welcomed that all stakeholders have expressed a shared ambition to achieve this completion date as quickly as possible. However, I will reiterate and pass on the Deputy's concerns to the Minister.	spk_5
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Health Service Executive	dbsect_2	I assure the Deputy this is an absolute priority for the Minister and the Government.

We will keep the Deputy updated on this matter. It is an absolute priority.	spk_7
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Health Service Executive	dbsect_2	I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister who, as the Deputy knows, cannot be here. It is important to acknowledge the vital role that section 39 and section 56 organisations and their staff play in our health and social care sectors.They continue to have a key role in providing services to people with disabilities, vulnerable children, older people and in other social care settings. The Government has a clear interest in ensuring the stability and sustainability of these services. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is the lead Department on this topic, as the majority of the organisations in question fall under its remit. Officials in the Department of Health are working closely with their colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on this matter. I am aware that they have been engaging extensively with the unions over recent months under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and have been supported in these discussions by officials from the Department of Health, the HSE and Tusla. This process culminated in an offer being made in line with that accepted by the same trade unions in other sectors across the wider public sector in recent months. The offer to workers in this sector amounted to a 5% increase in funding for pay, effective from November 2023, with 3% backdated to April 2023, and a commitment to re-engage with trade union representatives following the next public sector pay agreement. Unfortunately, this offer was not accepted by trade union representatives. It is disappointing that their members were not afforded the opportunity to vote on whether they wished to accept the 5% increase in pay funding and that the unions instead elected to ballot for industrial action. As such action would impact negatively on people who rely on these services, I urge all parties to work on resolving any disputes through the appropriate forums and uphold industrial peace in the interests of people who use our health service. An announcement regarding the result of the ballot and any plan for industrial action is expected to be made by the unions at a press conference on Monday, 25 September. As this is an ongoing industrial relations matter, it would be inappropriate to comment any further at this point.	spk_9
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Health Service Executive	dbsect_2	I reiterate that section 39 and section 56 organisations and their staff play a vital role in our healthcare and social care sectors. Officials in the Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are waiting on the result of the ballot. Officials from both Departments remain available to re-engage with unions at any time in an effort to bring this matter to a resolution. It is also important to remember that these are private employers and, as such, the Government has no authority or ability to change the terms and conditions of these workers. I appreciate that there are many organisations with staff who have similar or equivalent roles to workers in the HSE. However, it must be noted that there are more than 1,500 organisations within the sector. As the State is not the employer, we have a limited ability to verify the position. Attempting to increase the pay of workers in this sector by 9.5% may result in further disparity. The Government has little or no information in relation to many of these organisations and the terms and conditions of their employees. I reiterate that officials are ready to engage with unions at any time to resolve this issue.	spk_11

The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and I will take some of his questions. Timely completion of the new national children’s hospital, NCH, is a Government priority. Everything is being done to ensure it is completed as soon as possible. It is 90% complete against contract value. Substantial completion is informed by the main contractor's, BAM, programme outlining how and when it will complete the last 10%. The last programme update received from BAM suggested substantial completion could be achieved by May 2024. Frustratingly, construction progress has been significantly behind BAM’s programme. After months of engagement with BAM, an updated programme was submitted on 18 July. This is currently under review by the employer’s representative to determine compliance with the contract. The employer’s representative is the independent body responsible for enforcing the contract. The programme outlines how BAM proposes to complete the more than 40,000 separate activities required to finish the project. Given this welcome level of detail, it will take time to verify and validate. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, has been clear that it will not be commenting on any details until the employer’s representative has determined it to be a compliant programme. This includes any potential updates to the substantial completion date. Once construction is complete, the hospital will be handed over to Children’s Health Ireland, CHI, for commissioning. This will ensure the hospital is ready for patients and staff and is expected to take at least six months. In advance of the handover, the pre-commissioning phase is already well advanced to ensure the smooth, safe and efficient transition of services to the new children’s hospital. This includes a significant body of work to integrate the three hospitals from a clinical and operational perspective, and the build of a digital hospital system and a new electronic healthcare record system. There remains a shared ambition among all parties to see the NCH opened as soon as possible for the benefit of children and families. To achieve this, the Minister for Health urges and expects BAM to resource and deliver against its own programme.	spk_3

I reiterate the importance of the completion of the children's hospital. The NPHDB, which entered into the construction contract with BAM on behalf of the State, is doing everything it can to hold the contractor accountable for its delivery programme. There is continuous engagement between officials within the Department of Health, the HSE, the NPHDB and Children's Health Ireland. The Secretary General of the Department has recently written to BAM setting out his expectations of BAM to complete the hospital without delay. The Minister has also directly engaged with the NPHDB, the CHI chairs and the chief officers on the project so that he can be assured everything possible is being done. It is to be welcomed that all stakeholders have expressed a shared ambition to achieve this completion date as quickly as possible. However, I will reiterate and pass on the Deputy's concerns to the Minister.	spk_5
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	National Children's Hospital	dbsect_3	I assure the Deputy this is an absolute priority for the Minister and the Government.

Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Health Services Staff	dbsect_4	I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister who, as the Deputy knows, cannot be here. It is important to acknowledge the vital role that section 39 and section 56 organisations and their staff play in our health and social care sectors.They continue to have a key role in providing services to people with disabilities, vulnerable children, older people and in other social care settings. The Government has a clear interest in ensuring the stability and sustainability of these services. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is the lead Department on this topic, as the majority of the organisations in question fall under its remit. Officials in the Department of Health are working closely with their colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on this matter. I am aware that they have been engaging extensively with the unions over recent months under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and have been supported in these discussions by officials from the Department of Health, the HSE and Tusla. This process culminated in an offer being made in line with that accepted by the same trade unions in other sectors across the wider public sector in recent months. The offer to workers in this sector amounted to a 5% increase in funding for pay, effective from November 2023, with 3% backdated to April 2023, and a commitment to re-engage with trade union representatives following the next public sector pay agreement. Unfortunately, this offer was not accepted by trade union representatives. It is disappointing that their members were not afforded the opportunity to vote on whether they wished to accept the 5% increase in pay funding and that the unions instead elected to ballot for industrial action. As such action would impact negatively on people who rely on these services, I urge all parties to work on resolving any disputes through the appropriate forums and uphold industrial peace in the interests of people who use our health service. An announcement regarding the result of the ballot and any plan for industrial action is expected to be made by the unions at a press conference on Monday, 25 September. As this is an ongoing industrial relations matter, it would be inappropriate to comment any further at this point.	spk_9
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Health Services Staff	dbsect_4	I reiterate that section 39 and section 56 organisations and their staff play a vital role in our healthcare and social care sectors. Officials in the Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are waiting on the result of the ballot. Officials from both Departments remain available to re-engage with unions at any time in an effort to bring this matter to a resolution. It is also important to remember that these are private employers and, as such, the Government has no authority or ability to change the terms and conditions of these workers. I appreciate that there are many organisations with staff who have similar or equivalent roles to workers in the HSE. However, it must be noted that there are more than 1,500 organisations within the sector. As the State is not the employer, we have a limited ability to verify the position. Attempting to increase the pay of workers in this sector by 9.5% may result in further disparity. The Government has little or no information in relation to many of these organisations and the terms and conditions of their employees. I reiterate that officials are ready to engage with unions at any time to resolve this issue.	spk_11

A key ambition of the national strategy for accelerating genetics and genomic medicine in Ireland is to build an excellent national genetics service. In 2023, the Government allocated €2.7 million to support the first year of implementation of this strategy. This funding supported the creation of a national office and expansion of front-line staff. To improve national genetic testing, we must first build a strong evidence base. To date, genetic testing has been administered at local level. Information is maintained by individual hospital sites and is not disaggregated by age cohort. Therefore, these data are not currently available centrally to support decision-making. It is a priority for the national office to address this challenge. The HSE has begun development of a national genetic testing directory. This directory will provide an accurate picture of current testing. It will also allow for improved national testing capacity in the future. Patients will receive faster, more accurate results without duplication of testing efforts. To inform improvements, the HSE commissioned a study into current national lab capacity. A report examining infrastructure and workforce was submitted to the HSE this week. Findings will be shared with the strategy’s implementation steering group. This will support evidenced-based decisions on genetic testing expansion and service improvements.	spk_41

That is maintained by individual hospitals. It is not disaggregated by age cohort. The data are not currently available centrally to support decision-making. It is a new office. In 2022, funding of €1.34 million was provided for the initial establishment, for example, of the national perinatal genomic service. In December 2022, the national strategy for accelerating genetics and genomic medicine in Ireland was launched. In budget 2023, €2.7 million was allocated to support the implementation of the strategy. The initial investment focused on establishing a national office for genetics and genomics and recruiting front-line staff and roles like the national director for the national office, the national bioinformatics director, a general manager and six genetic counsellors.

The objective of the HSE's 2023 national service plan is to bring critical care capacity to 352 beds, an additional 94 beds since 2020. Progress is being made on new elective hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Galway. Approval in principle at gate 1 of the public spending code was given to the sites at Galway and Cork at the end of 2022. The HSE is progressing the development of elective surgical hubs as quickly as possible and considering all options to expedite the delivery of these units in south Dublin, north Dublin, Galway, Cork, Waterford and Limerick. The first of these, in south Dublin, is expected to be operational before year end and the rest following next year. As well as this infrastructural investment, there has been a net growth in workforce of 21,910 whole-time equivalents, WTEs, an increase of 18% since 2020. In July 2023, the total workforce of the HSE stood at 141,722 WTEs. Health and social care workforce planning is a top priority for Government.

Based on the recommendations of the report, the HSE has identified the need to develop an updated and integrated model of care for transgender services, informed by the best evidence-based clinical care for individuals who express gender incongruence or dysphoria. The HSE is establishing a team to lead the development of an updated model of care for the treatment of gender dysphoria. As an initial step, the HSE has advertised for the post of a clinical lead for transgender services, who will develop the model of care and implementation plan for transgender care. The HSE will consult a wide range of stakeholders in the development of the new model of care, including those who use the services and advocacy groups. WPATH publishes the standards of care and ethical guidelines, which articulate a professional consensus about the psychiatric, psychological, medical and surgical management of gender dysphoria. The guidelines are designed to help professionals to understand the parameters within which they may offer assistance to those with gender dysphoria conditions.  The HSE is also working to identify an alternative pathway for children and young people experiencing protracted waiting times. Discussions are under way with the paediatric endocrinology service at Children's Health Ireland and also with a psychology service to work on an interim solution until a full, dedicated multidisciplinary service is established. I welcome the development of a model of care that will deliver a high-quality, seamless and integrated service for people with gender identity issues, in line with the programme for Government.	spk_78
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_7	I completely agree on the urgency. It is a priority of the Department of Health and HSE to provide a transgender healthcare service that is aligned with best practice internationally and meets the needs of children and adults. Dr. Cass from the National Health Service came to Ireland at the start of this year and presented the findings of her interim report to a wide range of stakeholders from the HSE, the Department, Children's Health Ireland, Ireland East Hospital Group and others involved in providing services. This facilitated a really constructive and informative discussion about the challenges in developing gender services in Ireland, given the limited availability of data and evidence on which to base the clinical approach and also the recruitment challenges.That meeting helped to inform the HSE on its next steps. I think that is what the Deputy is alluding to when she asks about timelines for developing the programme of work, including the development of a new model of care. It is important that supports are in place in psychology, psychiatry and endocrinology, especially for those with gender dysphoria. I will come back to the Deputy about timelines as I know the HSE is engaging in the next steps of this process.	spk_80
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_7	I thank the Deputy. On timelines and delivery, funding will be important.

Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_7	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. As the Deputy will be aware, cocaine is an addictive stimulant drug which can make people feel more alert, energetic and confident. Cocaine can cause a range of acute health-related problems and even sudden death. It is highly risky for anybody with high blood pressure or a heart condition. Even perfectly healthy young people can have a fit or heart attack after consuming too much cocaine. Repeated sniffing of cocaine powder irritates the nose and can cause a breakdown of nasal cartilage. Less than 7% of the population has ever used cocaine in their lifetime. Some 2% of the population has used cocaine in the past year. In 2022, 4,084 cases were treated for cocaine use. That is an increase of 800 or 26% on 2021. Cocaine accounts for 34% of all drug treatment cases. In partnership with the Ana Liffey Drug Project, the HSE has developed a harm reduction campaign focusing on the dangers of cocaine at  Drug prevention and education is a cornerstone of the national drugs strategy. I recently launched a €1.5 million drug education funding scheme, which supports evidence-based initiatives that engage with people who may be at risk of using drugs in a variety of contexts. I also recently announced funding of €500,000 to expand cocaine services. Enhancing access to drug services in the community and increasing awareness of the harms associated with drug use are a priority under the national drugs strategy. This demonstrates my commitment to a health-led response to drug use. We need to increase that funding and keep developing the education programme.	spk_84

It is important that we have an open and honest conversation about drug use. I have allocated €1.5 million for an education programme. It is the first time funding has ever been allocated to that and I want to expand on it. We have allocated €130 million to the HSE for addiction services. Again, I want to increase that. Education and an open, honest conversation are needed. It is not only those who are in addiction and going into the vicious circle of the criminal justice system who use cocaine. Some people take drugs on a Friday or Saturday night because they enjoy them. We need to raise awareness around the health and safety impacts of that. I recently attended the Electric Picnic with Professor Eamon Keenan and his team to raise awareness at the festival and help young people. It is key to know what are the emerging drugs coming into the country as they change all the time. It is important to raise awareness and inform people who may have a medical incident or who are worried about a friend so that they have somewhere to go. I absolutely agree with the Deputy's point about raising awareness of this issue.	spk_86
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_7	I also welcome the citizens' assembly and think the conversation will really start when it reports. In the meantime, I have allocated €850,000 for cocaine-related treatment. I also allocated €500,000 in June 2023 and €1.5 million for an education programme around drug use, for the first time. I have met drug and alcohol task forces and gone into detox units and services up and down the country. Funding is the issue. There are some fantastic programmes that need to be rolled out. However, we also need to make sure that whatever programmes are in place follow the right model and address the issues on the ground.That is why looking at emerging drug trends is really important. That is what the HSE is doing but I absolutely realise the importance of increasing funding and making sure it goes into services not just in urban areas, but also in rural Ireland. We need to look at emerging drugs and have an honest conversation about drug use in this country.	spk_89

The varicella vaccine is not currently included as part of the primary childhood immunisation programme but NIAC has recommended that the vaccine be included in the programme. Vaccines administered through the primary childhood immunisation programme are provided free of charge. The Department of Health asked HIQA to carry out a health technology assessment, HTA, on the varicella zoster vaccine, which was published in July 2023. HIQA found that there is clear and consistent evidence that the chickenpox vaccine is both safe and effective in preventing chickenpox and its complications. It also found that adding the chickenpox vaccine to the programme is likely to be cost effective. The office of the chief medical officer is considering the HTA findings and will make a recommendation to the Minister for Health which will inform the decision on the inclusion of the chickenpox vaccine in the primary childhood immunisation programme.	spk_91
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_7	Although varicella is typically a mild disease, there can be long-term skin scarring and serious complications requiring hospitalisation. Of the 58,000 cases of chickenpox that occur in Ireland every year, approximately one in every 250 will result in hospitalisation with the associated complications. The estimated effectiveness of one-dose and two-dose vaccination strategies was obtained from an overview of the reviews of the clinical effectiveness of the varicella vaccination. The HTA found that the introduction of one dose of the vaccine to the schedule would reduce severe disease, including hospitalisations, and overall occurrences. In addition, it was found that the introduction of two doses of the vaccine has the potential to further reduce the number of cases and eliminate chickenpox. I will certainly relay the Deputy's comments to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly. A decision will be made on this matter shortly.	spk_93

Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Health Services	dbsect_13	The HSE National Quality and Patient Safety Directorate has reviewed the interim Cass report and how it applies to clinical pathways in Ireland. Based on the recommendations of the report, the HSE has identified the need to develop an updated and integrated model of care for transgender services, informed by the best evidence-based clinical care for individuals who express gender incongruence or dysphoria. The HSE is establishing a team to lead the development of an updated model of care for the treatment of gender dysphoria. As an initial step, the HSE has advertised for the post of a clinical lead for transgender services, who will develop the model of care and implementation plan for transgender care. The HSE will consult a wide range of stakeholders in the development of the new model of care, including those who use the services and advocacy groups. WPATH publishes the standards of care and ethical guidelines, which articulate a professional consensus about the psychiatric, psychological, medical and surgical management of gender dysphoria. The guidelines are designed to help professionals to understand the parameters within which they may offer assistance to those with gender dysphoria conditions.  The HSE is also working to identify an alternative pathway for children and young people experiencing protracted waiting times. Discussions are under way with the paediatric endocrinology service at Children's Health Ireland and also with a psychology service to work on an interim solution until a full, dedicated multidisciplinary service is established. I welcome the development of a model of care that will deliver a high-quality, seamless and integrated service for people with gender identity issues, in line with the programme for Government.	spk_78
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Health Services	dbsect_13	I completely agree on the urgency. It is a priority of the Department of Health and HSE to provide a transgender healthcare service that is aligned with best practice internationally and meets the needs of children and adults. Dr. Cass from the National Health Service came to Ireland at the start of this year and presented the findings of her interim report to a wide range of stakeholders from the HSE, the Department, Children's Health Ireland, Ireland East Hospital Group and others involved in providing services. This facilitated a really constructive and informative discussion about the challenges in developing gender services in Ireland, given the limited availability of data and evidence on which to base the clinical approach and also the recruitment challenges.That meeting helped to inform the HSE on its next steps. I think that is what the Deputy is alluding to when she asks about timelines for developing the programme of work, including the development of a new model of care. It is important that supports are in place in psychology, psychiatry and endocrinology, especially for those with gender dysphoria. I will come back to the Deputy about timelines as I know the HSE is engaging in the next steps of this process.	spk_80
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Health Services	dbsect_13	I thank the Deputy. On timelines and delivery, funding will be important. The delivery of this service is part of the Estimates discussions that are happening at the moment for the upcoming budget. We will keep the Deputy updated about this important issue.	spk_82
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Misuse of Drugs	dbsect_14	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. As the Deputy will be aware, cocaine is an addictive stimulant drug which can make people feel more alert, energetic and confident. Cocaine can cause a range of acute health-related problems and even sudden death. It is highly risky for anybody with high blood pressure or a heart condition. Even perfectly healthy young people can have a fit or heart attack after consuming too much cocaine. Repeated sniffing of cocaine powder irritates the nose and can cause a breakdown of nasal cartilage. Less than 7% of the population has ever used cocaine in their lifetime. Some 2% of the population has used cocaine in the past year. In 2022, 4,084 cases were treated for cocaine use. That is an increase of 800 or 26% on 2021. Cocaine accounts for 34% of all drug treatment cases. In partnership with the Ana Liffey Drug Project, the HSE has developed a harm reduction campaign focusing on the dangers of cocaine at  Drug prevention and education is a cornerstone of the national drugs strategy. I recently launched a €1.5 million drug education funding scheme, which supports evidence-based initiatives that engage with people who may be at risk of using drugs in a variety of contexts. I also recently announced funding of €500,000 to expand cocaine services. Enhancing access to drug services in the community and increasing awareness of the harms associated with drug use are a priority under the national drugs strategy. This demonstrates my commitment to a health-led response to drug use. We need to increase that funding and keep developing the education programme.	spk_84
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Misuse of Drugs	dbsect_14	The work of the citizens' assembly is timely. It will report at the end of the year. It is important that we have an open and honest conversation about drug use. I have allocated €1.5 million for an education programme. It is the first time funding has ever been allocated to that and I want to expand on it. We have allocated €130 million to the HSE for addiction services. Again, I want to increase that. Education and an open, honest conversation are needed. It is not only those who are in addiction and going into the vicious circle of the criminal justice system who use cocaine. Some people take drugs on a Friday or Saturday night because they enjoy them. We need to raise awareness around the health and safety impacts of that. I recently attended the Electric Picnic with Professor Eamon Keenan and his team to raise awareness at the festival and help young people. It is key to know what are the emerging drugs coming into the country as they change all the time. It is important to raise awareness and inform people who may have a medical incident or who are worried about a friend so that they have somewhere to go. I absolutely agree with the Deputy's point about raising awareness of this issue.	spk_86
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Misuse of Drugs	dbsect_14	I also welcome the citizens' assembly and think the conversation will really start when it reports. In the meantime, I have allocated €850,000 for cocaine-related treatment. I also allocated €500,000 in June 2023 and €1.5 million for an education programme around drug use, for the first time. I have met drug and alcohol task forces and gone into detox units and services up and down the country. Funding is the issue. There are some fantastic programmes that need to be rolled out. However, we also need to make sure that whatever programmes are in place follow the right model and address the issues on the ground.That is why looking at emerging drug trends is really important. That is what the HSE is doing but I absolutely realise the importance of increasing funding and making sure it goes into services not just in urban areas, but also in rural Ireland. We need to look at emerging drugs and have an honest conversation about drug use in this country.	spk_89
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Vaccination Programme	dbsect_15	The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, which continues to revise its recommendations having regard to the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in immunisation. The varicella vaccine is not currently included as part of the primary childhood immunisation programme but NIAC has recommended that the vaccine be included in the programme. Vaccines administered through the primary childhood immunisation programme are provided free of charge. The Department of Health asked HIQA to carry out a health technology assessment, HTA, on the varicella zoster vaccine, which was published in July 2023. HIQA found that there is clear and consistent evidence that the chickenpox vaccine is both safe and effective in preventing chickenpox and its complications. It also found that adding the chickenpox vaccine to the programme is likely to be cost effective. The office of the chief medical officer is considering the HTA findings and will make a recommendation to the Minister for Health which will inform the decision on the inclusion of the chickenpox vaccine in the primary childhood immunisation programme.	spk_91
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-09-21	dail	33	Vaccination Programme	dbsect_15	Although varicella is typically a mild disease, there can be long-term skin scarring and serious complications requiring hospitalisation. Of the 58,000 cases of chickenpox that occur in Ireland every year, approximately one in every 250 will result in hospitalisation with the associated complications. The estimated effectiveness of one-dose and two-dose vaccination strategies was obtained from an overview of the reviews of the clinical effectiveness of the varicella vaccination. The HTA found that the introduction of one dose of the vaccine to the schedule would reduce severe disease, including hospitalisations, and overall occurrences. In addition, it was found that the introduction of two doses of the vaccine has the potential to further reduce the number of cases and eliminate chickenpox. I will certainly relay the Deputy's comments to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly. A decision will be made on this matter shortly.	spk_93

I look forward to their support as the Bill is considered further on Committee Stage. The issue of the further regulation of nicotine inhaling products has been raised. I share these concerns and it is an area on which the Minister for Health and I would like to see Ireland take a leading role in the future. lf we want to tackle the usage of nicotine inhaling products by our young people, the first and most important step is to prohibit their sale to persons under the age of 18. That is what the Bill is doing. We are late with this ban, as Deputies Shortall, Gino Kenny and others mentioned, because the majority of EU countries already have it in place. The Bill has been notified at EU level and the required standstill period is set to end on 8 September. We will be able to bring this measure into operation early in the next term. lf further amendments are made to the Bill those amendments will have to be notified at EU level and a new three-month, or potentially a six-month standstill period, will begin. The Minister for Health does not wish to wait any longer than is absolutely necessary to implement the prohibition on the sale of these products to our children. I support him on this. Successful actions on public health problems such as tobacco usage or alcohol consumption require multiple evidence-based interventions in order to affect usage. Each aspect of the product, including pricing, advertising, packaging and sale need to be addressed in order to have a successful impact. In addition, as several Deputies mentioned, it is important that any law that is made is reviewed for effectiveness. I am also conscious that e-cigarettes are already regulated at EU level by the tobacco products directive and that a new proposal for a directive is expected in 2024. It is important that we recognise when it is better to act nationally and when such action would be more effective at EU level as part of a comprehensive strategy. It is clear from the Deputies' comments that there is a range of opinions on how best to regulate the packaging, flavours and advertising of these products and on how we take into consideration the relative harm of these products compared to combustible tobacco products. In this context, the Minister and I have asked officials to examine options for the development of further and comprehensive legislation on nicotine inhaling products such as e-cigarettes. This will begin with a call for evidence so that we can ascertain the views and the public health evidence that exist on these products and their usage. We will take into consideration that while these products have no benefit to young people or to non-smokers, and are not recommended by the HSE for smoking cessation, they were used by one in five Irish smokers who successfully quit cigarettes last year.  These considerations are complex but what is not complex is that we need to ban the sale of these products to those under the age of 18 as soon as possible. We also need to introduce our licensing system to ensure that we know who is selling these products and so that we can enforce compliance with the new measures we are introducing. Deputy Alan Farrell mentioned that we should use the plain packaging law that applies to cigarettes and extend it to nicotine inhaling products. The purpose of that complex legislation was to remove all elements from packaging other than the prescribed EU health warnings, and to specify in detail how the remaining information must be displayed. That law cannot simply be applied across to packaging for nicotine inhaling products. In addition, the EU has competence for health warnings on e-cigarettes because it already legislated for these in the tobacco products directive. Several Deputies queried the current level of regulation on e-cigarettes. I want to make it clear that there is already substantial regulation of e-cigarettes under the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016.This includes mandatory quality and safety requirements, maximum nicotine content levels, health warnings and other labelling requirements and an EU-wide ban on the advertising of e-cigarettes online, on television and radio and in print or non-trade publications. Several Deputies mentioned products labelled wrongly in relation to their nicotine content. These products should be reported to the Environmental Health Service as this is a contravention of the requirements of the 2016 EU regulations. Several Deputies mentioned the need to increase support for smokers trying to quit. Last year, VAT was removed from all nicotine replacement therapy products and funding for the HSE's Quit programme reached €15.7 million, up from €11.8 million in 2017. In addition, in February this year, the HSE announced the roll-out of free stop smoking medication such as nicotine replacement therapy products to anyone using the HSE Quit service. I would encourage anyone thinking about quitting smoking to make use of these services. A number of Deputies mentioned the role of social media influencers in promoting the use of nicotine inhaling products. This is a difficult area as these promotions do not fall under traditional legal definitions of advertising. Any action in this regard will require engagement with the Media Commission, which is responsible for the regulation of this area. A number of the Deputies mentioned the environmental impact of disposable nicotine inhaling products. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ossian Smyth, launched a public consultation on disposable vapes on 1 June this year. That consultation is open for submissions for an eight-week period until 27 July. The purpose of the consultation is to examine what action should be taken from an environmental perspective. The proposed policy options include a ban on disposable vaping devices or a deposit and return system for disposable vaping devices. I look forward to the results of the consultation and the next steps. Other queries arose that I am happy to answer. The Bill applies to online sales the same as to traditional sales and persons selling these products online will require a licence as if they had a physical premises. The purchase of a nicotine inhaling product by an adult for a child is prohibited by this Bill. The percentage of non-smokers or never smokers who vape has consistently been found to be approximately 1% of the population in our Healthy Ireland surveys and the figure from the 2022 survey was 1.2%. The ban on the sale of these products to our children is our urgent objective. The other issues in relation to packaging and flavours and other restrictions will be the subject of further legislation after we have the evidence to support policy change. I thank Deputies once again for their contributions on the introduction of this Bill to this House and look forward to further debate on Committee Stage and ultimately enacting this important legislation.	spk_443

Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-06-13	dail	33	Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill 2023: Second Stage	dbsect_11	"I move:""That the Bill be now read a Second Time.""I am pleased to be here on behalf of the Minister for Health to introduce the Public Health (Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill to this House. The primary objective of the Bill is to reduce the health harms of smoking through reducing the use of tobacco products and nicotine inhaling products, especially by young people. The Bill will achieve these objectives through the introduction of a licensing system for the retail sale of these products, restrictions on sale and advertising, and strengthening the powers of the enforcement authority, namely, the environmental health service of the HSE. Tobacco smoking is addictive and lethal. There is scientific consensus that smoking kills one out of every two smokers. According to international analysis, smoking is the risk factor that drives the most death and disability combined in Ireland. Our own data tells us it kills more than 12 of our people every day, or 4,500 per year. In addition to the death toll, combustible tobacco products also cause a vast range of illnesses, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, aneurysms, stroke and 16 types of cancer. The World Health Organization has estimated 14% of Alzheimer's disease cases worldwide are attributable to smoking. Smoking during childhood and adolescence also causes both reduced lung function and impaired lung growth. There remains an absence of scientific consensus on the health harms of nicotine inhaling products such as e-cigarettes. What is generally agreed is that nicotine inhaling products are not harmless, that it is likely that they are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes and that further research is needed to establish possible long-term health effects. The Health Research Board reviewed the evidence on e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco products in October 2020. Its main findings were that: e-cigarettes are not harmless but may represent a reduction in harm relative to smoking; more research is needed to establish the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco products; e-cigarette use is associated with an increased likelihood of smoking in adolescents; and e-cigarettes are as effective as approved nicotine replacement therapies for smoking cessation at six months. More research is needed to establish their safety and effectiveness in the longer term. Since July 2014 the World Health Organization has recommended sales of e-cigarettes to minors be prohibited as there is sufficient evidence of the potential for adolescent nicotine exposure to have long-term consequences for brain development. In addition, and as confirmed by the Health Research Board evidence, such a prohibition would prevent minors from becoming exposed to nicotine with the risk that this may act as a gateway to the use of tobacco products. We have made good progress in reducing our smoking rates from the very high levels in the past but there is still much to do. The 2022 Healthy Ireland survey data tells us 18% of our adult population smoke, with 14% smoking daily and 4% smoking occasionally. Our latest Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey from 2018, shows 5% of children aged between ten and 17 years smoke monthly or more frequently and 11% have smoked at least once. Usage of e-cigarettes among adults was 6% in 2022, according to the Healthy Ireland survey, with 3% daily use and 3% occasional use. Among children, the 2018 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey showed 9% had used an e-cigarette within the last 30 days and 22% had tried one at some point. This Bill will introduce further restrictions on tobacco products, such as introducing the requirement for an annual licence, banning their sale through self-service and banning their sale from temporary or pop-up shops. We are also, for the first time, introducing Irish legislation on nicotine inhaling products, such as e-cigarettes. These products are currently regulated in Ireland through the EU tobacco products directive. This Bill will introduce measures additional to those required at EU level, including an annual licensing requirement to sell these products, a ban on the sale of these products to minors, a ban on the sale of these products and tobacco products by minors, with limited exceptions, a ban on the sale of these products and tobacco products at events for children and additional restrictions on the advertising. I will take Deputies through the Bill to outline the content of each section. The Bill is divided into five parts. Part 1 is titled ""Preliminary and General"" and contains sections 1 to 9, inclusive. Section 1 sets out the Short Title of the Bill and provides that the Minister for Health may provide for different lead-in times for different sections. Longer lead-in times will be provided for certain provisions to ensure businesses will be given plenty of time to prepare for compliance with the new requirements in the Bill. In particular, the new requirement to apply for and obtain an annual licence to continue to sell these products. Section 2 deals with interpretation and defines some of the terms used in the Bill. ""Nicotine inhaling product"" is defined here and it includes any part of the product such as a cartridge attached to the product or any substance used in the product. This comprehensive definition means a licence will be required for the sale of any element of these products. This section also provides that sale by retail includes online sales. Section 3 ensures the Act will not apply to medical devices such as those with nicotine which may be prescribed for smokers to assist them to quit smoking. Section 4 provides that companies and corporate bodies shall be deemed to be ordinarily resident at their registered office or principal place of business. Section 5 empowers the Minister for Health of the day to make regulations as provided for under the Act. Section 6 is a standard provision dealing with expenses. Section 7 is a standard provision dealing with the service of documents under the Act. Section 8 provides that where a person is sold a tobacco product or nicotine inhaling product from somewhere outside the State, but that product is despatched within the State, the sale is deemed to have taken place within the State and therefore will be subject to the provisions of the Act. Section 9 repeals certain sections of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 and certain regulations. Sections 5A and 37 of the 2002 Act are being repealed. These sections deal with the Register of Tobacco Retailers. As the register is being replaced by the licensing system provided for in this Bill, these provisions will no longer be necessary. Section 45 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 prohibits the sale of tobacco products to persons under 18 years of age. This prohibition is being re-enacted at section 29 of this Bill. It will now sit alongside a ban on the sale of nicotine inhaling products to persons aged under 18 and will provide for updated defences for retailers. Section 9(2) revokes regulations from 2009 on the Register of Tobacco Retailers and the requirement that tobacco retailers have a sign on the counter. These regulations will need to be replaced as the Register of Tobacco Retailers will now be replaced by a licensing system. Section 9(2) also revokes the Public Health (Tobacco) (Self Service Vending Machines) Regulations 2009, which provided for the rules governing the sale of tobacco products through self-service vending machines. These regulations will no longer be required as the sale of both tobacco products and nicotine inhaling products by self-service, including through vending machines, is being prohibited in this Bill. Part 2 of the Bill is titled ""Licence for sale of tobacco products or nicotine inhaling products"" and contains sections 10 to 23, inclusive. Section 10 sets out the application process for an annual licence to sell either tobacco products, nicotine inhaling products or both. Under the current registration system for tobacco retailers, a once-off registration, with a fee of €50, means a retailer can sell tobacco products from any number of premises for any length of time. Under the new system, an annual licence for each premises is required.The fee will be determined by the Minister for Health. Section 10 also provides that a licence will not be issued for sales from a temporary or moveable premises other than a commercial passenger ship. This means that pop-up shops, for example at music festivals, will not be licensed to sell tobacco products or nicotine inhaling products. Section 11 provides for the determination of the licence. The environmental health service of the HSE must refuse to grant a licence if the application is not made correctly, if the applicant has been convicted of two or more serious offences under tobacco control law, or if the applicant provides false or misleading information. Section 12 provides for the issue of the licence and sets out the information that will be contained on the licence. Section 13 provides that a licence will be issued for a 12-month period. Section 14 provides for the renewal of a licence. Section 15 provides for an appeal to the District Court if an application for a licence, or for renewal of a licence, is refused. Section 16 provides that a licence holder may apply for a copy of a licence if the original has been lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed. Section 17 provides that the Minister may prescribe fees in relation to the licensing system. Section 18 provides that a licence may be revoked if the licensee has committed two or more serious tobacco control offences, or no longer holds a valid tax clearance certificate, or provides false or misleading information. Section 19 provides that a licensee can make representations to the environmental health service in relation to the decision to revoke a licence, and section 20 provides for an appeal to the District Court against a revocation. Section 21 sets out the duty to display a licence. Section 22 describes the register of licences to be held by the environmental health service, and section 23 sets out that a licensee must notify changes in information to the environmental health service. Part 3 is titled Certain Offences and contains sections 24 to 31, inclusive. Section 24 makes it an offence to sell tobacco products or nicotine inhaling products without a licence. Section 25 prohibits the sale of tobacco products or nicotine inhaling products by self-service. Section 26 provides that tobacco products or nicotine inhaling products cannot be sold by a minor. The exception is a close relative of the licensee who is over 16 years of age. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that these products are not further normalised for young retail workers and to avoid such workers coming under peer pressure to sell these products to other minors. Section 27 re-enacts the ban on the sale of tobacco products to minors and applies that to nicotine inhaling products. It shall be a defence for a retailer if the purchaser produces a form of identification such as a passport or age card. Section 28 prohibits the sale of tobacco products or nicotine inhaling products at events aimed at children or at events where children are in the majority. Section 29 prohibits the advertising of nicotine inhaling products on school grounds or within 200 m of the perimeter of a school; on a public service vehicle such as a taxi, bus, train or tram; at a train station or bus station; or at a bus stop or tram stop. Section 30 provides that it is an offence to advertise nicotine inhaling products in a cinema except around a film that has been classified as suitable for adults. Section 31 provides that it is an offence to display a licence that has been suspended, revoked or has expired. Part 4 is titled Enforcement and Compliance and contains sections 32 and 33. Section 32 provides a statutory backing for the environmental health service’s programme of test purchasing. This is an enforcement tool used by the environmental health service, in which persons under 18 attempt to purchase tobacco products. Section 33 provides that the environmental health service may publish a list of persons on whom a fine or other penalty has been imposed by a court under the Act. Part 5 is titled Penalties and Proceedings and contains sections 34 to 40, inclusive. Section 34 sets out the penalties for offences under the Bill. Section 35 is a standard section providing that it is a defence for a person to show they made all reasonable efforts to comply with the requirements of the Act. Section 36 provides that officers of a company or like persons are liable for offences committed by a body corporate. Section 37 relates to the certification of evidence in the case of samples examined in a designated laboratory. Section 38 provides for the duration of the periods for which a licence will be suspended by a court. The duration depends on the seriousness of the offence committed, whether it is a first offence and whether the offence is taken on summary prosecution or on indictment. The minimum suspension period is not less than two days and the maximum is 12 months. Section 39 provides that summary proceedings may be brought and prosecuted by the HSE. Section 40 provides that the offences of the sale of tobacco products and the sale of nicotine inhaling products by self-service, along with the sale of both products at events for children, may be prosecuted within 12 months.  Part 6 is titled Amendment of Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 and contains sections 41 to 48, inclusive. Section 41 inserts necessary definitions into the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002. Section 42 amends section 5 of the 2002 Act to align the penalties for the sale by self-service of tobacco products with that of nicotine inhaling products. Section 43 provides for electronic service of documents. Section 44 makes a number of amendments to section 43 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, the most important of which is to repeal the provision that allows for the sale of tobacco products through self- service vending machines. Sections 45 and 46 amend the 2002 Act to ensure the powers, functions and appointment of authorised officers applies to this Act. This also ensures those powers apply to nicotine inhaling products as well as to tobacco products. Section 47 amends the Act of 2002 to include the offence of forgery of documents in this Act. Section 48 adds new sections 54 to 57, inclusive, to the 2002 Act. This will provide the environmental health service with the additional enforcement tools of compliance notices, prohibition notices and fixed payment notices throughout all of tobacco control law. It also provides for the procedure to be used if material that may be subject to legal privilege is at issue in an investigation by the environmental health service.  Part 7 is titled Miscellaneous and contains sections 49 and 50. Section 49 inserts nicotine inhaling products into the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act, alongside tobacco products, so that the Act is disapplied from them. Section 50 includes references to this Act in the tobacco products directive regulations of 2016. I look forward to all of the Deputies' contributions on this important law, which is designed to reduce health harms from smoking and drive down the uptake of tobacco products and nicotine inhaling products, particularly by our children. I commend the Bill to the House."	spk_121

The sexual health strategy is a core priority for Healthy Ireland and for the Government. Additional funding of approximately €4 million was allocated to sexual health between budgets 2022 and 2023. The recent independent review by Crowe Ireland of the first National Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020 identifies some key successes. These include: expanding free access to contraception through the free contraception scheme for women and national condom distribution service; the introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP, for HIV prevention and joining the HIV fast-track cities programme; introducing a nationwide free home sexually transmitted infection, STI, testing service in 2022; additional data and information through surveys and research; developing a wide range of educational resources; public engagement and communications campaigns; the  The review includes 32 recommendations to inform the next strategy.

Work on a refreshed national sexual health strategy was delayed due to Covid, but commenced earlier this year. The first meeting of the policy development group is scheduled for July. The renewed strategy will build on the priorities of its predecessor. Given the rapid development and change, it is likely the remit of the strategy will be widened.

As the Deputy knows, Ireland established a national HIV PrEP programme in November 2019. PrEP clinics are provided within 13 of the free STI clinics and 17 private GP providers are approved to prescribe free PrEP medication. In 2022, 4,314 individuals had their PrEP eligibility approved via the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS and 3,388 individuals had a PrEP prescription filled at least once, of whom 1,240 had their first ever prescriptions. There have been changes to the international guidelines. These widened the access criteria for PrEP. Consideration is now being given to incorporate the resulting unmet demand.

Families have unique insights that are a valuable resource to those involved in developing addiction services and interventions. Facilitating their involvement in the development and design of services is a core objective of our drugs policy. In 2022, the Department of Health allocated €280,000 in additional recurring funding to the HSE to support family services. This funding was to develop and broaden the range of peer-led, mutual aid and family support programmes, in accordance with best practice. It included an allocation of €70,000 in recurring funding to Louth and Meath, as part of community healthcare organisation, CHO, 8. In the same year, the Department established the community services enhancement fund, with annual funding of €2 million on a recurring basis for community-based drug services. Of this allocation, a further €80,000 in recurring funding was prioritised for Louth and Meath as part of our commitment to support the implementation of the recommendations on drugs services from the scoping report on community safety and well-being in Drogheda. I understand an independent evaluation of community and voluntary drug services was commissioned by the north-eastern regional drugs and alcohol task force. The conclusions and recommendations arising from that report and the HSE review of addiction services in counties Louth and Meath will inform the development of a roadmap for drug services in the Louth-Meath area.

and— the Minister for Health is in discussions with Government colleagues on a proposal to expedite the rapid construction and delivery of 1,500 additional acute beds across the country, using modern methods of construction, including modular construction;further recognises that:— the 2023 Waiting List Action Plan was published in March 2023, and many of our individual hospitals have delivered impressive reductions in both their waiting lists and waiting times, with for example, Louth County Hospital, University Hospital Waterford, and Portiuncula University Hospital having reduced the number of patients waiting over 18 months for an Outpatients Department appointment by 97 per cent, 55 per cent and 38 per cent respectively, in the last year;— the HSE is currently working to replicate this positive performance across the entire hospital system;— in Budget 2023, funding of €443 million was allocated to tackle waiting lists, and this includes €123 million funding for the HSE to progress longer-term reforms to sustainably enhance capacity, €240 million funding for the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund for additional short-term measures to address acute scheduled care waiting list backlogs exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the remaining €80 million will be focused on alleviating various waiting lists in community and primary care;— 2022 was the first year that waiting list numbers fell since 2015;— progress is being made, and in 2022 the numbers waiting over the maximum wait time targets of 10 to 12 weeks, fell by 11 per cent, which is 56,000 people, and since the pandemic peaks in 2020/21 to the end of April 2023, there has been a reduction of 135,000, or 21 per cent, in the numbers of people waiting above these targets; — under the 2023 Waiting List Action Plan, our health service aims to treat and remove circa 1.66 million patients from the lists, resulting in a projected reduction of just over 10 per cent by year-end;— productive engagement is ongoing with the Private Hospitals Association, to secure additional capacity both in the short- and medium-term to support scheduled and unscheduled care;— plans are advancing on three new Elective Hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Galway, that will provide significant additional capacity, and combined they will cater for up to 977,700 patients/procedures annually; and— the HSE is developing a multi-year urgent and emergency care improvement programme to deliver sustainable improvements to unscheduled care, most of which currently occurs in the Emergency Department; andfurther acknowledges that:— the Department of Health is working closely with the HSE on developing the plan for expansion of community care and other measures which will reduce unnecessary attendances and improve discharge supports, such as home support and residential care;— this Government is committed to a 'home first' approach to health service provision, and the Enhanced Community Care (ECC) Programme delivers healthcare reoriented towards general practice, primary care, and community-based services that prevents admissions to acute hospitals;— the Government has allocated significant resources with annual funding of €195 million provisioned to the ECC Programme to enable recruitment of 3,500 additional staff, and with service delivery provided through Community Healthcare Networks (CHNs) and Community Specialist Teams (CSTs), that commitment will continue into future years;— significant progress is being made, with 91 of the 96 CHNs and 44 of the 60 CSTs now established, and 2,600 staff already recruited to the programme, with the balance of recruitment and establishment of the remaining teams targeted for 2023; — the nationwide GP Access to Diagnostics programme, began accepting referrals in January 2021;— 251,601 diagnostics were completed last year, which exceeded the 2022 target of 195,000 scans, and of this, 115,477 community radiology scans have been completed to date;— Primary Care Centres (PCCs) are an essential part of the Government's significant investment and nationally there are 167 PCCs, two of which opened in 2023, with a further 13 currently in construction, and 10 due to open in 2023;— there are approximately 3,500 general practitioners (GPs) working in Ireland currently, 2,500 of whom hold a General Medical Scheme contract with the HSE, and over 500 further GPs hold contracts for screening or vaccinations services; — under the upcoming Strategic Review of General Practice, consideration will be given to the possible role of HSE-employed GPs, as part of a wider examination of the GP capacity issue; — there has been an increase of almost 30 per cent in the number of first-year nursing places in Irish Higher Education Institutions over the period 2014-2021, from 1,570 to 2,032; — in July 2022, Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Simon Harris TD, and Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly TD, announced an agreement with Irish Medical Schools to phase in an increase of 200 additional Irish/European Union medicine student places over the next five years; and — discussions are ongoing between the Department of Health and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovationand Science, regarding the expansion of student places across health-related disciplines.""I welcome the opportunity to address the House on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, on the issues raised by the Deputies tabling the motion. The Minister is unavoidably away because he is attending the World Health Assembly in Geneva. One of the issues raised was how best to underpin the framework for safe nurse staffing and skill mix. A question asked the world over is how to determine the number of nurses and healthcare assistants required to deliver care in various healthcare settings. The framework for safe nurse staffing and skill mix is an evidence-based approach to determine safe staffing and skill mix levels for nursing and healthcare assistants in the Irish healthcare service and it has been in development since 2014. The framework is being developed in three phases. A policy on phase 1, medical and surgical care settings, was launched in 2018. A policy on phase 2, adult emergency care settings, was launched by the Minister, Deputy Donnelly in 2022. Phase 3 of the framework is in the process of being developed for general and non-acute care settings and includes long-term residential care settings for older persons, community care settings, and step-down and rehabilitation settings. Phase 3 of the framework in long-term residential care settings for older persons is currently being tested in eight pilot sites. When the evidence and the recommendations from this pilot are available, phase 3 will be developed into a national policy for broader implementation. Responsibility for the implementation of the framework policies is given to the HSE and this is overseen by a safe staffing lead. To date, €25 million has been allocated to implement phase 1 in model 4 hospitals. This funding provided for almost 870 whole-time equivalents, WTEs, including both registered nurses and healthcare assistants. Some 92% of these positions have been filled with the remainder expected to be filled later this year. The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, recently announced funding of €25 million to continue the implementation of phase 1 in model 3 and model 2 hospitals, which will provide for an additional 854 whole-time equivalents in these hospitals. Some €6.2 million has been allocated for phase 2 to provide for an extra 101 whole-time equivalent registered nurses in emergency departments throughout the country and 46% of these positions are now filled. The framework for safe nurse staffing and skill mix is recognised around the world as highly effective, with other countries now looking to Ireland. I understand the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has recently spoken with several academic experts who believe the framework is one of the best, if not the best, model for determining staffing levels. Since 2020, approximately half the required extra posts have been created, including both nursing and healthcare assistants. The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has spoken with nurses about the challenges that arise when the framework is not fully implemented, including issues of cross cover. However, where the framework is in place, it is making a big difference.  There is limited evidence to show that legislation makes it safer for patients or impacts implementation in a positive way. The advice the Minister received from international experts in safe staffing is that now is not the right time for Ireland to underpin the framework with legislation. The priority should be on implementation and development of the framework in other areas, especially in community care. The Office of the Chief Nursing Officer, CNO, will, however, keep this under review. As regards waiting lists, as Deputies will be aware, the Department of Health, HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, published the 2023 waiting list action plan on 7 March this year. This forms the next stage of the multi-annual approach to sustainably reduce and reform hospital waiting lists and waiting times. The plan allocates €363 million in funding to the HSE and NTPF to reduce hospital waiting lists by 10% this year, to continue implementing reforms, and to continue momentum towards achieving Sláintecare maximum waiting times of ten weeks for new outpatient appointments and 12 weeks for procedures. This is building on the reductions in the waiting lists achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021 and again in 2022. Although the initial target for 2022 was not achieved as a result of continuous Covid-19 waves and significant pressures on unscheduled care, it must be acknowledged that 2022 was the first annual decrease in hospital waiting lists since 2015. The agreed cross-party objective is to have nobody waiting longer than the Sláintecare targets of ten weeks for outpatient departments and 12 weeks inpatient day care gastrointestinal scope. In 2022, the numbers waiting over the Sláintecare targets fell by 11%, or 56,000 people, and there was a 24% reduction since the pandemic peak.The Government fully acknowledges the distress and inconvenience for patients and their families when elective procedures are cancelled particularly for clinically urgent procedures. While every effort is made to avoid cancellation or postponement of planned procedures the HSE has advised that this can occur for a variety of reasons, including capacity issues due to increased scheduled and unscheduled care demand. The HSE has confirmed to the Department of Health that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The Department of Health is already developing a comprehensive health and social care workforce strategy and action plan and planning projection model. The health and social care planning projection model will provide demand and supply projections of numbers required in medicine, nursing and other areas spanning short-, medium- and long-term time horizons. Work on the planning projection model is due to be completed in quarter 3 of 2023. Building on the 2023 plan, this will enable detailed planning for 2024 onwards. The expected result and ultimate objective of this work is the development of scenario-based projections of health and social care workforce supply and demand. These projections will inform a strategy, action plan and set of recommendations for ongoing strategic health and social care workforce planning. In recent years, significant investment has been made through the winter and national service capital plans. This investment, while responding to the immediate demands of the Covid-19 pandemic through initiatives and alternative pathways, also assisted in building bed capacity. Between 1 January 2020 and 16 March 2023, 970 new acute hospital beds have opened nationally. Of these, 541 were opened in 2020, 272 were opened in 2021, and 157 were opened in 2022. There are 209 beds now profiled for delivery in 2023 giving a total of 1,179 beds. Adult critical care capacity is now 323 beds. This represents a very significant increase of 65 beds, or 25%, over the 2020 baseline of 258 beds. To put that in perspective, we had a total net increase of 18 beds in the three years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The HSE plans to add a further 29 beds in 2023, bringing capacity to 352 beds by year end. This includes 20 beds already funded and nine beds included in the national service plan for 2023. Currently, the HSE is examining potential capital projects to deliver remaining critical care beds under phase 2 of the strategic plan for critical care through the development of new-build capacity at five prioritised sites, subject to necessary approval processes. These sites include Beaumont Hospital, St James’s Hospital, the Mater hospital, St Vincent’s University Hospital and Cork University Hospital."	spk_201
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-05-17	dail	33	Central Statistics Office Sexual Violence Survey 2022: Statements	dbsect_10	"I welcome the publication of the recent results of the sexual violence survey by the CSO, following a Government request to that office to carry out this really important piece of work. The publication of this survey represents a new baseline, setting out the levels of sexual violence in Ireland. Additional detail will be published in the coming months around the prevalence of sexual violence in adulthood and childhood, attitudes to sexual violence, and the lived experience of those who suffered sexual violence, which will be of enormous benefit in the development of appropriate policy responses. It is also important to note, as alluded to by my colleagues, that the CSO intends to conduct the survey again in ten years' time. A key element in being able to understand and interpret the data is appreciating the range of experiences captured in the term ""sexual violence"". Sexual violence covers any sexual act which takes place without freely-given consent or where someone forces or manipulates another person into unwanted sexual activity. It covers experiences that can have a marked or powerful effect on those that experience them in their lifetime. This definition is based on national and international research including the Istanbul Convention, the EU survey on gender-based violence against women and other forms of interpersonal violence, the Luxembourg guidelines and relevant research from the United Nations, UN. I join the Minister for Justice, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, in thanking everyone involved in this survey for taking part and helping to produce this very important piece of work. This survey required explicit questions to be asked of participants on very sensitive topics. For those who have not had experience of sexual violence in their lifetime, it may have generated unease while for those who have experienced sexual violence, it may have generated fear and distress. It is important to acknowledge the fact that so many people shared their personal experiences in this survey, which has resulted in this important body of work. The true prevalence of sexual violence is difficult to identify but a survey may be a close proxy to the true prevalence level if it is collected in a way that reduces the risk of under-reporting, among other things. The CSO worked to minimise this risk principally by ensuring that the questionnaire met best international standards and by providing a confidential setting for the conduct of the survey so that respondents could safely and confidentially share their experiences of sexual violence at a time and location of their choosing. While there is much information in the publication, some of the key points have already been outlined by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Harris. One thing that is very clear is that the incidence of sexual violence is very high. The survey also points to worrying experiences of sexual violence during childhood. It shows that one in five adults experienced unwanted contact sexual violence as a child and a similar number experienced unwanted non-contact sexual violence. The rate for unwanted contact sexual violence as a child was 25% for women compared with 15% for men. Child sexual violence was experienced by women and men across all age groups but young women aged between 18 and 24 reported the highest levels. For example, unwanted sexual intercourse as a child was reported by 10% of women aged between 18 and 24 compared with 2% of men in this age group. Extensive consultation was a notable feature of the development of this survey, which was important to ensure that it was capturing the breadth of experiences in Ireland and that the resultant data met the needs of policy development. This survey could not have been achieved without the excellent work of the CSO, the support of the Department of Justice which provided funding for the survey, the range of stakeholders in the support service community and related agencies who all contributed on an ongoing basis to the development of the project and most importantly, the 4,500 respondents who completed this survey. I want to recognise the almost 500 respondents who acknowledged their own sexual violence experience for the first time. This is a testament to the sensitive and considered approach adopted by the CSO to all aspects of the survey.The data represent a range of individual stories which speak to the lived experience of those who have and those who have not experienced sexual violence in Ireland. The suite of publications resulting from this survey will provide a lot of important detail and insight on a very serious and sensitive societal issue."	spk_194

Debates like this are important because they give us the opportunity to reflect on issues affecting the hospital sector. This debate has given us a very valuable opportunity to discuss what are, without doubt, extremely important matters when it comes to ensuring that our hospitals are safely staffed. I take this opportunity to recognise the remarkable work of the staff in our health service, including those who have been there for many years and those more recently recruited under the initiatives mentioned. I commend these staff on their dedication, professionalism and commitment to delivering health services to patients. We will continue to invest in our workforce, we will continue to grow it and we will continue to provide to the members of our workforce additional opportunities for learning and advancement. Many of the issues discussed today are being prioritised in terms of the reviews, including those relating to safe staffing levels and ongoing recruitment and retention across our healthcare services. As the Minister indicated, the Government's objective is to ensure that patients get the best care possible through providing safe levels of staff in our hospitals. Implementation of the Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix in General and Specialist Medical and Surgical Care Settings in Ireland is a priority in this regard. It is acknowledged that there have been some challenges with implementation of the framework in hospitals. In order to overcome these challenges, a revised governance structure was put in place in November 2022. The Department of Health is represented on the oversight group established under the latter. The Minister spoke about the first two phases of the safe staff nursing and skill mix framework. Phase 1 deals with general and specialist medical and surgical care settings and phase 2 deals with adult emergency care settings. I want to update the House on progress in respect of phase 3, which comprises three distinct care settings. Implementation of the framework has commenced in long-term residential care settings for older persons and will commence later this year in community care settings. Implementation in step-down rehabilitation settings will then follow. Legislation is sometimes cited as a solution to the problem of staffing shortages, but very few countries have implemented this as a solution. Of those that have passed legislation, some are struggling to implement it. Two of the main aims of introducing legislation for nurse staffing levels would be to promote patient safety and improve working conditions for nursing staff. The Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix in General and Specialist Medical and Surgical Care Settings in Ireland incorporates these principles and goes beyond them to include improving quality of care. Internationally, there is limited evidence available which would justify the need to introduce legislation for safe staffing, whether as an effective solution to addressing recruitment and retention of nurses or otherwise. Recent evidence from the UK relating to tools and systems to determine nurse staffing requirements shows that there are no superior patient classification systems. Instead, the use of measurement tools that are endorsed by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, was recommended. The patient acuity system, which has been used in Ireland for many years, is in line with this NICE recommendation. From the evidence we have, safe staffing policies, such as those used in Ireland, result in more registered nurses at the bedside and these policies have a clear and positive impact on patient and nursing staff outcomes. Reforming our health and social care services is critical for the services we are delivering today and for the care needs of the next generation. Our ambition is universal healthcare. What this means for people is that when they need healthcare, they will be able to access it quickly, it will be of consistently high quality and it will be free or affordable. A significant programme of ongoing reform is under way and is making progress. This Government's aim is to make our health service one of the most attractive places around the world for healthcare professionals. I will now speak about some of the improvements that have been delivered in the acute hospital sector and that have made a real difference to patients. This is despite the significant challenges faced in 2022 due to Covid-19 surges, pressure on emergency departments and other operational factors, including problems hiring staff. Some 1.56 million patients were removed from waiting lists, a further 1.53 million patients were added, there was a net reduction of 30,000 men, women and children in the numbers on the lists and the number of patients exceeding the maximum wait times in the 2017 Oireachtas Sláintecare report decreased by 11% and, since pandemic peaks, 24%. The Government continues to invest in order to reduce the amount of time people are waiting for important hospital appointments and procedures. In 2022, some €350 million was allocated to the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund to primarily provide additional public and private activity to further stabilise and reduce scheduled care waiting lists and waiting times in tandem with bringing forward much-needed longer-term reforms. For 2023, this investment has increased to €363 million. Some €123 million funding was allocated to the HSE in budget 2023. This will be made available on a recurring basis to ensure the reforms deliver sustained reductions in waiting lists and ensure we achieve the strategic Sláintecare maximum wait time targets. The Government has invested record sums in our health service. This has been used to boost permanent capacity, which is key to helping us tackle our waiting lists. Our workforce has grown by over 18,000 - doctors, nurses, midwives and therapists - since the beginning of 2020. The Government takes the issues raised in respect of safe staffing levels in hospitals very seriously. I thank Members for their valuable contributions. We will reflect closely on Members' contributions. Many of the issues highlighted are already being addressed by means of our programme for Government commitments, our national policies and strategies and through the HSE's national service plan. We have achieved much in recent years through new developments and improvements to existing services.	spk_468

Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-03-01	dail	33	Future of Regional Pre-Hospital Emergency Care: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the future of regional pre-hospital emergency care on behalf of the Minister for Health. I join colleagues from across the House in paying tribute to our fantastic healthcare staff, working in pre-hospital emergency care and across the wider system. The landscape of pre-hospital emergency care is changing, in Ireland and across the world. We have a growing and ageing population and our health service needs to adapt to accommodate this and provide high-quality care. The NAS has a pivotal role to play in meeting this challenge. In recent years, it has undertaken a significant programme of reform that began in 2016 with the Vision 2020 strategy, which has laid the building blocks for the transformation of the service. This vision aims to transition the NAS from being a conventional emergency medical service to an agile and responsive mobile medical service. More patients than ever are being treated over the phone, at the scene or preferably in their own homes, in line with the vision of the Sláintecare programme. This change is backed by funding. As part of budget 2022, the Government invested a record amount in excess of €200 million in the NAS. This represented an overall increase in annual funding of around €30 million since 2019. A further increase in the budget for NAS in 2023 is envisaged once final allocations are confirmed. The service has also seen staffing levels increasing by almost a fifth since Vision 2020 was published. Along with the unprecedented funding allocations provided by the Government, this has allowed the NAS to make significant progress in delivering a new model of care. For example, we have been able to add additional clinical capacity in the National Emergency Operations Centre, NEOC, in Tallaght. This has enabled the NAS to introduce alternative care pathways, such as see and treat and hear and treat. This allows the NAS to assess and treat many patients with the most appropriate level of care, resulting in better patient experiences and a more efficient use of resources. We are continuing to invest in the NEOC clinical hub, which means a growing number of callers clinically triaged to the hub do not require unnecessary conveyance by ambulance to a hospital accident and emergency department where there is no clinical need. In fact, since October 2020, the NAS has treated nearly 50,000 patients through this alternative care pathway. Of those patients treated, more than 43%, or nearly 19,000 people, did not need to be taken to a hospital accident and emergency department. This is a great example of Sláintecare in action and we will continue to develop and grow this crucial service to meet the growing demands of our population. The Government is committed to supporting the NAS in its development and transformation of patient care. In addition to funding for budgets 2021 and 2022, the NAS has been allocated €6.8 million in targeted funding under the HSE winter plan. This funding is assisting the NAS in responding to an ever-increasing demand for access to emergency services. It is also assisting the NAS in further developing and expanding coverage of its see and treat initiative, including the pathfinder model of care, which involves the service collaborating with healthcare professionals to see and treat older persons in the comfort of their own homes, where clinically appropriate. As with other areas of the health service, our ambulance services are also seeing a sustained demand for emergency resources. This is impacting the NAS’s ability to meet response targets. Included among the reasons for this are significant general increases in the demand for ambulance services. Last year saw a record number of nearly 390,000 emergency calls for an ambulance, exceeding the previous record number of more than 366,000 such calls in 2021, a rise of between 6% and 7%. There has been an even more significant rise in the number of activated emergency calls involving the dispatch of an emergency resource, up from 157,285 in 2021 to 178,224 in 2022, which is a increase of nearly 21,000 or more than 13% in a single year. Equally, there is ongoing pressure on hospital accident and emergency departments, which significantly impacts ambulance turnaround times, particularly on the time required to release an ambulance from a hospital accident and emergency department following patient transport, as well as the ongoing need for Covid-19-related enhanced infection prevention and control, ICP, measures. Regarding ambulance turnaround times, the HSE’s stated target is that 80% of ambulances will be released and available for retasking within 30 minutes of arrival at an accident and emergency department with a patient. I acknowledge this target is not always met. Through dedicated funding provided by the Government under this year’s winter plan, however, the NAS has been able to improve ambulance turnaround times at busy accident and emergency departments. The NAS was also allocated funding for private ambulance companies to deliver a total of 27,000 hours of inter-hospital transfer and discharge services. This crucial investment has helped to preserve emergency ambulance resources for front-line demands. The Government remains committed to investing and growing the NAS to meet the demand for pre-hospital emergency care services as well as developing and expanding its suite of alternative care pathways so that growing numbers of patients receive primary, person-centred care in line with the aims of Sláintecare. To develop and grow the NAS, we need to ensure an adequate supply of qualified paramedics is coming through. That is why substantial funding has been allocated to increase the number of student paramedics training at the NAS college. The NAS recruitment programme in 2022 was highly successful, with an intake of 175 students into its BSc in paramedic studies programme. Our fantastic healthcare workers are the heartbeat of the healthcare system, and we need to support them to deliver the best possible care for patients day in and day out. That is why the NAS has developed a HR people plan for 2022-25 to enhance employee experience, optimise working environments and meet expectations of health policy in Ireland. The NAS in 2020 launched its holistic model of staff support, called Wellness NAS, which details the range of supports available to support the well-being of staff. In 2022 the NAS was also allocated funding to strengthen management and governance arrangements, and it plans to further strengthen management, technical and business functions as part of the new service development plans for 2023. Looking forward, a draft new National Ambulance Service strategic plan to 2031 is with the Department for review. This strategy builds on the vision and objectives of the previous strategy and will further develop innovative alternative care pathways for patients. Planning for the new strategy has been informed by demand and capacity analysis to project patient demand into the future. Of course, additional funding will be required to meet the expected rise in service demand. Since Vision 2020 was launched in 2016, the population has grown by 8% to an estimated 5.12 million. The population of those over 65 years of age has grown by 20% to 768,900 in 2022. These demographic changes informed the work carried out in preparation for the new strategy in terms of the required capacity and in further developing alternative care pathways. In this context it is clear the National Ambulance Service has a central role in the transition of the healthcare system to a community care model. A key strand of the NAS's strategic reform will be to play an ever-increasing role in delivering patient care in the community and in treating our older population where most clinically appropriate. One fantastic example of this is the pathfinder model. This innovative service was first trialled in Beaumont and has been rolled out to Tallaght, Limerick and Waterford. The service aims to avoid bringing people over 65 years of age to hospital emergency departments, where clinically appropriate. This approach increases the availability of ambulance resources for front-line emergency response. Sites are being identified for further service expansion this year. Another recent initiative developed by the NAS, in collaboration with a number of hospital groups, has been the medical assessment unit pathway pilot project. This project was trialled in north Cork and Mallow General Hospital in 2022 and has been rolled out to additional medical assessment units, MAUs, in Ennis, Roscommon and Nenagh. This approach aims to reduce patient presentations at emergency departments and will release ambulances more quickly to respond to other emergency calls. It also allows patients to access an appropriate level of care closer to the home. I expect this service to be expanded later this year to other locations. It is important we harness the learnings from this and other initiatives as we explore new and innovative ways of working. It is clear that the pandemic fundamentally changed the way in which healthcare services are safely accessed and delivered. The role of pre-hospital emergency care practitioners has changed and will continue to do so as they increasingly become providers of primary as well as emergency care services. The Department of Health is examining the regulatory framework governing the delivery of pre-hospital care in Ireland to ensure that it meets the growing and changing needs of the sector. I reiterate that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Government are committed to supporting the NAS through this transformative period.	spk_22

Directly or indirectly, illicit drugs use affects all of us. No matter what our gender, age or socioeconomic background, whether we live in rural or urban areas, no one is immune from the risks or harm caused by illicit drugs use. Some of the harmful effects of drug use are hidden and opaque. More often, they stare us in the face. We see the devastating toll addiction takes on people's lives. We see the needless and often preventable loss of life through overdose and disease transmission. We see the impact of drug-related violence and intimidation in communities throughout the country. Too many families have lost loved ones through addiction. I believe there is a strong consensus in this House and among the public that the State and society generally need to respond far more effectively to the problems caused by illicit drugs use. We need more lives saved, more people in treatment and rehabilitation, and more people in recovery. We need to reduce harm, reduce supply, reduce demand, and increase resilience, health and well-being in society. The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to progressing the establishment of four citizens' assemblies on biodiversity loss, the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin, the future of education and drugs use. The first two of these, the Dublin Citizens' Assembly and the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss, have now concluded their work. The Dublin Citizens' Assembly submitted its final report and recommendations to the Oireachtas in December 2022. The Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss held its final meeting on 21 January, and its report and recommendations will be submitted to the Oireachtas in the coming weeks. At its meeting last week, the Government agreed to the establishment of a citizens' assembly on drugs use. As Minister of State with responsibility for public health, well-being and the national drugs strategy I am pleased to bring forward in this House the motion approving the establishment of the citizens' assembly on drugs use. The terms of reference for the assembly have been designed so that they are sufficiently well defined to provide a clear focus for the assembly. At the same time, they are not so prescriptive as to inhibit the scope of the assembly to define its work programme as it deems appropriate. We have learnt from the experience of previous assemblies that the terms of reference should not be expressed in an overly precise way. Every citizens' assembly needs discretion and flexibility to define and organise its work programme as it deems appropriate. I believe the proposed terms of reference for the citizens' assembly on drugs use, as set out in the motion before this House, provide sufficient scope for the assembly to determine its work programme, consider all issues it deems relevant to drugs use in Ireland, and deliver carefully considered recommendations to the Oireachtas. The terms of reference state that the assembly shall consider and make recommendations in respect of changes the State might make to reduce significantly the harmful impact of drugs use on individuals, families, communities and wider society. In its considerations the assembly will be asked to take into account the implications for the health, justice and education systems. An important part of the assembly's work will be in developing an understanding of the lived experience of individuals, families and communities impacted by illicit drugs use. The voices of those most affected by illicit drugs use must be heard if the assembly is to deliver on its mandate. Alongside this, the members will be asked to consider a range of perspectives on drugs use both from a national viewpoint but also from experiences across Europe and internationally. It will also consider the efficacy of current responses to drugs use and best practice in promoting and supporting rehabilitation and recovery from drug addiction. Ireland is widely regarded as a world leader in deliberative democracy. Citizens' assemblies have become an important part of the Irish democratic process, and the recommendations of previous citizens' assemblies have influenced significant changes in how we in this State live our lives, including through constitutional change, legislative change and changes in the design and implementation of policy. It is clear to me that a citizens' assembly on drugs use can make an invaluable contribution to inform the Oireachtas and Government in our response to the challenging issue of drugs use. The citizens' assembly can also make a valuable contribution to a wider societal debate on drugs policy. There are differing viewpoints in this House, among front-line service providers and among the public about the most appropriate way to respond to the challenges posed by illicit drugs use. The Government has set out its approach in the national drugs strategy, which emphasises the importance of a health-led approach. In recent years, several Oireachtas committees have considered issues around drugs use, and I expect Oireachtas Members will follow with interest the progress of the citizens' assembly. The assembly will engage comprehensively with professional bodies, stakeholders, representative groups and the public as well as national and international experts. It is important the assembly is afforded the time and space to undertake its deliberations carefully and comprehensively. The citizens' assembly should, and must, operate entirely independently of Government and the Oireachtas. There is, of course, a reporting relationship between the citizens' assembly and the Oireachtas. The motion before the House today proposes that the assembly should report in the first instance to the Houses of the Oireachtas, which, on receipt of the final report of the assembly, will refer the report to the relevant Oireachtas committee for consideration. In addition, it is proposed that the Government will provide, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, a response to the recommendations of the assembly and an indication of a proposed course of action, where appropriate. The Dáil will debate the report of the assembly and the Government's response. The citizens' assembly on drugs use will include an independent chairperson and 99 members of the public selected using a random selection process. Building on the successful experience last year, eligibility for membership will extend beyond those enrolled on the electoral register to include all residents in the State.This opens the citizens' assembly up to non-Irish residents and others who, for whatever reason, are not enrolled on the electoral register. Recruitment will be done by a postal campaign, with 20,000 randomly selected households invited to apply to participate in the assembly. Members will be selected on the basis of gender, age and geographic location to ensure the citizens' assembly is as representative as possible of wider Irish society. We have learned much from the experience of previous assemblies, and following the use of this process last year, I am confident this approach will continue to optimise the profile of the citizens' assembly. The timeline for the citizens' assembly is ambitious but achievable. Its inaugural meeting will take place in April, with the assembly scheduled to conclude its work and submit its report by the end of this year. Successive citizens' assemblies have demonstrated how this unique exercise in deliberative democracy enhances Ireland's democratic system. Involving members of the public in considering and proposing solutions to complex societal challenges makes an important contribution to the deliberative processes of the Government and the Oireachtas. It also enhances the public sphere, informing wider conversations and societal debates about matters of public importance. The House will join me in wishing the citizens' assembly well in undertaking the important work it is being asked to do. Molaim an tairscint seo don Teach. I commend the motion to the House."	spk_155
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-02-21	dail	33	Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use: Motion	dbsect_13	I thank the Deputies for their thoughtful and constructive statements in support of the motion before the House. It is clear from the statements over the past hour or so that there is widespread support in Dáil Éireann for a citizens' assembly on drugs use. There is also a clear sense of the urgency of the task. As I said in my opening remarks, this country has seen too much pain and suffering caused by drugs use. Too many families have lost loved ones through overdose. Too many lives have been ruined by addiction. Too many communities have been living in fear of the criminal gangs who supply drugs in towns and villages throughout the country. As this debate has once again demonstrated, the challenges arising from drug use are complex and multifaceted. While we know there are no easy answers, there is a clear sense in this House and beyond that the time has come for bold action and new solutions. This is why the decision to establish a citizens' assembly to look at the issues is so timely. Citizens' assemblies serve to enhance the quality of Ireland's democratic system. Previous assemblies have shown that members of the public have an important contribution to make in addressing complex societal challenges. I expect the citizens' assembly on drugs use will be no different in this regard. In their statements, Deputies have identified a range of priorities they think the citizens' assembly on drugs use should address. A number of amendments have been tabled that seek to nuance the terms of reference or explicitly itemise various things Deputies believe the citizens' assembly should look at. I fully appreciate the intent behind these proposed amendments. Every Deputy who has spoken has a keen interest in ensuring the citizens' assembly does not overlook or neglect important issues. All parties are looking for the same outcome, which is a comprehensive, careful and considered process in which the citizens' assembly looks at all issues mentioned by the Deputies today. Experience shows us that we should not be overly prescriptive or too detailed in the terms of reference. We must trust the process and the members of the citizens' assembly. Let us consider that Ireland's citizens' assembly model is regarded internationally as a leading exemplar of deliberative democracy in action. Citizens' assemblies have become a valuable part of Ireland's democratic system. Recommendations from a citizens' assembly can have a considerable influence on changes to policy, legislation and even the Constitution. They also have a significant role in informing wider public debate on important topics. Previous assemblies have made recommendations on topics such as marriage equality, repeal of the eighth amendment, gender equality, climate change and biodiversity. We must continue to learn from experience and build on what has worked successfully in the past. This principle applies, in particular, to the framing of the terms of reference. We know from experience that an overly detailed terms of reference can inadvertently inhibit the autonomy, discretion and flexibility necessary for the citizens' assembly to define and organise its work programme as it deems appropriate. Experience with citizens' assemblies has proven time and again that the Oireachtas can trust and, indeed, must trust both the process and the members of the assembly. The importance of the voice of young people was raised earlier. I reassure Deputies that the voice of young people will be heard at the citizens' assembly. To this end, I have initiated a consultation with young people through Comhairle na nÓg and youth drug projects throughout the country, which will be presented to the citizens' assembly for its consideration. On the selection of members of the citizens' assembly, there is now a new and improved method to randomly select members. People are not handpicked. There is no guarantee that every county will have a person on the citizens' assembly, but there is a guarantee that the final 99 members will correspond with the population profile by region, age group and gender. I am satisfied the terms of reference as set out in the motion give the citizens' assembly the scope and flexibility it needs to consider all relevant matters relating to drugs use. This includes each and every issue Deputies have emphasised today. The citizens' assembly secretariat will be fully apprised of this debate and will be cognisant of the concerns and priorities Deputies have highlighted. Ultimately, it will be up to the members of the citizens' assembly to determine their own work programme. Once we are clear that the terms of reference are sufficiently well defined to allow for the assembly to examine the issues, we will need to step back, respect the independence of the process, and allow the members the space and freedom to get on with the task in hand. In due course, the assembly will report back to the Oireachtas, at which point the appropriate committee will have the opportunity to consider, debate and respond to the report and its recommendations. Meanwhile, I am pleased to confirm that the assembly will be up and running in a few short weeks. Recruitment of members will begin in the coming days, and the first meeting of the assembly will take place in mid-April. All going according to schedule, the assembly is due to report back to the Oireachtas by the end of this year. I wish the citizens' assembly every success in its work and I look forward to seeing the outcome of its deliberations in due course.	spk_183
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-02-16	dail	33	Co-ordination of International Protection Services: Statements	dbsect_32	"The planning, management and allocation of health resources has been particularly challenging over the last year, due to the arrival in Ireland of over 80,000 refugees in 2022, the majority of whom are from Ukraine. Refugees arriving in Ireland have different health needs from the rest of the population. Furthermore, being a refugee is a social determinant of health, which is associated with considerable trauma and vulnerability. We need to recognise that refugees and migrants are a population group that has to be catered for in line with the Sláintecare reform programme and the HSE national intercultural health strategy. The HSE national intercultural health strategy provides a comprehensive and integrated approach to addressing the many unique health and support needs experienced by refugees and other migrant groups. To address the distinct health needs of refugees, the Department of Health works closely with the HSE's national Ukraine health response planning and co-ordination group to plan, co-ordinate and support the delivery of healthcare services for the growing refugee population. Delivery of health services to incoming Ukrainian refugees and international protection applicants has necessitated the rapid mobilisation of dedicated staffing and services which heretofore did not exist. In this context, the HSE has developed an integrated refugee health service delivery model to provide healthcare services for refugees. The model includes a health assessment model for Ukrainian refugees in the national transit centre in Citywest, which identifies individual health needs. The HSE has established area crisis management teams in all community healthcare areas, which complement existing community services. The crisis management teams are co-ordinating with local service responses and they work closely with the community response forums to co-ordinate interagency services at the local level. Community healthcare services include multidisciplinary teams that are providing in-reach services to assess urgent health needs and are referring refugees to the appropriate services. The teams conduct risk assessments on Covid and other health issues, including infectious diseases. GP capacity to deliver services to the arriving refugee population remains a significant issue. There is a finite resource of GPs and capacity challenges already existed prior to the arrival of refugees from Ukraine. The accommodation model that is being used to house refugees adds to the increasingly challenged capacity. The uneven geographic spread of refugees, which is concentrated in communities along the Atlantic coast, is causing a significant strain on GP capacity in many areas. There are more than 1,100 dispersed facilities accommodating Ukrainians and other refugees across the country. Demand for GP services among the refugee population is surpassing the demand from the existing population. The HSE, in conjunction with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, has prepared bespoke options to deliver GP services to refugees accommodated in hotels and other temporary settings. The exact model varies depending on the number and geographical distribution. However, all have access to GP out-of-hours services. Temporary sessional GP clinics are provided on a weekly basis to deliver regular services, increasing the number of sessional clinics across the country to 40 per week. This is a HSE priority for 2023. Another HSE priority is providing vaccinations and immunisations to refugee populations. All refugees have access to Covid-19 vaccinations. They can be requested from their chosen GP or pharmacist and accessed through the HSE vaccination centres. All community healthcare organisations, CHOs, are advising on how to access vaccination services, while on-site clinics have been provided in a number of settings. However, the uptake of vaccinations in migrant populations is low. The risk of spread of airborne diseases is greater for beneficiaries of temporary protection and international protection applicants due to the congregated living arrangements. To mitigate these risks, the HSE established a catch-up immunisation programme for migrant children and young adults. The roll-out of the catch-up programme is under way and will have commenced in all CHOs before the end of February. In addition, targeted public health communications are delivered to refugee populations, advising them of how to keep themselves or their families safe from respiratory illnesses across the winter period and how to access Covid and flu vaccinations. The ""keep well in winter"" message resources are available on the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre website. As I am conscious that I am sharing my time with Deputy Troy, I will let him in."	spk_372

I highlight the progress made in relation to dual diagnosis under the national drugs strategy, which comes under my remit as the Minister of State with responsibility for public health, well-being and the national drugs strategy. The national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, represents a whole-of-government response to the problem of drug and alcohol use in Ireland. As Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I assure Deputies that the Government is committed to its full implementation. Giving people a say in their own treatment and supporting them to play a role in their own recovery as part of a health-led, person-centred approach is at the heart of the strategy. Improving outcomes for people with co-occurring mental illness and substance misuse problems is a key strategic action under the national drugs strategy. In this context, I welcome the work under way in the HSE on dual diagnosis. It is important that people with a dual diagnosis receive an assessment, onward referral and timely access to appropriate treatment. People presenting with both addiction and mental health problems are often among the most vulnerable in our society. We must ensure that the treatment given to these individuals is based on a strong evidence base and drawn from best practice. I am aware the recent Health Research Board evidence review on dual diagnosis treatment services demonstrates that there is good evidence that greater integration of mental health and addiction services leads to improved treatment outcomes among this group, and this is very welcome. Enhancing access to and delivery of drug and alcohol services in the community was identified as one of the six strategic priorities in the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, which was completed in 2022. I understand that the strategic implementation group as well, which includes representation from drug and alcohol task forces, the HSE, Tusla and the community and voluntary sector has identified dual diagnosis as a priority area of focus for enhancing services in community settings. I look forward to seeing this new initiative implemented and to hearing about the progress that will be made. I am confident that this initiative will help in improving people's lives and help them on the road to recovery.As mentioned earlier by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, this week the Government agreed to establish a citizens' assembly on drug use. This assembly will look at all aspects of drug use in Ireland today, including what changes might be made at a policy, legislative and operational level to reduce the harmful effects of illicit drug use. The work of the assembly will be very important to ongoing discussions on dual diagnosis, including the Bill before us. Allowing the work of the assembly to take place will better inform the debate on this Bill in 12 months' time. As we all know, mental illness and addiction frequently occur together but have traditionally been treated separately, often in isolation. I echo the comments of my colleague Deputy Butler about the progress of the HSE's clinical programme for dual diagnosis and welcome the implementation of the HSE's model of care following approval from the College of Psychiatrists. I welcome the progress with the selection of the dual diagnosis sites across the country and the commencement of recruitment of posts for these sites, beginning with CHOs 3, 4 and 9, as mentioned by Deputy Butler. I look forward to the further roll-out of the model of care across the remaining CHOs. As the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, stated, further resourcing will be needed to continue the roll-out of the teams and the model of care and we will continue to seek any additional funding required in future Estimates processes. I confirm that we as a Government are not opposed to the Bill before us. However, the timed amendment will afford the Department of Health the space to progress the matter in collaboration with Deputies to ensure the challenges faced by those with a dual diagnosis in accessing services appropriate to their needs can be met and tackled. I thank everyone for the valuable contributions they have made this evening. I thank Deputies Ward and Gould for raising the matter and I look forward to further progress being made on it in due course.	spk_427

Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-02-01	dail	33	Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence	dbsect_3	On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, I thank the Deputy for raising this important topic. It is a terrible reality that sexual assault and violence continue within our society. The 2022 annual report for sexual assault treatment units, SATUs, in Ireland is yet to be finalised but the provisional data for 2022 show that approximately 1,050 people attended across the six units in Ireland in that year. This represents an increase of 191, or 22%, on the 2021 attendance figure of 859. I note that the 2018 and 2019 attendance figures were almost identical at 941 and 943, respectively. The 2022 figure shows an increase of almost 110, or 12%, on both 2018 and 2019. This 12% increase over the four-year period since 2018 gives perhaps the most balanced view of trends over recent years and should be viewed through the lens of work we are doing across government to encourage more victims to come forward to seek supports and report these heinous crimes. Sexual violence is defined as any sexual act performed on the victim without consent. SATUs support people who have experienced rape or sexual assault and provide responsive and person-focused care for people aged 14 years and older who have experienced sexual violence. There are six SATUs throughout Ireland located in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Mullingar, Letterkenny and Waterford. Each unit aims to provide care 24 hours a day, seven days a week and respond within three hours to ensure that people can access care in a timely fashion, as set out in the 2023 publication, Sexual Assault Treatment Unit National Guidelines on Referral and Forensic Clinical Examination Following Rape and Sexual Assault. The SATUs are geographically distributed to enable any patient nationally to access the service within a three-hour window, optimising both the health and criminal justice responses to sexual crimes. The Government has always been very clear that regardless of the circumstances in which sexual violence has occurred, a victim of these crimes can and should report their experience to An Garda Síochána. Victims of these crimes also have the option of calling the excellent front-line services provided by organisations such as the Rape Crisis Centre, which offer non-judgmental support, a listening ear and information. Their services are for both women and men and the work they do in this difficult space needs to be commended. The services provided by SATUs have two main components: the provision of health and supportive care, and the collection of forensic evidence. SATUs are the key health sector supports available to victims of rape and sexual assault. Responsibility for responding to sexual violence is shared across government. The Government's commitment to tackling the issue of sexual violence is further demonstrated by the publication of the O'Malley review implementation plan, Supporting A Victim’s Journey: A Plan to Help Victims and Vulnerable Witnesses in Sexual Violence Cases, and the work being progressed through the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which was launched last year. Through the Supporting a Victim's Journey plan, a number of recommendations to support victims of sexual crime have been progressed, including recommendations on the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, the introduction of trained intermediaries, training for front-line professionals and actions to reduce delays in the trial process.	spk_17
Hildegarde Naughton	52	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2023-02-01	dail	33	Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy again for raising this important topic. In my concluding remarks, I wish to refer to the SATU policy review, which began in September 2018 and concluded in February 2019 and examined the efficacy of these treatment units. The review team comprised staff from the Department of Health, the then Department of Justice and Equality, the HSE and the SATUs. I am pleased to say the implementation of the policy review recommendations has been completed. The fifth edition of the National Guidelines on Referral and Forensic Clinical Examination Following Rape and Sexual Assault, have been developed this year as an inter-agency document to ensure clearly defined referral pathways exist in order that all people, regardless of age or gender, can access appropriate individualised care that is responsive to their needs. The implementation of the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence strategy for the period 2022 to 2026, as well as the completion of a range of other projects across many Government Departments, will be essential in achieving the aim of reducing sexual crime. Responsibility for responding to sexual violence is shared across the Government. I am aware that the Department of Justice has agreed with the CSO to the development and delivery of a significant new national survey on the prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland. It will look in detail at the experience of sexual violence and abuse for both women and men in Ireland. Having the most relevant and up-to-date data on the prevalence of sexual violence will continue to help us to plan for better services and supports for victims, including across SATUs.	spk_19

It also removes references to balance sheets, profit and loss accounts and cash flow statements to reflect changes in financial terminology. The sections 30(3) and 30(4) proposed in the amendment provide that, in limited circumstances, a subsidiary of the IAA could be audited by a commercial statutory audit firm rather than by the Comptroller and Auditor General. This is subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, following consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General. Amendment No. 18 relates to the final accounts and final annual report of the Commission for Aviation Regulation.

As originally drafted and initiated in this House, the Bill increased the reporting time from three years to five years. This increase was informed by the fact that, when the 1993 Act was enacted, the IAA was not subject to significant oversight and audit by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA. That agency was established in 2002, some five years after the establishment of the IAA. While the reports required under section 32 remain an important oversight tool, much of the section's intent is now addressed by EASA oversight. It was on this basis that the interval of five years was seen as more appropriate given the changed regulatory and oversight landscape at European level. However, following engagement with Senators, I introduced an amendment to section 66 of the Bill to move the five-year period back to a three-year period. The second amendment, amendment No. 13, removes the Minister's discretion to withhold publication of the report and requires him or her to cause a copy of the report to be published on a website of the Government.	spk_572

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-29	dail	33	Toll Charge Increases: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_16	I thank Deputies for the opportunity to speak to the House about the increase in toll prices on a number of national roads. I can confirm that the Government is not opposing the motion. However, while the overall objective of the motion is in line with the Government's concern around the increase in the cost of living and its effect on workers, families and businesses, there were some assertions made in the motion which require clarification and will be highlighted in the ministerial speeches this evening. There are 11 toll roads in the State, of which ten are on the national road network. The East Link-Ringsend bridge toll in Dublin is on the local road network. Of the ten tolls on the national road network, two are essentially public tolls, namely the M50 and the Dublin tunnel. Revenue from these tolls is collected directly for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, by operating companies under contract to Tll. These revenues are invested by Tll in the operation and maintenance of the road network. It is important to point out that toll income is not allocated to the construction of new roads, but rather to the protection and renewal of the existing network. It should also be noted that there are extra inflationary costs in the construction industry, particularly in regard to products such as bitumen which is used in road pavement repair, meaning the cost of the protection and renewal of the existing network has increased significantly. The other eight roads are public private partnership roads which were constructed and are now operated and maintained under long-term contracts with Tll. Revenue generated by these roads is collected by the PPP company and used to repay loans arising from the construction of the road and to fund ongoing operations and maintenance activities. The public, private and contract law considerations with respect to increasing toll charges for public toll roads and PPP toll roads are somewhat different. In addition, there are different financial and budgetary implications relating to toll revenue generated, with TII more reliant on the public toll revenues. In terms of the framework for setting tolls, toll by-laws for each individual road set out the basis for calculating maximum tolls each year. Maximum tolls are calculated for each vehicle category. Tll calculates the maximum tolls for the Dublin tunnel and the M50 and decides the actual tolls that should apply. The PPP companies calculate the maximum tolls for the eight PPP concession schemes and propose the actual tolls that should apply. The mechanism for these calculations is set out in the individual toll by-law and is based on the consumer price index, CPI. Actual tolls charged may not exceed the calculated maximum toll for each scheme. In December 2021, Tll announced an increase in toll charges for eight toll roads for 2022. It should be noted this was the first increase in tolls for motor cars since 2013. This increase was driven by inflation. For 2023, the board of Tll has approved a number of toll changes. In the case of public tolls, there is no change to existing toll rates for the Dublin tunnel, while the toll rates for the M50 have increased across the board. Increases have also been agreed for all eight PPP schemes. These increases include a 30 cent increase for cars without tags or video accounts on the M50, bringing the toll paid to €3.50. On the M4, there will be an increase of 20 cent for cars which brings the toll to €3.20. Tolls on the other PPP schemes will increase by 10 cent. This has been driven by inflation of 8.6%, based on the CPI, and is within the relevant by-laws for each scheme.  It is estimated that these changes will generate approximately €25 million in additional toll revenue, dependent on traffic volume, which will be used for loan repayments in the case of the PPP schemes and maintenance and operations in the schemes in question, and to ensure that toll income continues to support adequately the protection and renewal of the existing road network. Any measures introduced in regard to these toll increases will need to account for the contractual arrangements with the PPP companies, along with the impact on the protection and renewal of the existing road network. PPPs have been instrumental in the expansion of Ireland's motorway network through recent decades, particularly on inter-urban routes. This has delivered safer roads with reduced journey times to the benefit of private motorists, businesses and the haulage sector. Furthermore, the contractual arrangements for these roads ensure they will be maintained in a safe and robust condition before reverting to the State on the ending of the contract. These arrangements have allowed for risk-sharing, efficient project management and delivery and the completion of critical public infrastructure without incurring upfront Exchequer costs. The motion put forward refers to payments to PPP operators. I would like to expand on this. These variable operation payments, VOPs, cover two PPP toll concession contracts, namely the M3 Clonee to Kells and N18 Limerick tunnel. They provide that where traffic volumes do not reach a threshold specified in the respective contract, moneys are paid from the State to the toll operator. This has incentivised private sector infrastructure development on roads where traffic volumes are less certain. Due to Covid-19 restrictions there was a significant drop off in traffic levels across the national road network in 2020-21, including the two VOP contract roads I mentioned. As a result, VOP payments in 2020 and 2021 increased on 2019. In addition to the reduction in traffic due to Covid-19, the other factors that impacted the calculation of VOPs in 2020 and 2021 included the level of traffic guarantee applicable to each year, the level of toll charges applicable to each year and the level of non-availability payments, which are deductions for lane closures, applicable to each year. Covid-19 and the reduced traffic since 2019, combined with the reduced VAT on toll charges in 2020 and 2021, contributed significantly to the increase in 2020 and 2021 payments. It should also be pointed out that as part of a revenue sharing mechanism contained in PPP contracts that if traffic volumes exceed a certain threshold specified in the contract for each scheme, the excess toll revenue returns from the toll operator to the State. In recent years, such revenue has been generated on the M4 and M1. The Department has introduced a number of public transport measures to help to ease the cost of transport, mainly aimed at reducing fares for users.Furthermore, the Department has rolled out an emergency support scheme for hauliers. There have also been other Government measures, such as the reduction on excise duty for petrol and diesel. This is in addition to the various measures outlined in budget 2023 to help people with the challenges relating to the cost of living. The broad intent of this motion is generally in line with the principles of the Government in helping people as the cost of living increases. I can confirm that the Department of Transport has been directed to develop options that might allow for the suspension of planned toll increases until the end of June 2023. As I have outlined, however, the toll contracts are complicated and further discussions with all relevant parties, including TII, are needed.	spk_400
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-29	dail	33	National Car Test	dbsect_33	"I thank the Deputy for his question on the need to make land available to sporting clubs and organisations for the development of sporting and community facilities in villages, towns and cities. I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage continues to support the enhancement of amenities in cities, towns and villages and there have been important policy developments in recent years, as well as considerable funding secured for such enhancements. There are also important planning principles that inform the provision of such spaces. Section 67 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, provides that ""a local authority may take such measures, engage in such activities or do such things (including the incurring of expenditure) as it considers necessary or desirable to promote the interests of the local community"", including in relation to sports, games and other such activities. Schedule 13 of that Act identifies that such measures taken, activities engaged in or things done by local authorities shall include ""the provision (both indoor and outdoor) of playing fields, athletic tracks, swimming pools and other bathing places, sports centres, gymnasia and other facilities and the holding of sporting events"". The reservation of lands for recreational and amenity purposes is a matter to be addressed as part of the review of a city or county development plan. The Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, requires that a development plan include objectives for the zoning of land for use solely or primarily for particular purposes, including for recreational and open space purposes, to such an extent as the proper planning and sustainable development of the area requires. The requirement to make land available for public use is also addressed within guidelines, as follows. The development plan guidelines for planning authorities highlight the role of the city or county development plan in the provision of public open space. It is recommended that the development plan incorporate a public open space strategy that addresses open space provision as part of a wider assessment of community facilities and amenities. It is envisaged that the development would take a strategic view, including identifying any need for local, town or regional parks, with local area plans and other strategies providing greater detail. The guidelines recommend that when making zoning decisions, consideration must be given to the open space required to serve the community, and that lands should be zoned accordingly. The guidelines also note that the development plan can support a structured approach to open space provision within new developments by including requirements and standards to be applied through the planning process, noting the distinction between open space that is required to serve an individual development and that required to serve the community more broadly. The local area plan guidelines of 2013 state that there should be an emphasis on providing conveniently located neighbourhood facilities commensurate with the projected population for a local area, including play areas. Public open spaces should be easily reached and take biodiversity issues into account in their design. The sustainable residential development in urban areas guidelines of 2009 state, in section 4.16, that the provision of public open spaces at district and local level will be guided by city or county wide policies. In new development areas, local area plans should identify the preferred location of larger open spaces, including locations in adjoining non-development areas that may accommodate playing pitches and larger recreational facilities. A more flexible approach is envisaged in housing schemes, with spaces suitable for smaller children's play, informal kick-about and passive amenity. Further detail in this regard is provided within the urban design manual, which supplements the guidelines. Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments 2020, in section 4.13, states that the recreational needs of children must be considered as part of communal amenity space within the apartment scheme. The apartment guidelines also provide further details with regard to the forms and location of such facilities. The guidelines I have cited are issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Planning authorities must have regard to the guidelines when carrying out their strategic planning or development management functions. This means that planning authorities are required to demonstrate how the policies and objectives of the guidelines have been applied. It should be noted that the Department is working towards developing detailed guidelines in relation to sustainable settlements, which will incorporate elements of the 2009 guidelines. It is intended that the proposed sustainable and compact settlement guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Act and will seek to address key issues in relation to the design of open space, which provides a range of active and passive spaces to support the development of amenable neighbourhoods that promote high quality of life for residents."	spk_529
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-29	dail	33	National Car Test	dbsect_33	I will raise those specific comments with the Minister. It is clear to me and to Government that having amenities and supporting community and social infrastructure are critical to planning for sustainable communities. The provision of sufficient sporting, play and cultural spaces in our towns and cities for the residents of a neighbourhood provides significant social dividend in terms of community engagement and public health. This is recognised in Government policy, such as Town Centre First, and the national planning framework and in the publication in June of Development Plans - Guidelines for Planning Authorities. It is the Minister's intention that the sustainable and compact settlement guidelines currently being developed will support the provision of these amenities by setting out core principles of design and place-making to be applied to create places of high quality at the level of district or neighbourhood, housing schemes and individual well-being.	spk_531
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-29	dail	33	National Car Test	dbsect_33	As the Deputy has stated, SIPTU members have served notice of strike action at Zenith Energy Bantry Bay Terminal Limited, located on Whiddy Island in County Cork. The strike action is due to commence on Tuesday, 13 December, in a dispute over redundancies at Zenith Energy. While the Deputy's question refers to the strike at the Zenith storage facility in Bantry, he also makes reference to NORA and the need to ensure the terms and conditions of employment of all employees at the agency are protected and the need to ensure the employer engages with the architecture of industrial relations. In this regard, it is important to clearly state that while NORA holds stocks of petroleum products on the site, NORA employees are not employed on the site nor are they in any way involved in the aforementioned industrial dispute. The employees of Zenith Energy are not NORA employees, NORA merely holds stocks on the site as part of its obligations under legislation. Under the National Oil Reserves Act 2007, NORA was established as a non-commercial State body with responsibility for the management of Ireland's strategic oil reserve. NORA is Ireland's stockholding agency and currently holds approximately 85 days of oil stocks, with approximately 85% of these stocks stored on the island of Ireland. NORA stocks are balanced to match the end-use domestic consumption of the various oil products, petrol, diesel, and kerosene. NORA, having released stock to meet Ireland's obligations under the recent International Energy Agency, IEA, collective actions, is scheduled to increase its stockholding to 90 days in early 2023 as required by Ireland's membership of the European Union and the IEA. NORA holds 85 to 90 days of oil reserves to cover any emergency for resupply through the commercial system. Ireland's policy of holding a strategic oil reserve equivalent to 90 days of net imports is required by both its membership of the EU and the IEA, and is provided for by the National Oil Reserves Agency Act. NORA has operational responsibility for the day-to-day management of the State's strategic oil reserve. This includes the purchase of refined products and entering into agreements with third parties to lease storage capacity, as required. In line with Government policy, the 90-day obligation is met almost entirely by the holding of refined product in Ireland, ready to be placed on the domestic market in the event of a shortage of petroleum products arising in the commercial supply chains or released to the international markets as part of an IEA collective action. The industry has worked hard to boost stock levels since the onset of the war in Ukraine and industry is confident of maintaining supply levels with inventory levels strengthened.	spk_533
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-29	dail	33	National Car Test	dbsect_33	Of course the Government expresses its sympathies. We want to ensure that a resolution is found and that employers engage with the industrial relations architecture. That is clear. As I indicated in my initial response, the industrial dispute which was reported in the media today is a dispute over redundancies at Zenith Energy. NORA is not in any way involved in the aforementioned dispute. While NORA holds stocks of petroleum on the site, NORA employees are not employed on the site. The employees of Zenith Energy are not NORA employees. In relation to Ireland’s security of supply, Ireland is reasonably well insulated from direct supply shocks because few imports of crude oil and a comparatively small proportion of Ireland’s refined product imports come from Russia. Given that the supply of some products on the international oil markets is currently tight, particularly in the case of diesel, the oil supply position on the Irish markets is kept under review by the oil security subgroup, consisting of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Transport, NORA and the importing oil companies. The group meets frequently to assess the security of oil supplies into Irish terminals which are purchased on a commercial basis one month in advance. As things stand, the supply outlook in January looks positive. Given the just-in-time nature of oil supply, issues can manifest at short notice, perhaps within four or five days. As a contingency, NORA holds approximately 85 days of reserve stock and can place stock onto the domestic market to meet shortfalls. Currently, no substantial difficulties in maintaining supplies to the domestic market are forecast, including subsequent to the full implementation of the EU sanctions on Russian crude and refined product on 5 December 2022 and 5 January 2023, respectively.	spk_536
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-29	dail	33	National Car Test	dbsect_33	The operation of roadworthiness testing, including the National Car Test Service, NCTS, is the statutory responsibility of the RSA. Applus+ Inspection Services Ireland Limited administers the test on behalf of the RSA. All operational issues, including the appointment of personnel are matters for Applus+ and the RSA, and it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister of State, to comment on specific operational matters. The NCTS has been experiencing extraordinary pressure, due in part to a national and EU-wide labour shortage of qualified mechanics. To mitigate the risks associated with the testing backlog, work is under way to increase test centre capacity and to reduce the average appointment waiting time. A priority waiting list is in place for motorists to avail of cancellations, the contractor is providing 20 vehicle inspectors from its Spanish operation and the RSA has approved a pilot for additional inspection staff in automated elements of the test. These measures are in addition to the 53 new staff employed by the NCTS earlier in the year, and a significant increase in staff overtime, allowing eight tests per tester per day instead of seven. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy English, with my Department's assistance, has allowed for the recruitment of up to 100 non-EU testers. Some 44 additional testers have commenced training with NCTS and will be conducting testing before the end of the year. In relation to qualifications, I can confirm that the temporary vehicle inspectors from Spain are qualified to QQI level 5, which is the standard in many EU member states and in the UK. Until 2020, QQI level 5 certification was the minimum requirement for vehicle inspectors in the State. Testers in Ireland are currently required to hold QQI level 6 qualifications but the RSA has confirmed that local applicants with QQI level 5 qualifications will be considered for a temporary period and that on-the-job training will be provided to bring testers to QQI level 6 standard. Additionally, I understand that Applus+ sought RSA approval to trial the use of inspection support personnel to assist the existing complement of vehicle inspectors with certain basic and highly automated test elements in stages 1 and 2 of the testing process. Vehicle inspectors will still decide whether a vehicle should pass or fail a test.

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-29	dail	33	Sports Facilities	dbsect_35	"I thank the Deputy for his question on the need to make land available to sporting clubs and organisations for the development of sporting and community facilities in villages, towns and cities. I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage continues to support the enhancement of amenities in cities, towns and villages and there have been important policy developments in recent years, as well as considerable funding secured for such enhancements. There are also important planning principles that inform the provision of such spaces. Section 67 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, provides that ""a local authority may take such measures, engage in such activities or do such things (including the incurring of expenditure) as it considers necessary or desirable to promote the interests of the local community"", including in relation to sports, games and other such activities. Schedule 13 of that Act identifies that such measures taken, activities engaged in or things done by local authorities shall include ""the provision (both indoor and outdoor) of playing fields, athletic tracks, swimming pools and other bathing places, sports centres, gymnasia and other facilities and the holding of sporting events"". The reservation of lands for recreational and amenity purposes is a matter to be addressed as part of the review of a city or county development plan. The Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, requires that a development plan include objectives for the zoning of land for use solely or primarily for particular purposes, including for recreational and open space purposes, to such an extent as the proper planning and sustainable development of the area requires. The requirement to make land available for public use is also addressed within guidelines, as follows. The development plan guidelines for planning authorities highlight the role of the city or county development plan in the provision of public open space. It is recommended that the development plan incorporate a public open space strategy that addresses open space provision as part of a wider assessment of community facilities and amenities. It is envisaged that the development would take a strategic view, including identifying any need for local, town or regional parks, with local area plans and other strategies providing greater detail. The guidelines recommend that when making zoning decisions, consideration must be given to the open space required to serve the community, and that lands should be zoned accordingly. The guidelines also note that the development plan can support a structured approach to open space provision within new developments by including requirements and standards to be applied through the planning process, noting the distinction between open space that is required to serve an individual development and that required to serve the community more broadly. The local area plan guidelines of 2013 state that there should be an emphasis on providing conveniently located neighbourhood facilities commensurate with the projected population for a local area, including play areas. Public open spaces should be easily reached and take biodiversity issues into account in their design. The sustainable residential development in urban areas guidelines of 2009 state, in section 4.16, that the provision of public open spaces at district and local level will be guided by city or county wide policies. In new development areas, local area plans should identify the preferred location of larger open spaces, including locations in adjoining non-development areas that may accommodate playing pitches and larger recreational facilities. A more flexible approach is envisaged in housing schemes, with spaces suitable for smaller children's play, informal kick-about and passive amenity. Further detail in this regard is provided within the urban design manual, which supplements the guidelines. Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments 2020, in section 4.13, states that the recreational needs of children must be considered as part of communal amenity space within the apartment scheme. The apartment guidelines also provide further details with regard to the forms and location of such facilities. The guidelines I have cited are issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Planning authorities must have regard to the guidelines when carrying out their strategic planning or development management functions. This means that planning authorities are required to demonstrate how the policies and objectives of the guidelines have been applied. It should be noted that the Department is working towards developing detailed guidelines in relation to sustainable settlements, which will incorporate elements of the 2009 guidelines. It is intended that the proposed sustainable and compact settlement guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Act and will seek to address key issues in relation to the design of open space, which provides a range of active and passive spaces to support the development of amenable neighbourhoods that promote high quality of life for residents."	spk_529
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-29	dail	33	Sports Facilities	dbsect_35	I will raise those specific comments with the Minister. It is clear to me and to Government that having amenities and supporting community and social infrastructure are critical to planning for sustainable communities. The provision of sufficient sporting, play and cultural spaces in our towns and cities for the residents of a neighbourhood provides significant social dividend in terms of community engagement and public health. This is recognised in Government policy, such as Town Centre First, and the national planning framework and in the publication in June of Development Plans - Guidelines for Planning Authorities. It is the Minister's intention that the sustainable and compact settlement guidelines currently being developed will support the provision of these amenities by setting out core principles of design and place-making to be applied to create places of high quality at the level of district or neighbourhood, housing schemes and individual well-being.	spk_531
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-29	dail	33	Job Losses	dbsect_36	As the Deputy has stated, SIPTU members have served notice of strike action at Zenith Energy Bantry Bay Terminal Limited, located on Whiddy Island in County Cork. The strike action is due to commence on Tuesday, 13 December, in a dispute over redundancies at Zenith Energy. While the Deputy's question refers to the strike at the Zenith storage facility in Bantry, he also makes reference to NORA and the need to ensure the terms and conditions of employment of all employees at the agency are protected and the need to ensure the employer engages with the architecture of industrial relations. In this regard, it is important to clearly state that while NORA holds stocks of petroleum products on the site, NORA employees are not employed on the site nor are they in any way involved in the aforementioned industrial dispute. The employees of Zenith Energy are not NORA employees, NORA merely holds stocks on the site as part of its obligations under legislation. Under the National Oil Reserves Act 2007, NORA was established as a non-commercial State body with responsibility for the management of Ireland's strategic oil reserve. NORA is Ireland's stockholding agency and currently holds approximately 85 days of oil stocks, with approximately 85% of these stocks stored on the island of Ireland. NORA stocks are balanced to match the end-use domestic consumption of the various oil products, petrol, diesel, and kerosene. NORA, having released stock to meet Ireland's obligations under the recent International Energy Agency, IEA, collective actions, is scheduled to increase its stockholding to 90 days in early 2023 as required by Ireland's membership of the European Union and the IEA. NORA holds 85 to 90 days of oil reserves to cover any emergency for resupply through the commercial system. Ireland's policy of holding a strategic oil reserve equivalent to 90 days of net imports is required by both its membership of the EU and the IEA, and is provided for by the National Oil Reserves Agency Act. NORA has operational responsibility for the day-to-day management of the State's strategic oil reserve. This includes the purchase of refined products and entering into agreements with third parties to lease storage capacity, as required. In line with Government policy, the 90-day obligation is met almost entirely by the holding of refined product in Ireland, ready to be placed on the domestic market in the event of a shortage of petroleum products arising in the commercial supply chains or released to the international markets as part of an IEA collective action. The industry has worked hard to boost stock levels since the onset of the war in Ukraine and industry is confident of maintaining supply levels with inventory levels strengthened.	spk_533
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-29	dail	33	Job Losses	dbsect_36	Of course the Government expresses its sympathies. We want to ensure that a resolution is found and that employers engage with the industrial relations architecture. That is clear. As I indicated in my initial response, the industrial dispute which was reported in the media today is a dispute over redundancies at Zenith Energy. NORA is not in any way involved in the aforementioned dispute. While NORA holds stocks of petroleum on the site, NORA employees are not employed on the site. The employees of Zenith Energy are not NORA employees. In relation to Ireland’s security of supply, Ireland is reasonably well insulated from direct supply shocks because few imports of crude oil and a comparatively small proportion of Ireland’s refined product imports come from Russia. Given that the supply of some products on the international oil markets is currently tight, particularly in the case of diesel, the oil supply position on the Irish markets is kept under review by the oil security subgroup, consisting of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Transport, NORA and the importing oil companies. The group meets frequently to assess the security of oil supplies into Irish terminals which are purchased on a commercial basis one month in advance. As things stand, the supply outlook in January looks positive. Given the just-in-time nature of oil supply, issues can manifest at short notice, perhaps within four or five days. As a contingency, NORA holds approximately 85 days of reserve stock and can place stock onto the domestic market to meet shortfalls. Currently, no substantial difficulties in maintaining supplies to the domestic market are forecast, including subsequent to the full implementation of the EU sanctions on Russian crude and refined product on 5 December 2022 and 5 January 2023, respectively.	spk_536
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-29	dail	33	National Car Test	dbsect_37	The operation of roadworthiness testing, including the National Car Test Service, NCTS, is the statutory responsibility of the RSA. Applus+ Inspection Services Ireland Limited administers the test on behalf of the RSA. All operational issues, including the appointment of personnel are matters for Applus+ and the RSA, and it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister of State, to comment on specific operational matters. The NCTS has been experiencing extraordinary pressure, due in part to a national and EU-wide labour shortage of qualified mechanics. To mitigate the risks associated with the testing backlog, work is under way to increase test centre capacity and to reduce the average appointment waiting time. A priority waiting list is in place for motorists to avail of cancellations, the contractor is providing 20 vehicle inspectors from its Spanish operation and the RSA has approved a pilot for additional inspection staff in automated elements of the test. These measures are in addition to the 53 new staff employed by the NCTS earlier in the year, and a significant increase in staff overtime, allowing eight tests per tester per day instead of seven. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy English, with my Department's assistance, has allowed for the recruitment of up to 100 non-EU testers. Some 44 additional testers have commenced training with NCTS and will be conducting testing before the end of the year. In relation to qualifications, I can confirm that the temporary vehicle inspectors from Spain are qualified to QQI level 5, which is the standard in many EU member states and in the UK. Until 2020, QQI level 5 certification was the minimum requirement for vehicle inspectors in the State. Testers in Ireland are currently required to hold QQI level 6 qualifications but the RSA has confirmed that local applicants with QQI level 5 qualifications will be considered for a temporary period and that on-the-job training will be provided to bring testers to QQI level 6 standard. Additionally, I understand that Applus+ sought RSA approval to trial the use of inspection support personnel to assist the existing complement of vehicle inspectors with certain basic and highly automated test elements in stages 1 and 2 of the testing process. Vehicle inspectors will still decide whether a vehicle should pass or fail a test.  I reassure the Deputy that the appointment of these additional resources will not result in the loss of any existing jobs. The new employees will supplement the existing staff to increase testing capacity. The objective is to increase the overall number of testing staff to meet the high demand. The RSA has assured my Department that the high testing standard we expect from the National Car Testing Service, NCTS, will not be compromised in any way as it works to increase testing capacity. 	spk_538

My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy English, with my Department's assistance, is allowing recruitment of up to 100 non-EU testers. Some 44 additional testers are expected before the end of the year for test centres with the most significant delays. The NCT service contract is held by the RSA. As Minister of State, I do not have a role in its administration. Contractual sanctions are a matter for the RSA and penalty clauses apply where the contractor breaches key indicators. The RSA has confirmed that contract mechanisms have applied where service levels have not been met. The contractor is disputing these, however, and further discussions are planned in the coming weeks. With regard to qualifications, I can confirm that the temporary vehicle inspectors from Spain are qualified to Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 5, which is the standard in many EU member states and the UK. Until 2020, the QQI level 5 certification was considered the appropriate minimum requirement for vehicle inspectors in the State. This was changed in accordance with apprenticeship changes in Ireland as well as to align with the commercial standard.	spk_2

To directly answer the Deputy's question regarding motorists, I strongly urge vehicle owners to allow plenty of time to book their tests. The regulations allow a car to be tested up to 90 days before the due date without affecting the expiry date of the certificate issued. Appointment slots are released continuously across all test centres with many also becoming available through cancellations or rescheduling of appointments. Therefore, when motorists are unable to secure an NCT test date before their certificate is due to expire, they should contact the NCT customer service directly and ask to be added to the priority waiting list. The majority of those on the priority list will be provided with an appointment within 30 days.	spk_4

In Ireland, the contribution from the Government to the ORE industry will be embedded in the offshore renewable energy supply schemes, ORESS 1, ORESS 2 and later auctions, where guaranteed income for the electricity produced will enable the wind farms to be financed and cover the cost of required port infrastructure and services. In relation to funding, our State ports operate as independent commercial bodies. Under national ports policy, no Exchequer funding is provided to them.It is envisaged that like all port infrastructure, the ORE facilities will be funded through a combination of: port revenues, including from the ORE industry; EU funding; and borrowing from the likes of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, the European Investment Bank, EIB, and other financial institutions. My Department is already engaging with the various institutions, including the EU Commission, on the availability of funding for ports in providing the ORE infrastructure to meet the EU's and Ireland's ambitions. In line with the policy statement, a number of ports are progressing plans for the delivery of port infrastructure to facilitate ORE deployment activity, including the ports named by the Deputy in this question.

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-10	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy. The primary aim of the Government's Road Safety Strategy 2021-2030 is to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on Irish roads by 50%. As stated at the launch of the strategy in December 2021, this means reducing deaths on Ireland’s roads annually from 144 to 72 or lower and reducing serious injuries from 1,259 to 630 or lower by 2030. This will be the first step in Ireland’s journey towards realising Vision Zero, the international strategy to eliminate all traffic fatalities and serious injuries, while increasing safe, healthy, equitable and sustainable mobility for all by 2050. Implementation of this ambitious strategy is supported by a comprehensive set of 186 high-impact and supporting actions. The strategy will be delivered over three phases with action plans for each. I am happy to reassure the Deputy that my Department, in conjunction with stakeholders and associated Government agencies, is well under way in the delivery of phase 1 for 2021 to 2024. The subsequent phases 2 and 3 of the strategy and their associated actions will be developed in the six months leading up to the launch of each of those phases. This development will, in each case, take account of a review of the action outcomes of the preceding phase of the strategy. As I have no doubt the Deputy will agree, the delivery of an ambitious strategy such as this requires a robust governance structure, and I assure him that this is currently in place to support and enable what is essentially a transformative road safety programme. At the top of this framework sits the ministerial committee on road safety, which I chair jointly with the Minister for Justice. A senior officials' group, comprising senior figures from the key bodies charged with implementing the published road safety actions for each phase of the strategy, known as the road safety transformation partnership board, stands below the ministerial committee. This cross-departmental, multi-agency partnership board provides executive accountability, advice and quarterly updates to the ministerial committee on the delivery of the Government’s strategy.

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-10	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_9	I welcome the contents of the national port study which was commissioned by Wind Energy Ireland. It provides a useful profile of port infrastructure and the proposed development plans of the port companies for both fixed and floating installations. Ireland has ambitious plans with regard to the development of offshore renewable energy in the seas around Ireland. This report aligns with the Government policy I published last December on the facilitation of offshore renewable energy by Irish commercial ports in identifying that a number of port facilities will be required for deployment activity and that multiple ports will be needed for operation and maintenance operations. Delivery of the necessary infrastructure is ongoing in ports to address the requirements of industry. Ireland will potentially need to build on a phased basis four or five standard offshore renewable energy port facilities, each of which should be capable of building 500 MW of offshore renewable energy annually that will act as construction and deployment points over the next 25 to 30 years. In addition, a number of smaller ports will be required for offshore renewable energy operations and maintenance activities. A multi-port approach will ultimately allow investments that are commercially viable in the long-term to progress without undermining the ability of any port to meet its primary obligations in relation to the facilitation of international trade. Officials in the Department have engaged with Wind Energy Ireland in relation to the study and the association along with Marine Renewable Energy Ireland. They made a presentation last month to the offshore renewable energy port's co-ordination group which is chaired by the Department of Transport. In relation to the study recommendations directed at the Department, arrangements are already being made to facilitate a more regular exchange of views and updates between the Department and industry representative associations. With regard to funding, it is envisaged that like all port infrastructure, offshore renewable energy facilities will be funded through a combination of port revenues, EU funding and borrowing from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, the European Investment Bank, EIB, and other financial institutions. My Department is already engaging with the various institutions, including the European Commission, about the availability of funding for ports in providing offshore renewable energy infrastructure to meet EU and Ireland's ambitions. In relation to other recommendations, significant work is ongoing at official level across a number of Departments to accelerate a drive delivery and to capture the longer term potential in this area.	spk_59

I know that all ports across the country, many of which the Minister and I have visited, are working on their own plans to tap into the opportunities in operation and maintenance in the west, for example, in Galway. With regard to Shannon Foynes, the Minister attended the launch of the port's Vision 2041 strategic review. I congratulate Shannon Foynes Port Company and Bechtel on their report, which sets out the opportunity in the Shannon Estuary as a hub for facilitating the development of offshore wind along with the production of clean fuels, including green hydrogen, ammonia and methanol. This is a multi-port approach and our ports are positioning themselves. They are working with the Department and looking at funding opportunities, for example, the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, to which I alluded earlier, which is potentially capable of providing funding for studies and infrastructure across our ports. There is, therefore, substantial work taking place between industry, the Department and the ports examining what is required, particularly in the run-up to the approaching auctions.	spk_61

I am encouraged by the engagement between our ports and industry on working towards potential funding opportunities at EU level, for example, from the EIB and the ISIF. This is a very large endeavour and is ambitious, as it has to be. As the Deputy and I both know from living on the west coast, its offshore renewable energy potential is the new oil reserve that we need to tap into. Everything that can be done is being done. Industry must work with the ports and the Department and we must ensure that our ports are best placed to tap into funding, which will be done through their engagement with industry. It is about having the right infrastructure in the right place to tap into our offshore renewable space.	spk_63
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-11-10	dail	33	Road Safety	dbsect_11	I thank the Deputy. The primary aim of the Government's Road Safety Strategy 2021-2030 is to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on Irish roads by 50%. As stated at the launch of the strategy in December 2021, this means reducing deaths on Ireland’s roads annually from 144 to 72 or lower and reducing serious injuries from 1,259 to 630 or lower by 2030. This will be the first step in Ireland’s journey towards realising Vision Zero, the international strategy to eliminate all traffic fatalities and serious injuries, while increasing safe, healthy, equitable and sustainable mobility for all by 2050. Implementation of this ambitious strategy is supported by a comprehensive set of 186 high-impact and supporting actions. The strategy will be delivered over three phases with action plans for each. I am happy to reassure the Deputy that my Department, in conjunction with stakeholders and associated Government agencies, is well under way in the delivery of phase 1 for 2021 to 2024. The subsequent phases 2 and 3 of the strategy and their associated actions will be developed in the six months leading up to the launch of each of those phases. This development will, in each case, take account of a review of the action outcomes of the preceding phase of the strategy. As I have no doubt the Deputy will agree, the delivery of an ambitious strategy such as this requires a robust governance structure, and I assure him that this is currently in place to support and enable what is essentially a transformative road safety programme. At the top of this framework sits the ministerial committee on road safety, which I chair jointly with the Minister for Justice. A senior officials' group, comprising senior figures from the key bodies charged with implementing the published road safety actions for each phase of the strategy, known as the road safety transformation partnership board, stands below the ministerial committee. This cross-departmental, multi-agency partnership board provides executive accountability, advice and quarterly updates to the ministerial committee on the delivery of the Government’s strategy. Both the ministerial committee and the road safety transformation partnership board meet quarterly. Supporting the road safety action owners charged with implementing various aspects of the strategy are a number of cross-agency enabler groups, including a legislative enabler group.	spk_40

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-10-25	dail	33	Public Transport: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_15	I am taking this motion on behalf of the Minister for Transport. I thank Deputies for the opportunity to speak to the House about the importance of accessible, affordable and reliable public transport. I am confident we can all agree it is essential that the Government continues to invest in our public transport network and that we are supportive of the Government’s commitment to delivering an accessible, affordable and reliable public transport network throughout the country. While the Government will not oppose the motion and its overall objective is broadly in line with the principles of the Government, it contains some issues that require clarification and they will be highlighted in the ministerial contributions. It is a key Government objective to provide all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options and public transport plays a key role in delivering that. To support this objective, in budget 2022, the Department of Transport secured €538 million in funding for public service obligation, PSO, and Local Link services provided by State operators and under contract by the NTA this year. More recently, €563 million has been secured as part of the budget 2023 negotiations for the continuation of these services. To incentivise young people to use public transport, the Minister for Transport secured funding for the introduction of a young adult card, which allows anyone nationwide between the ages of 19 and 23 to avail of a 50% discount on all PSO services and since September, also on participating commercial services. This initiative was recently widened to allow 16- to 18-year-old third level students to apply for the student Leap card in order that they too can avail of the discount. Furthermore, to combat the rising cost of living being experienced throughout the country, the Government introduced fare reductions of 20% on average on PSO services. Funding has been secured in budget 2023 for the continuation of the young adult card on PSO and commercial services, as well as retaining the 20% average fare discount on PSO services. These fare initiatives are making a significant positive difference to people’s lives throughout the country and their continuation in 2023 represents a significant investment by the taxpayer in public transport. With regard to short-hop zones, given the current cost-of-living crisis and various pressures on the Exchequer throughout the system, budget 2023 is focused on delivering the maximum benefit for all passengers. Funding was directed, therefore, towards the fare initiatives I outlined rather than any narrow application to specific issues that can arise with some fares at the edges of the current short-hop zones. These issues are acknowledged, however, and the NTA is examining what needs to be done to ensure the distance-based fare outside the short-hop zone is in line with the distance-based fare inside the short-hop zone to ensure the fares will be more equitable. This work is ongoing as part of a national fares review for rail and bus services. The Government is committed to providing a comprehensive national transport network that connects our people and places throughout Ireland. For this reason, the Government has an ambitious vision to transform transport services and infrastructure nationwide, with one of the key priorities for public transport being the roll-out of the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan. The House will be aware that Connecting Ireland will significantly increase both the number of routes and the frequency of existing services throughout the country. It aims to enhance existing services and introduce new public transport services. On 19 July, the NTA announced the Connecting Ireland programme’s phase 1 implementation plan, which has delivered a mix of new and enhanced bus services on routes and services serving areas in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Clare, Sligo, Kildare, Offaly, Mayo, Laois, Limerick, Tipperary, Louth and Wexford. Over the coming weeks, the NTA plans to implement improvements to levels of service on a further 14 services throughout the State. Implementation of the programme will continue at the pace outlined by the Government and in line with the funding and operational resources available. Regarding our rail network, the strategic rail review being undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland will inform the development of interurban, interregional rail on the island of Ireland over the coming decades. The review will set the type of strategic backdrop to rail investment in our regions and on our mainline network and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.This review will also consider the potential scope for improved rail services along the various existing or future potential corridors of the network. That scope will include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines. It will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and will provide a framework to develop a much-improved rail network in the years ahead. With regard to the Navan rail line, the NTA's draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area is recommending the development of a rail link to Navan by 2042. This project will require significant planning and design before construction can commence. As it stands, the draft strategy proposes delivery of the Navan rail line in the latter half of the strategy period between 2031 and 2042. With regard to the issue of establishing a dedicated public transport policing unit, as this House will be aware, antisocial behaviour is a broad societal issue we are currently facing to which public transport is not immune. The safety and security of both public transport passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with antisocial behaviour, are important matters that first and foremost must be managed by every public transport company in conjunction with An Garda Síochána, where appropriate. It is important to note that any decisions regarding the establishment of a transport police unit and the allocation of Garda resources are matters for the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner. That said, the NTA regularly engages with public transport operators on the issue of antisocial behaviour and has established a working group on antisocial behaviour that meets monthly to discuss any developing trends among public transport operators and to share best practices. The Minister for Transport is fully committed to strengthening our public transport offerings and progressively making them accessible for all. This requires a whole-journey approach, which refers to all elements that constitute a journey from the starting point to destination. It also means applying the principles of universal design. As the House will be aware, the Department of Transport and its agencies are progressively making public transport accessible for disabled people by ensuring new infrastructure and services are accessible from the start and by retrofitting older infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible. Accessibility features such as wheelchair accessibility and audiovisual aids are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage. Newer systems such as the Luas are fully accessible, as are all new buses purchased by the NTA. The public transport accessibility retrofit programme has increased from an average of €7 million over the past four years to €15.3 million for 2022. This will be used to ensure continued works to improve accessibility at train stations, bus stations and stops. A sum of €18 million has been invested over four years to replace or renovate the lifts at the train stations. All of the major public transport companies consult persons with disabilities, individuals and representative organisations through the companies' disability user groups. The user groups provide a forum for operators to consult and update disability organisations on accessibility proposals and developments and for disability organisations to raise operational and other accessibility issues. With regard to the call for the NTA to exercise its regulatory powers to ensure punctuality, reliability and customer service standards are met by all public transport operators and providers, I would like to clarify that the NTA uses all the contractual and regulatory powers available to it to measure, report on and seek to maintain and improve standards across PSO transport services. In instances where performance drops, financial penalties are rigorously applied unless the cause of the loss of performance is outside of the control of the operator, for example, high levels of Covid sickness absence. In recent months, all bus operators have faced challenges in maintaining adequate staff numbers to cover all requirements. The NTA has worked collaboratively with all operators to try to mitigate the impact of these staff shortages. However, the summer months were challenging, with performance deductions applied to a number of operators, as per all PSO contracts. In recent weeks, performance standards have improved although there remains a shortage of driving and maintenance staff, which will take some time to resolve fully. With regard to PSO contractual arrangements between the NTA and Go-Ahead Ireland, the current contracts with Go-Ahead Ireland are regularly reviewed by the NTA, as with all PSO contracts. Whether tendered or directly awarded, all decisions relating to contract extensions or renewals will be made following a detailed assessment of a number of factors, including the performance of the operator over the duration of the contract in question. On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, this motion is generally in line with the principles of this Government in terms of prioritising investment in the public transport network. As I outlined, however, some elements of the motion do not properly reflect the progress to date in this area, the work currently under way or the Government's future plans for public transport.	spk_310
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-10-12	dail	33	Crime Prevention	dbsect_3	I would like to thank Deputies McAuliffe and Devlin for giving me the opportunity to discuss this issue on behalf of the Minister. I understand that the Deputies' questions are on the ongoing issues with the provision and reliability of bus services provided in Dublin, in particular those services provided by Go-Ahead Ireland. I further understand that the issue of service reliability with Go-Ahead Ireland routes was previously raised by several Deputies in recent weeks during Topical Issue debates and parliamentary questions. The Department has responsibility for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport. However, the Department is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services nationally, including those public service obligation, PSO, routes in Dublin currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland or other operators. It is the NTA that has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport services contracts and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators. As the Deputies know, PSO services are socially necessary but financially unviable services and the PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money. Currently, the vast majority of PSO bus services are provided by either Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann through what are known as direct award contracts. The remaining routes are operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, which entered the market in September 2018 as part of Government's commitment to open up the bus market through a programme of tendering known as bus market opening. A key Government objective is to provide all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and transport plays a key role in delivering this goal. To support this objective, in budget 2022, the Department of Transport secured approximately €538 million of funding for PSO and Local Link services this year. The Department recently secured €563 million in budget 2023 for the continuation of these essential PSO services and for the continuation of both the 20% average fare discount and the young adult card. In the context of the Deputies' specific questions on ongoing issues with the provision and reliability of bus services provided in Dublin, and in particular those provided by Go-Ahead Ireland, the NTA has advised that the performance of all public transport operators is closely monitored by the authority as part of the contractual arrangements in place between it and the operators. Go-Ahead Ireland is not alone in experiencing these issues. Many operators in the public transport sector are facing similar challenges with staffing, both because of Covid-19-related absences and with regard to recruiting new drivers. The public transport industry has been particularly hard hit with driver shortages as operators attempt to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity, as well as deliver intended service improvements. However, while these staffing issues are being experienced across the system by both commercial and PSO operators, it is also true that Go-Ahead Ireland is experiencing higher than normal levels of Covid-related staff absences that are impacting on service delivery, with a number of services not operating as scheduled. I understand that the NTA is working closely with bus operators, including Go-Ahead Ireland, to try to mitigate the impact of the driver shortage through extensive driver recruitment campaigns, engagement with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, regarding the testing and licence process of new bus drivers and by working with the operator to minimise service cancellations, ensure first- and last-service buses operate, and on low-frequency routes to avoid, where possible, the cancellation of consecutive low-frequency services. Before coming into the Chamber, I got updated information from the NTA that Go-Ahead has indicated that it will have the adequate number of drivers by December of this year.	spk_4
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-10-12	dail	33	Crime Prevention	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputies. I will be raising the issues they have raised with the Minister. I want to reassure them that the NTA is engaging regularly with Go-Ahead Ireland and other public transport operators in regard to any service provision issues on the PSO network, and the NTA is providing regular updates to the Department of Transport in regard to these issues. I can also confirm that, as part of the NTA’s contractual performance monitoring system with operators, issues of poor reliability and punctuality performance can result in financial penalties for those operators. As the Deputies have referred to, the NTA formally administers sanctions and penalties. The NTA also formally meets with Go-Ahead on a weekly basis to review performance-associated customer feedback and driver recovery plans, and it will continue to closely monitor the situation. In respect of the specific issues being experienced regarding service reliability, the NTA has advised that it has raised these with Go-Ahead Ireland and will continue to monitor and engage closely with the operator in an effort to improve the situation. As Deputies have noted, penalties were previously applied to Go-Ahead Ireland for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, amounting to €266,968 and €209,188 respectively. Furthermore, public transport operators are forecasting improvements in reliability in the coming months. This will depend on successful recruitment and retention of critical staff, and drivers, in particular. It is hoped that this will help to resolve the current reliability issues being experienced. I will ask the Minister to keep the Deputies updated in regard to the driver shortage.	spk_7
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-10-12	dail	33	Crime Prevention	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to discuss further this issue.I understand that, similar to the issue raised by Deputies McAuliffe and Devlin, this matter relates to ongoing service delivery issues with bus services provided by Go-Ahead Ireland and the urgent need to address these. The Department has responsibility for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport and is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services nationally, including those PSO routes in Dublin currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland and other operators. It is the NTA that has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport services contracts and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators. The majority of PSO bus services are provided by Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann through what are known as direct award contracts, with the remaining routes being operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. The Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal. The recently agreed budget 2023 helps to support this objective and is a further positive development for public transport passengers across the country. We have extended the 20% fare reduction on PSO services so that everyone will benefit until the end of 2023, we have extended the 50% reduction available to young adults on PSO and commercial bus services until the end of 2023, and we are supporting new and enhanced bus and rail services throughout 2023. These are all part of the €563 million funding package to support PSO services. This package is significant in the context of providing accessible and affordable transport options. Regarding the specific question on ongoing service delivery issues with bus services provided by Go-Ahead Ireland and the urgent need to address these issues, the NTA has advised that it is closely monitoring the performance of all public transport operators as part of the contractual arrangements in place between it and the operators. The service reliability issues being experienced by Go-Ahead are not unique to that operator, with many operators in the public transport sector facing similar staffing challenges as a result of Covid-19 absences and the recruitment of new drivers. However, while these staffing issues are being experienced across the public transport system, it is also true that Go-Ahead is particularly impacted by them and is experiencing higher-than-normal levels of Covid-19-related staff absences. These absences are having a knock-on negative impact on the delivery of services, with a number of services not operating as scheduled. The NTA is engaging extensively with Go-Ahead on this issue. Go-Ahead has told the NTA that it will have the full complement of drivers in place by December.	spk_12
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-10-12	dail	33	Crime Prevention	dbsect_3	I will raise the issue with the Minister again. I assure Deputies that the NTA is engaging regularly with Go-Ahead Ireland on the service provision issues currently being experienced on the PSO network. The NTA is also providing regular updates to the Department of Transport on these issues. Regarding poor reliability and punctuality performance issues, they can and have resulted in financial penalties for operators. As part of the performance monitoring process, penalties were applied to Go-Ahead Ireland for the fourth quarter of 2021 and for the first quarter of 2022 at €266,968 and €209,188, respectively. Regarding the specific issues being experienced with service reliability, I assure all Deputies that the NTA has raised these matters with Go-Ahead Ireland and will continue to monitor and engage closely with the operator in an effort to improve the situation. I have no doubt that the Minister will keep Deputies up to date on the driver complement up to December.	spk_19

It is the NTA that has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport services contracts and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators. As the Deputies know, PSO services are socially necessary but financially unviable services and the PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money. Currently, the vast majority of PSO bus services are provided by either Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann through what are known as direct award contracts. The remaining routes are operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, which entered the market in September 2018 as part of Government's commitment to open up the bus market through a programme of tendering known as bus market opening. A key Government objective is to provide all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and transport plays a key role in delivering this goal. To support this objective, in budget 2022, the Department of Transport secured approximately €538 million of funding for PSO and Local Link services this year. The Department recently secured €563 million in budget 2023 for the continuation of these essential PSO services and for the continuation of both the 20% average fare discount and the young adult card. In the context of the Deputies' specific questions on ongoing issues with the provision and reliability of bus services provided in Dublin, and in particular those provided by Go-Ahead Ireland, the NTA has advised that the performance of all public transport operators is closely monitored by the authority as part of the contractual arrangements in place between it and the operators. Go-Ahead Ireland is not alone in experiencing these issues. Many operators in the public transport sector are facing similar challenges with staffing, both because of Covid-19-related absences and with regard to recruiting new drivers. The public transport industry has been particularly hard hit with driver shortages as operators attempt to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity, as well as deliver intended service improvements. However, while these staffing issues are being experienced across the system by both commercial and PSO operators, it is also true that Go-Ahead Ireland is experiencing higher than normal levels of Covid-related staff absences that are impacting on service delivery, with a number of services not operating as scheduled. I understand that the NTA is working closely with bus operators, including Go-Ahead Ireland, to try to mitigate the impact of the driver shortage through extensive driver recruitment campaigns, engagement with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, regarding the testing and licence process of new bus drivers and by working with the operator to minimise service cancellations, ensure first- and last-service buses operate, and on low-frequency routes to avoid, where possible, the cancellation of consecutive low-frequency services. Before coming into the Chamber, I got updated information from the NTA that Go-Ahead has indicated that it will have the adequate number of drivers by December of this year.	spk_4
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-10-12	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_4	I thank the Deputies. I will be raising the issues they have raised with the Minister. I want to reassure them that the NTA is engaging regularly with Go-Ahead Ireland and other public transport operators in regard to any service provision issues on the PSO network, and the NTA is providing regular updates to the Department of Transport in regard to these issues. I can also confirm that, as part of the NTA’s contractual performance monitoring system with operators, issues of poor reliability and punctuality performance can result in financial penalties for those operators. As the Deputies have referred to, the NTA formally administers sanctions and penalties. The NTA also formally meets with Go-Ahead on a weekly basis to review performance-associated customer feedback and driver recovery plans, and it will continue to closely monitor the situation. In respect of the specific issues being experienced regarding service reliability, the NTA has advised that it has raised these with Go-Ahead Ireland and will continue to monitor and engage closely with the operator in an effort to improve the situation. As Deputies have noted, penalties were previously applied to Go-Ahead Ireland for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, amounting to €266,968 and €209,188 respectively. Furthermore, public transport operators are forecasting improvements in reliability in the coming months. This will depend on successful recruitment and retention of critical staff, and drivers, in particular. It is hoped that this will help to resolve the current reliability issues being experienced. I will ask the Minister to keep the Deputies updated in regard to the driver shortage.	spk_7
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-10-12	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_5	I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to discuss further this issue.I understand that, similar to the issue raised by Deputies McAuliffe and Devlin, this matter relates to ongoing service delivery issues with bus services provided by Go-Ahead Ireland and the urgent need to address these. The Department has responsibility for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport and is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services nationally, including those PSO routes in Dublin currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland and other operators. It is the NTA that has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport services contracts and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators. The majority of PSO bus services are provided by Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann through what are known as direct award contracts, with the remaining routes being operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. The Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal. The recently agreed budget 2023 helps to support this objective and is a further positive development for public transport passengers across the country. We have extended the 20% fare reduction on PSO services so that everyone will benefit until the end of 2023, we have extended the 50% reduction available to young adults on PSO and commercial bus services until the end of 2023, and we are supporting new and enhanced bus and rail services throughout 2023. These are all part of the €563 million funding package to support PSO services. This package is significant in the context of providing accessible and affordable transport options. Regarding the specific question on ongoing service delivery issues with bus services provided by Go-Ahead Ireland and the urgent need to address these issues, the NTA has advised that it is closely monitoring the performance of all public transport operators as part of the contractual arrangements in place between it and the operators. The service reliability issues being experienced by Go-Ahead are not unique to that operator, with many operators in the public transport sector facing similar staffing challenges as a result of Covid-19 absences and the recruitment of new drivers. However, while these staffing issues are being experienced across the public transport system, it is also true that Go-Ahead is particularly impacted by them and is experiencing higher-than-normal levels of Covid-19-related staff absences. These absences are having a knock-on negative impact on the delivery of services, with a number of services not operating as scheduled. The NTA is engaging extensively with Go-Ahead on this issue. Go-Ahead has told the NTA that it will have the full complement of drivers in place by December.	spk_12
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-10-12	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_5	I will raise the issue with the Minister again. I assure Deputies that the NTA is engaging regularly with Go-Ahead Ireland on the service provision issues currently being experienced on the PSO network. The NTA is also providing regular updates to the Department of Transport on these issues. Regarding poor reliability and punctuality performance issues, they can and have resulted in financial penalties for operators. As part of the performance monitoring process, penalties were applied to Go-Ahead Ireland for the fourth quarter of 2021 and for the first quarter of 2022 at €266,968 and €209,188, respectively. Regarding the specific issues being experienced with service reliability, I assure all Deputies that the NTA has raised these matters with Go-Ahead Ireland and will continue to monitor and engage closely with the operator in an effort to improve the situation. I have no doubt that the Minister will keep Deputies up to date on the driver complement up to December.	spk_19
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-09-28	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 6: General (Resumed)	dbsect_19	This is a budget that invests in essential infrastructure of all modes of travel and supports greater safety and sustainability. It supports the protection and renewal of our national, regional and local roads and in the case of regional and local roads, enhances walking and cycling options along these roads. It supports regional connectivity and promotes maritime safety and security. As Minister of State with responsibility for road safety, I was very pleased last week to open officially the new safe routes to school programme at An Mhodhscoil in Limerick city, which will help make the journeys to school for pupils safer to walk, cycle or scoot. This project was delivered under the safe routes to school programme, which will be continued into 2023. It is part of this Government's commitment to spend almost €1 million per day on walking and cycling infrastructure throughout the country. I am also particularly pleased to have secured funding to allow a significant piece of research to take place to understand the barriers and encourage more young girls, particularly adolescents, to choose cycling. I sincerely hope we can instil long-term habits that will benefit not just our environment but also the health and well-being of women of tomorrow. We have a maritime budget of €109 million, which will be allocated in 2023. As we mark 200 years this year of the Irish Coast Guard, we continue to look to the future of our service. This is a critical service carried out by hundreds of volunteers around the country in our coastal immunities. Funding will be provided to enhance building and IT programmes as well as investment in the search and rescue service, including training and equipment, providing the coastguard with the tools and technology necessary to support it in serving our citizens. The haulage and logistics sector is one that has ensured our supermarket shelves have remained stocked and that our pharmacies were equipped with medicines and other key products that continued to be available for families, communities and businesses. The haulage sector did this flawlessly as Ireland navigated the turbulent waters of Brexit and Covid-19. Earlier this year, Government put in place a significant support package for the haulage sector to help meet the increased costs of doing business. I hope to be in a position to announce further supports for our hauliers in the coming weeks. In recognition of the importance of our regional airports in supporting connectivity to the regions and enhancing balanced regional development, the Government has sustained the substantial high level of supports to regional airports since the onset of Covid-19 throughout the recovery of the aviation sector. A total package of €36 million was also announced in yesterday's budget. Funding of €30 million will be provided in 2023 to support regional airports under the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025. This programme will deliver €16 million in current funding and €14 million in capital funding, which will support our regional airports of Shannon Airport, Ireland West Airport Knock, Donegal Airport and Kerry Airport. This programme also funds Exchequer-funded public service obligation, PSO, air services between Donegal and Dublin. Following an extensive procurement process, a new PSO air services contract came into effect this year, marking the Government's commitment to ensuring continued connectivity to this region. In addition and in recognition of the important role of Cork Airport to the economy of the south and nationally, capital funding of €6 million will be provided to Cork Airport in 2023. This funding will support the commencement of a significant security screening project at Cork Airport next year. This funding is consistent with the programme for Government action to deliver capital programmes required to support services and ensure the safety of our State and regional airports. Budget 2023 includes €10 million to strengthen Ireland's post office network. I am acutely aware of the importance of supporting our 900-strong post offices throughout the country, which play a vital role in community life in our towns, villages and cities throughout the country. The funding announced in this budget marks the first time in the history of the Government where we are providing direct financial support to our postmasters. It will give them certainty and stability, allowing them to plan and develop their services. This is part of a €30 million three-year funding package that recognises the central role they play in our communities and ensures families and businesses can continue to access public services close to where they live.	spk_312
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-09-15	dail	33	Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_36	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" On behalf of the Minister for Health, I am pleased to address the House on the Bill, which is fundamentally about health practitioners, the individuals who work tirelessly to deliver the health and social care services on which we, as patients, rely. It is about ensuring we have a safe workforce, that patients are protected and that if a complaint is made, it can be investigated as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. In Ireland, our regulated health professionals are governed by six regulatory bodies, two of which, the Medical Council and CORU - Regulating Health & Social Care Professionals, are the subject of the measures in this Bill. When it comes to setting the standards for education, training experience and practice for the respective professions, the regulators are the experts. They also have responsibility for taking action if a complaint is made. The measures proposed in the Bill are very much guided by the advice given to the Department of Health by the regulators. I will provide a brief overview of the most important measures the Bill addresses before discussing them in more detail. As Deputies will be aware, social care work is one of the professions that CORU is in the process of regulating. Measures in this Bill will ensure that when the social care workers registration board opens, those applying for registration during the transition period will have to meet the same standards that applied to CORU's other professions. The Bill also addresses a number of issues relating to medical practitioners. First, it will enable holders of UK medical degrees to once again apply for intern registration with the Medical Council. This, in turn, will allow these graduates to take up an offer by the HSE of an intern training post in an Irish hospital were such an offer to be made. It also addresses several of the technical issues related to the registration of doctors. The Bill will also support the complaints investigation function of the Medical Council by allowing the CEO to appoint external experts to provide advice and assistance. To address these issues, it is necessary to amend three separate Acts: the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005; Medical Practitioners Act 2007; and Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Act 2020. Before explaining the Bill’s provisions in more detail, I will provide the House with some background regarding each of the Acts being amended. The Health and Social Care Professionals Act currently provides for the statutory regulation of 12 professions, with a further six professions, including social care workers, to be regulated. Regulation under the Act is mainly achieved by protection of professional titles. This means that only someone who is on the register for a profession may call themselves by that title. For example, if someone calls himself or herself a physiotherapist and he or she is not on the register, he or she has committed an offence and may be prosecuted. The Act established registration boards, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters and a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system. These bodies are collectively known as CORU and are responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland. The Medical Practitioners Act provides for the regulation of doctors in the State. One of the council's main responsibilities is the registration of medical practitioners. It holds the register, determines the divisions and sets the terms and conditions that doctors must meet to secure and retain registration. The council is also responsible for the investigation of complaints against registered doctors. While the council performs other functions, these two primary functions are central to its overall patient safety objective. The Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Act is long and technical legislation which was enacted in October 2020. It amends the five Acts that regulate health professionals working in the State. These amendments are mainly in the areas of registration and fitness to practise. The Act introduced important new patient safety measures that create more robust obligations on health professionals. It also provides greater protections for those professionals working within our hospitals and communities. As the 2020 Act is bringing about significant changes to administrative processes, its sections are being commenced on a phased business. This is to ensure each of the regulators is in a position to begin operating under the changed systems. Of the five Acts amended by the 2020 Act, the Medical Practitioners Act saw the most significant changes to its provisions on registration and investigation of complaints systems. Prior to commencing the sections of the 2020 Act, my officials carried out a final, thorough review to ensure the complex amendments being activated were correct. Unfortunately, during the checking process, some technical problems were found in provisions relating to the Medical Practitioners Act. If commenced, these would have prevented certain groups of doctors who had trained in two or more countries from joining the general division of the register. This Bill will amend those sections to ensure they operate correctly and those difficulties are avoided. I will outline some main provisions of the Bill in more detail. It has four Parts and contains 14 sections. Part 1 provides for standard provisions, including the Short Title, commencement and definitions. Parts 2 to 4, inclusive, provide for the amendments to the three Acts to which I referred. As I mentioned, CORU currently regulates 12 professionals and a further six are soon to be regulated. Each of the professions has its own registration board, which is responsible for the registration of members of the profession. The initial two years after a register is opened are known as the transition period. During this period, existing practitioners can apply for registration if they satisfy a registration board that they meet certain criteria. These criteria include either a requirement to hold an approved qualification or completing what is known as an assessment of professional competence set by a registration board. In addition, applicants must provide evidence of two years of professional practice as a member of the profession. Social care workers are designated in the 2005 Act as a profession to be regulated by CORU and work is ongoing by its social care workers registration board to open the register for the profession in November 2023. When the 2005 Act was drafted, it provided certain unique provisions for social care workers applying for registration during the transitional period. For example, the Act provides that the registration board must register any applicant who has been practising the profession of social care work anywhere in the world for a continuous period of two years and whose employer states that he or she meets the standards for that profession. CORU has significant concerns that this is simply not safe for patients. Protection of vulnerable patients must always be our focus and it is clear that the measures sought by CORU, which bring social care workers into line with other professions, are necessary and proportionate. This amendment will align the registration route requirements during the transitional period across all the CORU professions. It will require social care workers applying through this route to complete successfully an assessment of professional competence set by their registration board. The change will mean the registration board can stand over those applying to be placed on the register on the basis of their training and experience. It will also require that the necessary two-year minimum period of practice must be obtained within the State, as is required for other CORU professions. Currently, other CORU professions can accumulate their work experience in a non-continuous way. Periods can be added together to reach the minimum threshold of two years. This work experience must be gained in the five-year period before the register is established. Uniquely for social care workers, the Act requires that their two years' work experience be continuous. This Bill will remove that requirement and non-continuous experience will now be allowed. This harmonises social care workers with other CORU professionals. However, in order to assist social care workers, it has been decided to retain a provision in the 2005 Act that gives them an additional two years to gain the minimum practical experience to be registered. Instead of needing two years' professional experience prior to the date the register is established, they will have the option of gaining this experience in the two years afterwards. This amendment will, in effect, allow those who wish to register as social care workers until the end of the transition period, which is expected to be in November 2025, to gain two years of professional practice. This is an important support that will give social care workers every opportunity to meet the requirements for registration. It will also better achieve the objective of the transitional period, which is to ensure patient safety, balancing that with the rights of practitioners. Following the opening of a register, there is, as I said, a two-year transitional period to allow existing practitioners time to apply for registration and satisfy the registration board they meet the requirements. Practitioners can do this by way of attesting to professional experience or by holding a qualification that is acceptable for registration for existing practitioners during the transitional period. Schedule 3 to the 2005 Act lists these qualifications. However, Schedule 3 was drafted 17 years ago and, as Deputies will appreciate, some of its content is now out of date for professions that have not yet opened a register. It is important that the Schedule can be kept up to date. Therefore, the Bill includes a provision that will allow the Minister for Health to add to or amend the qualifications list in Schedule 3. This provision will help to future-proof the Act and will ensure the necessary powers are in place to prescribe or vary the qualifications that are acceptable for practitioners. The remainder of the Bill addresses issues relating to medical practitioners and the operation of the Medical Practitioners Act, the first of which relates to the investigation of complaints. The 2020 Act revised and updated the procedures to be used in the investigation of complaints against doctors. Those investigations have typically taken quite a long time, which can cause distress for both complainants and doctors. The changes are intended to make investigations more efficient and speedier, which will be welcomed by both doctors and complainants. One of the most significant changes is that complaints will now be made to the CEO rather than to the preliminary proceedings committee. Investigations will be carried out by authorised officers appointed by the CEO. The preliminary proceedings committee will continue to be the deciding body when an investigation report is produced. However, the changes mean that a significant amount of progress can be made by authorised officers before a committee meets. The Irish Medical Council is confident this will be a more efficient system and a better use of resources. However, the Department of Health has been advised by the council that the triage of early stages of investigations of complaints is often complex and requires specialist expertise. It is important that the CEO and the authorised officers have access to the medical and other expertise necessary to discharge their functions properly at the right stage in the complaints process. The Bill, therefore, provides a power for the CEO to appoint certain experts and specialists to support the council, as well as making some minor amendments to the powers of authorised officers. These amendments will ensure the investigation function is properly supported with the resources and expertise it needs, all of which goes towards the overarching objective of promoting public protection. The appointment of external support requires a consequential amendment to the 2007 Act, which provides immunity from liability in civil proceedings for members of the Irish Medical Council, the CEO, members of staff and certain persons appointed to assist with the investigation of complaints against doctors. I understand this is a common protection provided for those working in this area. The 2020 Act and the other provisions of the Bill I have described expand the cohort of people who can be appointed to assist the council in the performance of its functions. As Deputies will appreciate, some of the work carried out by regulators is highly contested and often results in legal proceedings. This amendment is necessary to ensure all of those who are properly appointed under the Act can carry out their work without fear of liability in civil litigation. I turn to an amendment relating to the eligibility of holders of UK medical degrees to apply for internship registration and internship posts in Ireland. The Medical Practitioners Act currently restricts internship registration to graduates who have completed a course of study in the State or a member state. Prior to Brexit, holders of UK medical degrees, by virtue of the UK being a member state, were able to apply for internships in Ireland. For the past two years, the Act has prevented those graduates from applying. We have a long history in Ireland of our health and social care workers travelling back and forth to the UK to study and work. This has been mutually beneficial to both countries and it is important that those strong ties continue.While I understand the number of UK graduates who take up an intern placement here is typically low, it is nevertheless important that this option remains available. Deputies will be aware that under the common travel area agreement, Irish and British citizens have the right to access all levels of education and training, and associated student support, in each other's state on terms no less favourable than those for the citizen of that state. While the number of graduates currently affected might be small, it is important that the letter and spirit of that agreement be fully respected. Deputies will be aware there are new opportunities for medical education in Northern Ireland with the opening of Ulster University's Magee campus school of medicine. It is imperative, therefore, that graduates from Northern Ireland be eligible to apply for intern placements here. The restoration of eligibility is something the Minister very much supports, as does the HSE and the Irish Medical Council. I understand the application window for next year's group of interns will close before the end of this year, so the support of colleagues to progress the Bill as quickly as possible through the Houses will be greatly appreciated. The final element of the Bill relates to the registration of doctors on the Irish Medical Council's general division. The 2020 Act significantly revised the registration system for doctors by separating qualification recognition from registration. This was to enable the Medical Council to introduce important safeguards between qualification recognition and registration, such as language and fit-and-proper-person tests. The Act also sets out the requirement to be met for recognition of qualifications and registration on all divisions of the register. These provisions are highly technical, cross-cutting and complex and it was only during the checking process to ensure the Act's safe commencement that Department of Health officials identified difficulties for a small cohort of internationally trained doctors who were inadvertently excluded. Were the 2020 Act to be commenced without revision, these doctors would have no route to qualification recognition and registration on the general division. In some instances, they would be unnecessarily required to sit an additional exam. The Minister for Health is acutely aware that the Irish health service is supported by highly skilled and caring doctors from across the world. It is therefore important to ensure the Medical Practitioners Act continues to support the registration of doctors who meet the appropriate standards. The Bill will change the 2020 Act to ensure no doctors will be unintentionally affected. It is important to say no doctors have been affected by this anomaly, as it was detected prior to the sections of the 2020 Act being commenced.  This Bill includes some consequential and other technical amendments but the provisions I have outlined are the principal issues. On behalf of my colleagues and the Minister for Health, I look forward to hearing Deputies' views and discussing it further"	spk_467
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-09-15	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_37	I am taking this issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Tackling illegal dumping and other waste crime is a priority for the Minister and his Department, which continues to provide substantial support to local authorities dealing with challenging waste enforcement cases.The operation has resulted in the impounding of vehicles used for alleged unauthorised waste activities and the initiation of prosecutions. There are also investigations under way by DCC, with the assistance of An Garda Síochána, into ongoing breaches of the Waste Management Act 1996. Patrols, together with regular clean-up and maintenance operations by DCC, are continuing. The ultimate objective is to clean up and secure the site as part of an overall and sustainable solution, which will include the development of the site and surrounding area by DCC. Specialist environmental consultants have been engaged by DCC to undertake environmental assessments to gauge the scale and types of waste involved and the subsequent means and level of clean-up that might be required. The clean-up of this site will be carried out in conjunction with the overall development of the area by DCC. Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications officials will receive further reports from DCC, via the NWESC, as this progresses. In the interim, DCC is actively engaged at a senior level with An Garda Síochána in ongoing efforts to eliminate illegal dumping in this area. Both the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I are fully aware of the challenges that illegal dumping poses to our regulatory authorities and the impact it has on communities. I will be raising this directly with the Minister.	spk_469

While enforcement action in this area is a matter for the local authorities, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications encourages a multifaceted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education. In that context, the Department provides significant funding to support the activities of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities and the network of local authority waste enforcement officers. In addition, the Department has developed the anti-dumping initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high-risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations. I will raise this directly with the Minister and come back to the Deputy on progress on this.	spk_471
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-09-15	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_37	"I am taking this issue on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan. The Derrybrien wind farm was first referred by the European Commission to the Court of Justice of the EU in 2006, case C-215/06, and has been the subject of infringement proceedings, and the subject of a lump sum fine of €5 million and significant daily fines of €15,000 per day until the terms of the judgment are met, as a result of same. To comply with the judgment, the intention was for the operator of the wind farm, an ESB subsidiary, to apply under amendments to the Planning and Development Act for ""substitute consent"", that is, planning permission for development requiring retrospective environmental impact assessment, following a request to make the application from the local authority, Galway County Council. ESB lodged its application for substitute consent with An Bord Pleanála for the Derrybrien wind farm on 21 August 2020. On 4 February 2022, An Bord Pleanála decided to refuse to grant substitute consent for the wind farm development at Derrybrien. On 15 February 2022, ESB paused the operation of the wind farm at Derrybrien following the decision by An Bord Pleanála to refuse to grant substitute consent. On 16 March 2022, ESB confirmed that it has decided to close the Derrybrien wind farm on a permanent basis. The statutory timeframe for other potential objectors to bring judicial review proceedings in this matter has now expired. On foot of the refusal by An Bord Pleanála to grant substitute consent for the wind farm, the environmental impact assessment, EIA, regularisation process for the Derrybrien wind farm has ended and the development is now deemed by primary legislation to be an unauthorised development. Section 177O(5) of the Planning Act is very explicit insofar as Derrybrien is now classed as an unauthorised development and the cessation of the activity is required. Any attempt to keep the wind farm operational would, therefore, be unlawful. It is, therefore, subject to mandatory planning enforcement by the relevant planning authority, Galway County Council, which will carry out this function in accordance with its statutory responsibilities. There is no legal basis for Derrybrien's continued operation. It is very important in the context of compliance with EU law that immediate steps are taken to ensure the plant is decommissioned as quickly as possible, and discontinuation of the unauthorised wind farm should be a key factor in seeking to end Ireland’s liability to pay significant daily fines to the European Commission. Government officials are engaging with the Commission in this regard. It is the Government's view that the An Bord Pleanála decision and the acceptance of the ESB of this decision and its stated intention to decommission Derrybrien brings the State into compliance with the original judgment. The full impacts of the closure of Derrybrien wind farm have been considered. There are limited global and European energy policy arguments to be made for the continued operation of Derrybrien. There are no substantive arguments to be made from a domestic security of supply perspective. Any attempts to retain the wind farm in operation would face planning and legal obstacles."	spk_473
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-09-15	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_37	The ESB is a commercial State company. It has accepted the decision of An Bord Pleanála and is in the process of preparing for the decommissioning and removal of the wind farm. As previously stated, the Government has explored all avenues and impacts in this regard and is satisfied that there is no legal basis for its continued operation. The Government is committed to pursuing the transition to a climate-resilient, biodiversity-rich and climate-neutral economy by no later than the end of the year 2050, as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. Under the climate action plan 2021, CAP21, and the sectoral emissions ceilings, Ireland has a target of up to 80% of electricity demand to come from renewable energy sources by 2030. This will be comprised of up to 8 GW of onshore wind, up to 5.5 GW of solar and at least 7 GW of offshore, with 2 GW earmarked for the supply of green hydrogen. Under the EU clean energy package, Ireland has to maintain a baseline 16% renewable energy level in each year and meet trajectory points in 2022, 2025, 2027 and 2030, as set out in the national energy and climate plan. Under CAP21, at least a further 4 GW of additional onshore wind energy is required without taking into account the potential decommissioning of existing sites over the coming years. According to industry sources, there is an estimated 10 GW of onshore wind projects in the development pipeline. A supportive spatial planning framework for further onshore renewable development at national, regional and local level, as set out in the climate action plan, is essential to deliver on the onshore and solar generation targets.	spk_475
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-09-15	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_37	I thank Deputy Ó Cathasaigh for raising this important topic, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan. As the Deputy will be aware, while the majority of public transport in Ireland is provided by the publicly-subvented bus and rail services funded through NTA's public service obligation, PSO, programme, the public transport system also includes non-subvented bus services provided on a commercial basis by bus and coach businesses of varying size. I understand the Deputy's question concerns the impact on the people of Dunmore East, Portlaw and Passage East in County Waterford of the recent decision by one such commercial bus operator, Suirway, to cease operating its services in the area. I advise the Deputy that the decision taken by Suirway to withdraw its commuter services in east Waterford, including in Dunmore East, Portlaw and Passage East, at the end of October, is a commercial decision for the company. The Deputy will appreciate that Suirway, like all other commercial businesses, is responsible for managing its own resources in respect of its commercial services. It is my understanding that Suirway has taken the decision to withdraw these services following a prolonged period of difficult trading. The Deputy eloquently outlined the history of the company in the area and the difficulties it has been facing. He will also be aware that the Covid-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the public transport sector. This impact has been mitigated by several Government decisions over the last two years. In particular, these include the decision to substantially increase the 2020, 2021 and 2022 budgets for the existing PSO system and to introduce new, temporary financial support for non-PSO licensed services provided by commercial bus operators in June 2020. In acknowledgment of the difficulties facing the sector, these supports for the commercial sector were extended several times over the past two years, most recently up to 30 June 2022. Despite these and other wider Governmental supports, trading conditions remain challenging, with passenger numbers remaining below pre-pandemic levels in many areas and the associated fare revenue having yet to rebound fully. An unfortunate consequence of these challenging conditions is that some commercial operators, such as Suirway, are deciding to leave the market. I advise the Deputy that the NTA, which has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport services contracts and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators, will assess whether Suirway's decision to withdraw its services in Dunmore East, Portlaw and Passage East at the end of next month will give rise to any loss of connectivity in the area. The NTA will also consider whether there is a need to provide additional PSO services in the affected areas. I reassure the Deputy that the NTA has advised that this matter is a high priority for it and that it will advise the Department of its findings as soon as its review process is complete. I also assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring essential transport services are protected and supported. Services providing vital regional and rural connections will continue to operate if a loss of connectivity is identified, and a replacement service will be put in place. A key Government objective is to provide all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal.	spk_477
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-09-15	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_37	I raised this issue regarding the timeline with the Minister to try to get clarity for the Deputy. Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, especially in areas not covered by existing public service bus and rail services. While it is regrettable that a family-owned bus operator like Suirway, which has been providing services in the east Waterford area for more than 100 years, is ceasing its operations, I reiterate that any decision concerning the continuation or cessation of specific routes or services by a commercial operator is, ultimately, a decision for the company itself. I again assure the Deputy that the NTA has prioritised carrying out a detailed assessment of whether Suirway's decision to withdraw its services in Dunmore East, Portlaw and Passage East at the end of October will result in any loss of connectivity in the area. As part of this assessment process, the NTA will consider whether there is a need to provide additional or replacement PSO services in the area.Regarding alternative transport options in the region, the NTA has also advised that passengers travelling from Kilmeaden to Waterford city will still be able to access Bus Éireann Expressway route 40, which runs six times daily each way along this route. I trust this clarifies the position regarding the impact of the closure of Suirway's bus services on the people of Dunmore East, Portlaw and Passage East. I will raise the issue of the timeline in this regard directly with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.	spk_479
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-09-15	dail	33	Waste Management	dbsect_38	I am taking this issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Tackling illegal dumping and other waste crime is a priority for the Minister and his Department, which continues to provide substantial support to local authorities dealing with challenging waste enforcement cases.The operation has resulted in the impounding of vehicles used for alleged unauthorised waste activities and the initiation of prosecutions. There are also investigations under way by DCC, with the assistance of An Garda Síochána, into ongoing breaches of the Waste Management Act 1996. Patrols, together with regular clean-up and maintenance operations by DCC, are continuing. The ultimate objective is to clean up and secure the site as part of an overall and sustainable solution, which will include the development of the site and surrounding area by DCC. Specialist environmental consultants have been engaged by DCC to undertake environmental assessments to gauge the scale and types of waste involved and the subsequent means and level of clean-up that might be required. The clean-up of this site will be carried out in conjunction with the overall development of the area by DCC. Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications officials will receive further reports from DCC, via the NWESC, as this progresses. In the interim, DCC is actively engaged at a senior level with An Garda Síochána in ongoing efforts to eliminate illegal dumping in this area. Both the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I are fully aware of the challenges that illegal dumping poses to our regulatory authorities and the impact it has on communities. I will be raising this directly with the Minister.	spk_469

While enforcement action in this area is a matter for the local authorities, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications encourages a multifaceted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education. In that context, the Department provides significant funding to support the activities of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities and the network of local authority waste enforcement officers. In addition, the Department has developed the anti-dumping initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high-risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations. I will raise this directly with the Minister and come back to the Deputy on progress on this.	spk_471
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-09-15	dail	33	Wind Energy Generation	dbsect_39	"I am taking this issue on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan. The Derrybrien wind farm was first referred by the European Commission to the Court of Justice of the EU in 2006, case C-215/06, and has been the subject of infringement proceedings, and the subject of a lump sum fine of €5 million and significant daily fines of €15,000 per day until the terms of the judgment are met, as a result of same. To comply with the judgment, the intention was for the operator of the wind farm, an ESB subsidiary, to apply under amendments to the Planning and Development Act for ""substitute consent"", that is, planning permission for development requiring retrospective environmental impact assessment, following a request to make the application from the local authority, Galway County Council. ESB lodged its application for substitute consent with An Bord Pleanála for the Derrybrien wind farm on 21 August 2020. On 4 February 2022, An Bord Pleanála decided to refuse to grant substitute consent for the wind farm development at Derrybrien. On 15 February 2022, ESB paused the operation of the wind farm at Derrybrien following the decision by An Bord Pleanála to refuse to grant substitute consent. On 16 March 2022, ESB confirmed that it has decided to close the Derrybrien wind farm on a permanent basis. The statutory timeframe for other potential objectors to bring judicial review proceedings in this matter has now expired. On foot of the refusal by An Bord Pleanála to grant substitute consent for the wind farm, the environmental impact assessment, EIA, regularisation process for the Derrybrien wind farm has ended and the development is now deemed by primary legislation to be an unauthorised development. Section 177O(5) of the Planning Act is very explicit insofar as Derrybrien is now classed as an unauthorised development and the cessation of the activity is required. Any attempt to keep the wind farm operational would, therefore, be unlawful. It is, therefore, subject to mandatory planning enforcement by the relevant planning authority, Galway County Council, which will carry out this function in accordance with its statutory responsibilities. There is no legal basis for Derrybrien's continued operation. It is very important in the context of compliance with EU law that immediate steps are taken to ensure the plant is decommissioned as quickly as possible, and discontinuation of the unauthorised wind farm should be a key factor in seeking to end Ireland’s liability to pay significant daily fines to the European Commission. Government officials are engaging with the Commission in this regard. It is the Government's view that the An Bord Pleanála decision and the acceptance of the ESB of this decision and its stated intention to decommission Derrybrien brings the State into compliance with the original judgment. The full impacts of the closure of Derrybrien wind farm have been considered. There are limited global and European energy policy arguments to be made for the continued operation of Derrybrien. There are no substantive arguments to be made from a domestic security of supply perspective. Any attempts to retain the wind farm in operation would face planning and legal obstacles."	spk_473
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-09-15	dail	33	Wind Energy Generation	dbsect_39	The ESB is a commercial State company. It has accepted the decision of An Bord Pleanála and is in the process of preparing for the decommissioning and removal of the wind farm. As previously stated, the Government has explored all avenues and impacts in this regard and is satisfied that there is no legal basis for its continued operation. The Government is committed to pursuing the transition to a climate-resilient, biodiversity-rich and climate-neutral economy by no later than the end of the year 2050, as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. Under the climate action plan 2021, CAP21, and the sectoral emissions ceilings, Ireland has a target of up to 80% of electricity demand to come from renewable energy sources by 2030. This will be comprised of up to 8 GW of onshore wind, up to 5.5 GW of solar and at least 7 GW of offshore, with 2 GW earmarked for the supply of green hydrogen. Under the EU clean energy package, Ireland has to maintain a baseline 16% renewable energy level in each year and meet trajectory points in 2022, 2025, 2027 and 2030, as set out in the national energy and climate plan. Under CAP21, at least a further 4 GW of additional onshore wind energy is required without taking into account the potential decommissioning of existing sites over the coming years.

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-07-12	dail	33	Confidence in Government: Motion	dbsect_19	Last February, Sinn Féin promised that every individual with an income of up to €30,000 would receive a cash payment of €200 and those earning between €30,000 and €60,000 would receive a cash payment of €100. I have costed that measure using 2020 Revenue figures. It is a promise of €310 million. Nowhere was that promise costed or an explanation given as to where the money would come from. Sinn Féin also promised to put one month's rent back into renters' pockets, another slogan without any substance. I have also costed that promise using ESRI figures. It is a promise worth €854 million. Again, it is not costed. No explanation is given as to where the money will come from. Sinn Féin would abolish carbon tax, which raises approximately €500 million per year. That revenue goes towards the retrofitting of homes and helps farmers to decarbonise, helps with a just transition, not only for the midlands but throughout the country, and helps alleviate fuel poverty. In total, in a series of promises, there is uncosted and unexplained spending of more than €1.6 billion in one press release alone. Being in government is about having discipline, making tough decisions and telling the public what is possible as opposed to what is popular. Government cannot run on slogans or irresponsible spending commitments. Sinn Féin Deputies are like the Muppets, Statler and Waldorf, heckling from their balcony and offering absolutely no viable solutions for the people.	spk_417
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-07-06	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_3	I welcome the opportunity to update the House on this topic. As Deputies are aware, the Government last week supported a request for members of the Defence Forces to undergo appropriate training and certification to enable them to be on standby to assist the DAA with security activities at Dublin Airport, if required, over the coming peak summer weeks. Putting this emergency contingency measure in place does not mean that members of the Defence Forces will automatically be deployed to the airport. Instead, they will be ready for deployment if required by the DAA. This decision comes on foot of a proposal from the DAA for the potential deployment of the Defence Forces as a prudent step primarily because of the risk of the resurgence of Covid-19 and the effect that could have on its staff and the operations at this exceptionally busy time. During the Omicron wave in early 2022, more than one in four Dublin Airport security staff were absent. Given the high numbers going through the airport every day any recurrence of such high absence levels could have a significant impact on the airport’s continued ability to process passengers through security. The programme for Government acknowledges the value of aviation in supporting economic development, international connectivity and tourism via our airports. In view of this the Government is committed to do what is necessary to ensure that flights do not need to be cancelled at Dublin Airport, as has been the case at other European airports, and that passengers have the assurance that they will not miss their holidays or other travel arrangements where they arrive at the airport within the advised timeframes. On foot of the Government decision, the Defence Forces will be available on standby from this week for a defined period over the peak summer months. This is a short-term emergency-related contingency measure to protect passengers’ travel arrangements as well as to avoid reputational damage to Ireland’s aviation sector. Training and certification of the Defence Forces will be appropriate to the assigned aviation security tasks but will take account of the existing training and skills of Defence Force personnel. If deployed, members of the Defence Forces will be involved in specific, non-public-facing roles, relieving DAA staff for security and screening duties in the main terminals. In the event of significant staff shortages due to Covid-19 it is envisaged that the Defence Forces personnel could be deployed to operate the external gate posts into the security-restricted area of Dublin Airport, thereby potentially freeing up approximately 100 staff who could be deployed to the main terminals. The exact number of Defence Force personnel who will be trained and available to undertake these roles is being finalised. It is expected that 130 personnel will be involved.As this is purely a contingency measure, while members of the Defence Forces will be deployed, they will only be deployed to Dublin Airport if requested by the DAA and in a scenario where there is a significant deterioration in passenger queuing times, with a risk of large numbers of passengers missing their flights. Regarding longer-term security resourcing at Dublin Airport, I reassure Deputies that this emergency measure will not take away from the DAA's plans for the recruitment and training of additional security staff. The DAA is continuing in this regard, with the expectation that optimal staffing levels will be realised by August. The DAA has advised that, by that time, 480 new security staff will have commenced employment at the airport since October 2021. As a precautionary measure, particularly in the context of the ongoing uncertainty regarding the impact of Covid-19 on the availability of staff, this level of resourcing includes additional staff over and above the 2019 staffing levels. Passenger numbers at Dublin Airport are now at over 90% of the 2019 levels, and it is expected that approximately 50,000 people will travel through Dublin Airport every day during the coming peak period. The DAA's ongoing recruitment campaign, supported by this emergency contingency measure, will ensure that passengers can travel safely through Dublin Airport over the busy summer period ahead.	spk_3

When we look at what the CEO said to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications several weeks ago regarding the projections concerning aviation passenger numbers, if he knew then what he knows now regarding the pickup in the numbers of passengers travelling, then he would have made different decisions. Additionally, since the removal of Covid-19-related travel restrictions in March 2022, there has been a significant recovery in aviation passenger numbers throughout Europe. Between January and June 2022, passenger numbers at Dublin Airport have increased from approximately 200,000 per week to almost 650,000 per week, which represents a 220% increase in passenger traffic over five months. As of last week, the airport has been processing almost 90% of 2019 passenger levels. While welcome, the pace of recovery is proving to be extremely challenging operationally for the aviation industry. Industry forecasts had predicted that this level of recovery would not occur until 2024 or 2025.

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-07-01	dail	33	Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Second Stage	dbsect_2	I thank the Minister for Justice for bringing this important Bill before the House. The Bill represents a comprehensive and co-ordinated Government response to address a number of important issues flowing from the Ukraine crisis. I will speak about Parts 6 and 7. Part 6 puts the licensed haulage emergency support scheme on a legislative footing. This scheme provided emergency financial support to the licensed haulage sector following the sharp and sudden increase in fuel prices in March 2022 caused by the war in Ukraine and actions arising from it. Part 7 will provide the Minister for Transport with the power to issue an order that will allow people - not just Ukrainians - admitted to the State under a temporary protection directive, as per section 60 of the International Protection Act 2015, to drive here on their national driving licence without the need to exchange the licence for the period of temporary protection. Brexit and Covid-19 have shown the importance of the Government taking appropriate and timely actions to safeguard our essential sectors from external shocks. While the Ukraine crisis is of an entirely different nature, the same principle is true. Our licensed haulage sector plays an invaluable role in facilitating our normal day-to-day lives. We rely on it for the delivery of foods and goods, including essential items, into and around the State. The sector is of national strategic importance. It is a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, helping to support key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. Therefore, on 15 March 2022, in response to increasing fuel costs resulting from the Ukraine crisis, the Minister for Transport and I proposed to the Government an emergency support measure for the sector. The licensed haulage emergency support scheme provided a support of €100 per week for eight weeks for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. The scheme was administered by my Department and was open for applications between 5 April and 6 June 2022.It is now closed. The scheme was an important and responsive measure that enabled the Government to act quickly to provide short-term financial support to the sector, helping to ensure the continued operation of the national haulage fleet by assisting eligible operators with cost pressures, ensuring liquidity for business and compensating operators for the additional costs incurred due to the increased fuel prices. Over €15 million in grants has been made available to eligible operators to date. Section 45 of the Bill now provides the necessary legal underpinning for the scheme. Part 7 deals with the recognition of foreign driving licences held by people arriving in Ireland under the temporary protection directive. Visitors to Ireland can drive here on their national licences for up to a year. This is possible under the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic. Following recent case law, however, non-EU citizens granted temporary residence in Ireland may not drive here on their national licence and must obtain an Irish licence. Although a foreign licence can be recognised for exchange purposes in certain circumstances, there is currently no provision in the Road Traffic Acts to recognise a non-EU driving licence for use. Section 46 will introduce a new section 23B into the 1961 Road Traffic Act which will allow the Minister for Transport to respond immediately to large and sudden movements of people to Ireland under the temporary protection directive, following urgent humanitarian crises. This new provision will grant, by an order of the Minister, the immediate ability to drive in Ireland on a licence or permit issued by a non-EU state. The foreign licence will be recognised without the need to exchange it for an Irish licence and will be tied to the permission to reside granted under section 60 of the 2015 International Protection Act. Once the protection permission ceases or is revoked, the licence is no longer recognised. The definition of a driving licence in sections 38 and 40 of the 1961 Act will be expanded to require that a driving licence recognised under the new section 23B must be accompanied by a permission to reside. Section 47 amends sections 60 and 61 of the Road Traffic Act 2010. This amendment clarifies that if a driving licence recognised under the new section 23B is seized by a member of An Garda Síochána, only the driving licence is retained and not the permission to reside. While Parts 6 and 7 are not big, they deal with important issues. The haulage scheme provided the agile response and much-needed temporary assistance to the licensed haulage sector when it was facing sudden, sharp increases in fuel costs. Part 7 will provide the Minister for Transport with the necessary powers to react quickly in any future situations when people unfortunately need to come here under a temporary protection directive, by enabling them to use their national licence while in the State for the period of temporary protection. I hope the Bill will be progressed quickly.	spk_3

I will take this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. I understand that the Deputy's matter relates to the provision of bus services on routes operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, and whether any measures can or have been taken to improve these services. My Department has responsibility for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport. However, the Department is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services nationally, including those public service obligation, PSO, routes currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport services contracts, and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators. In the context of the Deputy's specific question regarding the PSO services currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, as the Deputy will be aware and as he alluded to, the Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound impact on the public transport sector due to the fall in passenger numbers, and the associated drop in fare revenues. To date, passenger numbers remain below pre-Covid levels and demand is currently at 80% of that experienced in 2019. This is expected to improve further in the coming months..	spk_76

The NTA and Go-Ahead Ireland are currently reviewing the existing service timetables and schedules to determine whether a modified timetable could be implemented over summer months when passenger demand is reduced, thereby reducing service disruption. It is hoped that a combination of these measures will help to significantly reduce the service provision issues that have occurred recently.

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-30	dail	33	Housing Provision	dbsect_17	Motor tax receipts in 2021 were €908 million. Motor tax receipts accrue to the Exchequer. Changes to motor tax rates, including the potential abolition of motor tax, require primary legislation. These changes are made at budget time and are given permanent effect as part of the finance Bill. A number of issues need to be considered in any proposal to abolish motor tax. The driver and computer services division of my Department is responsible for the maintenance of the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF, the central vehicle database, as well as supporting systems in local motor tax offices. The annual cost of running the NVDF is currently €22.9 million. However, the NVDF also supports road traffic enforcement, vehicle testing and the road transport operator licensing system and there would be a continuing requirement for it to remain in operation. Abolishing motor tax would require a legal framework to be put in place to ensure regular notification of vehicle and driver details to the NVDF, and compliance with that framework, to maintain an up-to-date vehicle database. Abolition of motor tax would result in savings on the paper cost of discs, and on printing and postage, as well as some savings on staff costs. However, it is estimated that would amount to total savings of just under €4 million in the Department. The Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government publishes the amalgamated audited annual financial statement for all the local authorities on an annual basis. The most recently published statement is for 2019 and gives the total cost of running the local authority motor tax service at €29.41 million for the year. Total savings, therefore, would be in the order of €33.5 million for the Department and local motor offices combined.  Motor tax rates are not a contributor to the recent increases in the cost of living. The last general increases in motor tax, affecting all vehicle categories, took effect from 1 January 2013. There were significant reductions in motor tax for goods vehicles in budget 2016, which took effect from 1 January 2016, with the top rate of tax being reduced from €5,195 to €900 annually. There were also some increases to rates from 1 January 2021 for some private vehicles based on carbon dioxide emissions and registered between 2008 and 2020. The rates applied only to the higher emitting bands C to G with rates increasing by between €10 and €50 annually. These changes applied to some 187,000 cars or approximately 8.5% of the total car fleet. Of those affected, 120,000 owners saw their annual tax increase by €10 with the upper increase of €50 applying to 7,000 vehicles. Motor tax is payable for three, six or 12 months. Any proposal to abolish motor tax would also need to consider the position of vehicles under current taxation at the time of abolition. It is likely that the owners of such vehicles would look for refunds of the proportion of motor tax paid for the time remaining on the disc. This would add significantly to the first-year cost of abolition as 2.9 million vehicles are under current taxation at any given time. Another aspect to be factored in are the provisions of the Eurovignette directive, which provides a legal framework for charging heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain roads. While the directive largely concentrates on the provision of mechanisms for infrastructure charging, it also sets minimum rates for vehicle taxes applied by member states to heavy goods vehicles. The minimum rate for the heaviest band is €929. Since the reduction in motor tax from January 2016 to a top rate of €900, Ireland has been in technical breach of the directive. Last but not least, motor tax is an important environmental policy lever. Motor tax based on CO2 emissions is on a graduated banding structure differentiating in favour of the most environmentally-friendly vehicles. Abolishing motor tax would reduce the incentive for owners to move to less polluting vehicles, potentially impacting the transport emissions target for 2030 set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021. In addition, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare may have considered this area as part of its deliberations on how the taxation system can be used to help Ireland move to a low-carbon economy. Any proposals to review or change motor tax should also be mindful of the commission's recommendations once published.	spk_80

I am advised that, due to the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases, Aer Lingus has been forced to cancel three return flights and one direct flight today. I am also advised that, due to a mandate from the London Heathrow Airport authority, one return flight to Dublin from Heathrow has also been cancelled today. Aer Lingus has apologised to those impacted and the team at the airline is working to accommodate impacted passengers on the next available service as efficiently as possible. According to Aer Lingus, it anticipated the return of demand for travel once Covid restrictions were removed and included buffers in its plans to deal with reasonable levels of disruption. As the Deputy will know, European Community Regulation No. 261/2004 sets out the rights of air passengers and the resulting obligations on airlines in the event of cancellations, denied boarding and flight delays. In Ireland, the Commission for Aviation Regulation is the designated national enforcement body. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I will be meeting with airlines with regard to what is happening at Dublin Airport and will raise these issues.	spk_141
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_19	I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Throughout the pandemic and more recently, the Government and the NTA have been actively engaged in ensuring appropriate and timely measures are in place to support the taxi sector in addressing the challenges it faces. I recognise that rising fuel costs are a significant challenge for all sectors. As the Deputy is aware, on 9 March the Government announced a temporary reduction in fuel-related excise duties of 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent per litre of diesel. These reductions, which were due to finish at the end of August, will be extended until budget day in October, at an additional cost of €80 million. This should help to reduce the operating costs of all private and commercial vehicle owners, including operators of non-electric small public service vehicles, SPSVs. In addition, the NTA's national maximum fares review, which closed for public consultation on 27 May, proposes an average increase of 12% in taxi fares from 31 August 2022. This will be the first increase in such fares since 2017. While the NTA has statutory responsibility for regulating the SPSV industry, taxi drivers are self-employed individuals and, as such, decide on their own business strategies within the regulatory framework, including choosing the times at which they operate. The NTA's 2022 driver survey shows that 93% of drivers are now working but only 29% currently undertake night work. Some 30% of drivers, up from 17% in 2019, reported that they would consider doing night work if the relevant fares were to increase. In recognition of this, the proposed fare increases have been weighted in favour of the premium rate that can be charged for journeys between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., as well as on Sundays and public holidays. The increase in cents and euro for each taxi user per journey is not substantial, but the cumulative impact is significant for drivers. The weighting in the increase has been designed to encourage more drivers to operate during these periods and also to encourage drivers who may still not have come back into the sector since the pandemic to reactivate their licences.	spk_300
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_19	On the ten-year rule, the NTA extended vehicle age limits several times during the pandemic, with standard age limits for taxis and hackneys now waived through to the end of 2022, thereby ensuring no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle. These extensions of vehicle age limits were emergency measures in recognition of the challenges faced during the pandemic, including the necessary health-related restrictions imposed on society and the resultant collapse in demand for SPSV services. This situation is now much changed and there has been a resurgence in demand for SPSV services with increased levels of social activity and particularly at night-time. This is where the premium rate will come into effect to encourage more taxi drivers to come on stream, especially at weekends, Sundays and public holidays.	spk_302
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_19	Of the 18,946 SPSV vehicles in the fleet in 2021, a total of 16,134 vehicles, which is equivalent to 85% of the fleet, were less than ten years old. A total of 2,359 vehicles were between ten and 15 years old, which represented 12.5% of the entire fleet. Approximately half of those, or 6.7%, were availing of the Covid-19 extension on the maximum permissible age. They were mainly taxis. The remaining 5.8% of vehicles were exempt from the ten-year age limit as a condition of their taxi licence or were older limousines. The number of vehicles older than 15 years was 444, which represents 2.3% of the total fleet. Of these, 150 vehicles, or 0.8%, were SPSVs availing of the NTA extension due to the impact of Covid-19. Most of the remainder were limousines.	spk_304

We can all agree that the passenger experience at Dublin Airport recently has fallen far short of the service that passengers should expect at our largest State airport. The DAA, as we all know, has the statutory responsibility to operate and manage Dublin Airport, including all the operations associated with security screening. The immediate priority is to ensure that Dublin Airport passengers can have confidence they will not miss their flights when they arrive on time at the airport. Following the unacceptable level of service experienced by passengers and the undue stress they endured, particularly on Sunday, 29 May, I re-established daily meetings with the CEO and senior management in the DAA. I conveyed to the representatives of the DAA my disappointment and frustration at the situation and emphasised the importance of the DAA setting out a detailed plan to address it and the urgent need to restore passenger confidence in Dublin Airport. The DAA outlined its plan and the operational changes to be made in advance of the bank holiday weekend. These included maximising the availability of staff resources, increasing the number of security lanes open at peak times and improving queue management. While last weekend and the bank holiday weekend were extremely busy, queues moved smoothly with no reports of flights being missed. I continue to engage with the DAA on its resourcing plan and the passenger experience at Dublin Airport. I am emphasising the importance of the airport management reassuring passengers that it is doing everything it can to deliver an acceptable passenger experience for all those departing from the airport. Though challenges remain, the DAA has advised that the measures it has taken will substantially mitigate risk into the busy summer period where passenger numbers are expected to increase by a further 10%. 	spk_306
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_19	I will raise those issues with the DAA, in particular special assistance. Workers' pay is an operational matter for the DAA. I met SIPTU representatives recently and conveyed my appreciation for passenger-facing staff, in particular, who are under huge pressure in the airport. They have been managing queues, clearing people through security, helping to board passengers and working in extremely difficult circumstances. The representatives raised with me the issue of staff who had done overtime and had not been paid. This matter was also raised with the DAA. It was a result of IT issues. There was a cyberattack. I am told by the DAA those issues are being resolved.	spk_308
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_19	We all want functioning State airports in Dublin and elsewhere. Part of the pressure is the understaffing in the airport and the shortage of labour, something which is hitting every sector. Since recruitment efforts were redoubled in March of this year, Dublin Airport has seen a significant interest in advertised positions. I understand it received more than 5,000 applications. At our weekly meetings we discuss staffing numbers, training and the deployment of new staff to help ease the pressure on current staff who are under extreme pressure in the airport. The operation of an airport is not a matter for the Minister; it is a matter for the DAA which has a statutory obligation in this regard. The Deputy can be ensured that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I are monitoring the situation. We want to continue to ensure that passengers have confidence that they can get to their flights on time, make their holidays, meet family and friends internationally and take the stress away from international travel.	spk_310
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_19	The overarching aim of the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan is to develop an accessible, integrated and sustainable network of public transport services in rural and regional areas nationwide. In budget 2022, I was delighted to secure an allocation of €5.6 million to progress, develop and begin delivery of this important plan. To keep this momentum going, I will be working closely with my colleagues in Government to secure funding for the continued rollout of Connecting Ireland over its five-year implementation period, which started earlier this year. Regarding the timeline, the delivery and improvement of routes identified through the consultation process on the Connecting Ireland plan are being prioritised to areas where Ukrainians fleeing the war in their homeland have been housed. Additional public transport services are being made available through an acceleration of network improvements, which include the provision of additional stops, route modifications and delivering more services with the aim of increasing connectivity. These services will ensure better access for all those housed in rural communities. Areas such as the Ring of Kerry will avail of such improvements, in practice catering for existing demands as well as responding to the increased pressures on services where the local population has grown in response to the humanitarian crisis.  I understand the services will be mainly provided by a mixture of Transport for Ireland Local Link and Bus Éireann services. Other examples of service accelerations already in place include those between the towns of Ennis and Ballyvaughan, Tullamore and Banagher, Ashbourne and Balbriggan and the Cavan-Monaghan area. I am advised that the NTA is currently in the procurement, planning and design stage for up to 40 enhanced services nationwide this year, with five aimed specifically at emergency transport provision. All going well, many of these services are anticipated to be operational by the end of the summer.  On the business case for Connecting Ireland, the final part of the Deputy's question, which includes provisional cost estimates, is currently under review in my Department. We are working hard to bring this ambitious plan to Government for its consideration as soon as possible.	spk_312
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_19	The business case for Connecting Ireland is still under scrutiny within the Department. It will then have to be sent to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its review. After that process, the business case then has to go to Government for approval due to the scale of the investment envisaged, which is very ambitious. It would be premature to discuss the possible cost of delivering Connecting Ireland until the business case is fully examined. Connecting Ireland proposes to expand the public transport network in rural areas. There will be a 25% overall increase in rural bus services and 70% of people in rural Ireland will have access to public transport services that provide at least three return trips daily to a nearby town. More than 100 rural villages will benefit from frequent public transport services for the first time. There will be more than 60 new connections to regional cities from surrounding areas and improved mobility options for those in remote areas with the provision of demand responsive and other innovative transport services.	spk_314

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_19	Before Covid-19, officials in my Department had commenced scoping work on a new national aviation policy. Unfortunately, that work has been on hold since 2020 for obvious reasons, that is, due to a focus on the detrimental impact of the pandemic. While we can now see the evidence that the recovery is under way, focus and resources have been diverted towards other objectives, including the terrible situation in Ukraine and the resultant restrictive measures that have been adopted in respect of the Russian Federation. My Department hopes to resume work on a new national aviation policy before the end of 2022. Despite the delay in this work, however, the current national aviation policy, published in August 2015, continues to guide aviation policy. The principal goals of the policy are to enhance Ireland's connectivity, to foster the growth of aviation enterprise and to maximise the contribution of aviation to Ireland's sustainable economic growth and development. Traditionally, Ireland has maintained a liberal aviation policy. That approach has served the country well. Before the pandemic, Ireland had air services to close to 200 destinations. While acknowledging that many of the objectives of the original national aviation policy remain valid, we also acknowledge that much has changed since 2015 in respect of the overall challenges for the aviation sector in Ireland, with a focus on continued recovery from the pandemic and a need to meet the decarbonisation goals necessary to achieve our climate ambitions. The programme for Government acknowledges the value of aviation in supporting economic development, international connectivity and tourism and commits to delivering the capital programmes required to support services and to ensure safety at our State and regional airports. That is achieved primarily through the two schemes administered by my Department, namely the regional airports capital expenditure grant scheme and a core airport management operational expenditure subvention scheme. Those supports, along with the Covid-specific aviation supports provided, have ensured that our airports are well positioned in stimulating their recovery from the effects of the pandemic. Recent statistics indicate that, in respect of regional airport performance, smaller airports are closer to their 2019 scheduled seat capacity levels.	spk_318
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_19	As for our current policy, the levers I have are through the regional airports programme. Under that programme, which runs from 2021 to 2025, €11.6 million in capital and operational supports was provided in 2021 alone to eligible airports, that is, Ireland West Airport Knock, Kerry Airport and Donegal Airport. There is also support for the public service obligation, PSO, services between Donegal and Dublin. In addition, the Government has provided funding for Shannon and Cork airports, as the Deputy will know, with more than €28 million in capital and operational supports in 2021 under the Covid-19 regional State airports programme. It is important to state also that there will be widespread consultation on our new aviation policy. The Deputy is a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. That committee will have a very important role to play in stakeholder engagement and as to what our new aviation policy will be like as we come out of the pandemic. The Deputy can be assured of my commitment to our regional airports, ensuring that they are supported and funded and that Ireland Inc. is connected from a regional point of view and an international point of view. This is a really good time, coming out of the pandemic, to look at our national aviation policy, and our regional connectivity will play a key part in that.	spk_320
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_19	To give an idea of the policy areas that were identified in the scoping exercise in 2020, the themes included: international context and connectivity; safety and security; infrastructure, operations and enterprise; and sustainability and climate. Aspects for consideration included defining optimal connectivity and looking at how to shape a future direction for both State and regional airports, looking specifically at how best they support the economic and social benefits of the regions they serve.It is also important to state as well that the operation of air services to, from and between airports remains a commercial decision for air carriers and our airports. That is something that I was very strong on even during the pandemic, when we did not have international travel but where I wanted to give funding directly to the airports so that they could negotiate directly with airlines in order to attract connectivity to the regions. It is important to say that these will be commercial decisions made by airlines. They will go to the airports which make viable and commercial sense for them also.	spk_322
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_20	I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Throughout the pandemic and more recently, the Government and the NTA have been actively engaged in ensuring appropriate and timely measures are in place to support the taxi sector in addressing the challenges it faces. I recognise that rising fuel costs are a significant challenge for all sectors. As the Deputy is aware, on 9 March the Government announced a temporary reduction in fuel-related excise duties of 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent per litre of diesel. These reductions, which were due to finish at the end of August, will be extended until budget day in October, at an additional cost of €80 million. This should help to reduce the operating costs of all private and commercial vehicle owners, including operators of non-electric small public service vehicles, SPSVs. In addition, the NTA's national maximum fares review, which closed for public consultation on 27 May, proposes an average increase of 12% in taxi fares from 31 August 2022. This will be the first increase in such fares since 2017. While the NTA has statutory responsibility for regulating the SPSV industry, taxi drivers are self-employed individuals and, as such, decide on their own business strategies within the regulatory framework, including choosing the times at which they operate. The NTA's 2022 driver survey shows that 93% of drivers are now working but only 29% currently undertake night work. Some 30% of drivers, up from 17% in 2019, reported that they would consider doing night work if the relevant fares were to increase. In recognition of this, the proposed fare increases have been weighted in favour of the premium rate that can be charged for journeys between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., as well as on Sundays and public holidays. The increase in cents and euro for each taxi user per journey is not substantial, but the cumulative impact is significant for drivers. The weighting in the increase has been designed to encourage more drivers to operate during these periods and also to encourage drivers who may still not have come back into the sector since the pandemic to reactivate their licences.	spk_300
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_20	On the ten-year rule, the NTA extended vehicle age limits several times during the pandemic, with standard age limits for taxis and hackneys now waived through to the end of 2022, thereby ensuring no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle. These extensions of vehicle age limits were emergency measures in recognition of the challenges faced during the pandemic, including the necessary health-related restrictions imposed on society and the resultant collapse in demand for SPSV services. This situation is now much changed and there has been a resurgence in demand for SPSV services with increased levels of social activity and particularly at night-time. This is where the premium rate will come into effect to encourage more taxi drivers to come on stream, especially at weekends, Sundays and public holidays.	spk_302
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_20	Of the 18,946 SPSV vehicles in the fleet in 2021, a total of 16,134 vehicles, which is equivalent to 85% of the fleet, were less than ten years old. A total of 2,359 vehicles were between ten and 15 years old, which represented 12.5% of the entire fleet. Approximately half of those, or 6.7%, were availing of the Covid-19 extension on the maximum permissible age. They were mainly taxis. The remaining 5.8% of vehicles were exempt from the ten-year age limit as a condition of their taxi licence or were older limousines. The number of vehicles older than 15 years was 444, which represents 2.3% of the total fleet. Of these, 150 vehicles, or 0.8%, were SPSVs availing of the NTA extension due to the impact of Covid-19. Most of the remainder were limousines.	spk_304

We can all agree that the passenger experience at Dublin Airport recently has fallen far short of the service that passengers should expect at our largest State airport. The DAA, as we all know, has the statutory responsibility to operate and manage Dublin Airport, including all the operations associated with security screening. The immediate priority is to ensure that Dublin Airport passengers can have confidence they will not miss their flights when they arrive on time at the airport. Following the unacceptable level of service experienced by passengers and the undue stress they endured, particularly on Sunday, 29 May, I re-established daily meetings with the CEO and senior management in the DAA. I conveyed to the representatives of the DAA my disappointment and frustration at the situation and emphasised the importance of the DAA setting out a detailed plan to address it and the urgent need to restore passenger confidence in Dublin Airport. The DAA outlined its plan and the operational changes to be made in advance of the bank holiday weekend. These included maximising the availability of staff resources, increasing the number of security lanes open at peak times and improving queue management. While last weekend and the bank holiday weekend were extremely busy, queues moved smoothly with no reports of flights being missed. I continue to engage with the DAA on its resourcing plan and the passenger experience at Dublin Airport. I am emphasising the importance of the airport management reassuring passengers that it is doing everything it can to deliver an acceptable passenger experience for all those departing from the airport. Though challenges remain, the DAA has advised that the measures it has taken will substantially mitigate risk into the busy summer period where passenger numbers are expected to increase by a further 10%. 	spk_306
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_21	I will raise those issues with the DAA, in particular special assistance. Workers' pay is an operational matter for the DAA. I met SIPTU representatives recently and conveyed my appreciation for passenger-facing staff, in particular, who are under huge pressure in the airport. They have been managing queues, clearing people through security, helping to board passengers and working in extremely difficult circumstances. The representatives raised with me the issue of staff who had done overtime and had not been paid. This matter was also raised with the DAA. It was a result of IT issues. There was a cyberattack. I am told by the DAA those issues are being resolved.	spk_308
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_21	We all want functioning State airports in Dublin and elsewhere. Part of the pressure is the understaffing in the airport and the shortage of labour, something which is hitting every sector. Since recruitment efforts were redoubled in March of this year, Dublin Airport has seen a significant interest in advertised positions. I understand it received more than 5,000 applications. At our weekly meetings we discuss staffing numbers, training and the deployment of new staff to help ease the pressure on current staff who are under extreme pressure in the airport. The operation of an airport is not a matter for the Minister; it is a matter for the DAA which has a statutory obligation in this regard. The Deputy can be ensured that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I are monitoring the situation. We want to continue to ensure that passengers have confidence that they can get to their flights on time, make their holidays, meet family and friends internationally and take the stress away from international travel.	spk_310
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_22	The overarching aim of the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan is to develop an accessible, integrated and sustainable network of public transport services in rural and regional areas nationwide. In budget 2022, I was delighted to secure an allocation of €5.6 million to progress, develop and begin delivery of this important plan. To keep this momentum going, I will be working closely with my colleagues in Government to secure funding for the continued rollout of Connecting Ireland over its five-year implementation period, which started earlier this year. Regarding the timeline, the delivery and improvement of routes identified through the consultation process on the Connecting Ireland plan are being prioritised to areas where Ukrainians fleeing the war in their homeland have been housed. Additional public transport services are being made available through an acceleration of network improvements, which include the provision of additional stops, route modifications and delivering more services with the aim of increasing connectivity. These services will ensure better access for all those housed in rural communities. Areas such as the Ring of Kerry will avail of such improvements, in practice catering for existing demands as well as responding to the increased pressures on services where the local population has grown in response to the humanitarian crisis.  I understand the services will be mainly provided by a mixture of Transport for Ireland Local Link and Bus Éireann services. Other examples of service accelerations already in place include those between the towns of Ennis and Ballyvaughan, Tullamore and Banagher, Ashbourne and Balbriggan and the Cavan-Monaghan area. I am advised that the NTA is currently in the procurement, planning and design stage for up to 40 enhanced services nationwide this year, with five aimed specifically at emergency transport provision. All going well, many of these services are anticipated to be operational by the end of the summer.  On the business case for Connecting Ireland, the final part of the Deputy's question, which includes provisional cost estimates, is currently under review in my Department. We are working hard to bring this ambitious plan to Government for its consideration as soon as possible.	spk_312
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_22	The business case for Connecting Ireland is still under scrutiny within the Department. It will then have to be sent to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its review. After that process, the business case then has to go to Government for approval due to the scale of the investment envisaged, which is very ambitious. It would be premature to discuss the possible cost of delivering Connecting Ireland until the business case is fully examined. Connecting Ireland proposes to expand the public transport network in rural areas. There will be a 25% overall increase in rural bus services and 70% of people in rural Ireland will have access to public transport services that provide at least three return trips daily to a nearby town. More than 100 rural villages will benefit from frequent public transport services for the first time. There will be more than 60 new connections to regional cities from surrounding areas and improved mobility options for those in remote areas with the provision of demand responsive and other innovative transport services.	spk_314

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_23	Before Covid-19, officials in my Department had commenced scoping work on a new national aviation policy. Unfortunately, that work has been on hold since 2020 for obvious reasons, that is, due to a focus on the detrimental impact of the pandemic. While we can now see the evidence that the recovery is under way, focus and resources have been diverted towards other objectives, including the terrible situation in Ukraine and the resultant restrictive measures that have been adopted in respect of the Russian Federation. My Department hopes to resume work on a new national aviation policy before the end of 2022. Despite the delay in this work, however, the current national aviation policy, published in August 2015, continues to guide aviation policy. The principal goals of the policy are to enhance Ireland's connectivity, to foster the growth of aviation enterprise and to maximise the contribution of aviation to Ireland's sustainable economic growth and development. Traditionally, Ireland has maintained a liberal aviation policy. That approach has served the country well. Before the pandemic, Ireland had air services to close to 200 destinations. While acknowledging that many of the objectives of the original national aviation policy remain valid, we also acknowledge that much has changed since 2015 in respect of the overall challenges for the aviation sector in Ireland, with a focus on continued recovery from the pandemic and a need to meet the decarbonisation goals necessary to achieve our climate ambitions. The programme for Government acknowledges the value of aviation in supporting economic development, international connectivity and tourism and commits to delivering the capital programmes required to support services and to ensure safety at our State and regional airports. That is achieved primarily through the two schemes administered by my Department, namely the regional airports capital expenditure grant scheme and a core airport management operational expenditure subvention scheme. Those supports, along with the Covid-specific aviation supports provided, have ensured that our airports are well positioned in stimulating their recovery from the effects of the pandemic. Recent statistics indicate that, in respect of regional airport performance, smaller airports are closer to their 2019 scheduled seat capacity levels.	spk_318
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_23	As for our current policy, the levers I have are through the regional airports programme. Under that programme, which runs from 2021 to 2025, €11.6 million in capital and operational supports was provided in 2021 alone to eligible airports, that is, Ireland West Airport Knock, Kerry Airport and Donegal Airport. There is also support for the public service obligation, PSO, services between Donegal and Dublin. In addition, the Government has provided funding for Shannon and Cork airports, as the Deputy will know, with more than €28 million in capital and operational supports in 2021 under the Covid-19 regional State airports programme. It is important to state also that there will be widespread consultation on our new aviation policy. The Deputy is a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. That committee will have a very important role to play in stakeholder engagement and as to what our new aviation policy will be like as we come out of the pandemic.

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I thank the Deputy and am taking these questions on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan. We are acutely aware of the increase in the cost of living in recent months and the Minister recognises the impact that this has had on households across the country. For this reason, he was pleased to be able to introduce a 20% average fare reduction on public service obligation, PSO, public transport services until the end of this year. This initiative is benefiting the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use public transport every day. The Minister is delighted to report that passenger numbers are slowly returning to pre-Covid-19 figures. Last week, on average, PSO services carried about 84% of the numbers they carried before the pandemic. In fact, certain markets are reporting passenger levels well above 2019 levels, particularly on some of our Local Link, town and regional city services. All of these individuals are now benefiting from lower fare costs. The 20% fare reduction comes on top of several other measures that we are progressing to encourage greater public transport patronage. For instance, there is the young adult Leap card, which provides an average 50% fare discount for those aged between 19 and 23 on both PSO and commercial services. There is also the Transport for Ireland, TFI, 90-minute fares scheme which means that adults now pay €2, young adults pay €1, and children pay just 65 cent to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin. In May alone, the number of people who had a child Leap card, a student Leap card, or the new young adult Leap card increased by over 16,000, which is very encouraging. While fare reductions are to be welcomed, the investment in additional services is also critical. For this reason, the Minister is committed to progressing core projects like BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and DART+, as well as improving existing services across the country. That being said, public transport fare initiatives have a role to play in combatting the rising cost of transport and in encouraging modal shift. As such, the Minister would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023. He is acutely aware, however, of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources. The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so the Minister will work closely with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and other Government colleagues, in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services.	spk_328
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	The decisions on this will be through the 2023 Estimates process, when we will be discussing this issue with our Government colleagues. It has only been a number of weeks since the 20% fare reductions have come into place on the young adult Leap card. The National Transport Authority, NTA, will be carrying out detailed research to determine the impact of fare reductions at that stage when the schemes have been in place for a reasonable amount of time. That will give us far more information. The fact that there has been significant uptake in public transport usage is a very positive indicator at this point in time. That NTA research will also inform our decisions on this matter.	spk_330
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	On the question of people's working patterns now and hybrid working, I will furnish some further information. As I said, overall PSO passenger numbers are approximately 84% of pre-Covid-19 levels. Passengers are returning in good numbers in most markets with Local Link and Bus Éireann's town services in Limerick and Galway all reporting levels at or similar to 2019 levels. Increasingly, it appears that the primary cause of reduced total passengers is office-based workers travelling less. This is consistent when considering that pre-Covid-19 analysis showed white-collar worker commuters to be 30% to 35% of total demand. A 50% reduction in these trips would account for 15% to 17.5% of overall demand. This supported the anecdotal evidence that many office workers are working a hybrid model of two or three days per week at home. Fare reductions are to be welcomed but investment in additional services is also valuable for customers and communities. We need to ensure that we maintain the right balance between those factors.	spk_332
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I agree. We want to encourage people to use public transport. That is the aim with the 20% price reduction and the young adult card. I will relay his point on those issues to the Minister. No matter where you draw the line there will be someone outside it but I hear exactly what he is saying. We want to get people out of their cars and incentivise them to use public transport where they can and make it more affordable for them to do that.	spk_334
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I am taking this question for the Minister so I will raise that with him and ask him to respond to the Deputy directly.	spk_336
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I understand that the National Transport Authority expects to engage support services later this year to undertake the review of the Galway transport strategy and commence the review process at the end of the year. The review will be led by the NTA in co-operation with Galway City Council and Galway County Council. The review process will include consideration of all potential transport modes including light rail. As part of the strategy review work, assessment work will be undertaken in relation to light rail. As I have noted previously, this approach will allow for a multi-modal perspective and integration within an overall land-use plan. The NTA expects to publish a draft updated transport strategy for Galway for public consultation in quarter 3 of next year. I agree with the Deputy on the need to increase sustainable mobility options in Galway and to consider the merits of light rail as part of those options. We need to shape the city around public transport rather than roads. The review of the Galway transport strategy will look at population projections, development density, employment forecasts and travel demand patterns. This analysis will be used to reassess the public transport needs across the city and the potential role all modes of transport, including light rail, can play in meeting those needs. In the meantime, implementation will continue on the current Galway transport strategy. This includes the Galway BusConnects programme with key elements like the Salmon Weir Bridge, the cross-city link and the Dublin Road corridor advancing. Further projects include the roll-out of improved active travel infrastructure, redevelopment of Ceannt Station and the improvements planned for Oranmore station and rail track infrastructure.	spk_338
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I must say I agree about park and ride and the urgency of identifying sites if we want to encourage people out of their cars to use public transport. I understand that the NTA is developing its park and ride strategy for Galway and will present it to Galway City Council and County Council in July. As I am sure the Deputy will know, a feasibility study for light rail in Galway will be carried out as part of the review of the strategy and will be considered in the overall framework of the strategy. That will allow for a multi-modal perspective and integration within an overall land use plan. 	spk_340

There has been the cross-city corridor, the Salmon Weir Bridge and there is some movement with BusConnects but it needs to continue and move faster. I understand the NTA will present the strategy on park and ride sites to both councils in July and that the feasibility study for light rail will be done as part of the overall framework for the Galway transport strategy. That will ensure that it looks at a multi-modal perspective and integrated approach that includes an overall land-use plan.	spk_342
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 86 together. I am responding on behalf of the Minister. As the Deputy may be aware, the BusConnects Dublin preliminary business case was approved by the Government on 8 March of this year, on the Minister's recommendation.Approval of this business case allows the 16 core bus corridors to enter the planning process. The NTA will submit the 16 corridors as 12 applications to An Bord Pleanála. The first of these, from Clongriffin to the city centre, was submitted in April and the second, from Belfield or Blackrock to the city centre, was submitted in early May. Two further applications, the Blanchardstown to city centre scheme and the Liffey Valley to city centre scheme, will be made in June, with the remainder to follow during the second half of 2022. In parallel, a construction strategy is being developed for all corridors which will include the commencement of the procurement of contractors. The timing of the construction contract award and commencement will be determined by the decision timeline of An Bord Pleanála with regard to the planning consent applications. If the compulsory purchase order, CPO, is confirmed by An Bord Pleanála and subject to any legal challenges by way of judicial review, a document called a notice to treat will be served on each landowner whose land is being acquired. Following service of the notice to treat, the landowner will be required to submit a claim for compensation, at which stage the NTA will engage with all landowners with regard to their specific requirements. The NTA is available to discuss the CPO process with any resident who may have specific queries or concerns. As with all schemes where roads and streets are being upgraded, there will be some temporary disruption and alterations to on-street and off-street parking provision and access to premises in certain locations along the proposed scheme. Local arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis to maintain continued access to homes and businesses affected by the works, where practicable. Details regarding temporary access provisions will be discussed with homes and businesses prior to construction starting in the area.	spk_344

The BusConnects network redesign for the entire bus network in Dublin, as overseen by the NTA, is being rolled out in 11 phases. It began in 2021 with the launch of the first two phases: the H spine from Howth or Malahide to the city centre in June, and the C spine in November. Phase 3, which was launched in May of this year, consists of two northern orbital routes: the N4 from Blanchardstown to Point Village and the N6 from Finglas to Howth Junction. A further two phases will be introduced later this year and all 11 phases are due for completion by 2025. I will raise the issues highlighted by the Deputies with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I will have him come back to them on the matter.	spk_347

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	The young adult card was launched on PSO services on 9 May, with more than 1,000 applications received by the NTA on the launch day alone. We are currently working on broadening the initiative to include commercial bus services, with the aim to have that in place before the return of third level colleges. This will mean that, nationwide, those aged between 19 and 23 will be able to avail of an average 50% discount in their public transport fares. The initiative, as the Deputy will know, is aimed at supporting our young people to establish strong and sustainable mobility habits. Setting public transport fares at appropriate levels is key to achieving this objective. I am pleased to say that since April, when a further 20% reduction in PSO fares was introduced, all passengers under the age of 24 in possession of a Leap card now travel on PSO services at significantly reduced rates. Under the TFI 90-minute fares scheme, a young adult aged between 19 and 23 pays just €1 to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin, while a child pays just 65 cent for the same trip. Child fares are available to everyone under 16 and to those aged between 16 and 18 when paying with a personalised Leap card. For those paying with cash, the child fare is only applicable to under-16s. As such, I strongly recommend that those in the 16- to 18-year age bracket apply for their personalised Leap cards which can be done easily on  In response to the Deputy's question regarding the uptake of the young adult card, it is important to stress that the initiative has only been up and running for a matter of weeks. After a reasonable period of time, the NTA will carry out detailed research to determine its full impact. I will report that in May alone, the number of people who had a child Leap card, student Leap card or the new young adult Leap card increased by more than 16,000, which is extremely encouraging. 	spk_351
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I thank Deputies for their comments on this. It is clear that we need to look at ways to encourage more people to use public transport. That is an aim and objective of Government. We will look at the NTA's research on it. We can all see the positives anecdotally before even seeing that research. This will be broadened to include commercial operators as quickly as possible. The NTA is currently assessing the deployment options. A working group has been established to expedite the roll-out of this scheme to commercial bus operators.	spk_355

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 91 together. My Department is currently focused on delivering a number of existing measures in our climate action plan, sustainable mobility policy and road safety strategy, none of which propose the introduction of a curb on new vehicle sales on the basis of a vehicle's size. However, our existing approach to the taxation of motor vehicles through vehicle registration tax, VRT, is already designed to encourage a shift to improved emissions performance and my Department continues to engage with the Department of Finance on further possible improvements. I note that budget 2021 introduced a revised charging structure for VRT bands based on the new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure, WLTP, emissions test to better reflect real driving data, which follows the introduction of a nitrogen oxide surcharge in budget 2020. I am also aware of recent studies which reflect the fact that while the standards imposed on vehicle manufacturers have led to an overall reduction in tailpipe emissions in new vehicles, an increasing trend towards the purchase of larger vehicle models can bring significant environmental and air quality risks with the increased shedding of toxic particulate matter through increased tyre wear. This is a risk which may also apply to heavier electric vehicle models. Given the increased risk to vulnerable and other road users involved in collisions with heavier vehicles, I believe we need to take a wider holistic approach and shift to more sustainable transport modes and reduce our level of private car use more generally, which will improve overall well-being and make our urban centres more attractive places to live. My Department’s recently published sustainable mobility policy and Five Cities Demand Management Study sets out the vision and actions we will take. I recently established a leadership group and delivery team to oversee and drive implementation of the sustainable mobility policy and delivery of its action plan over the next three years.	spk_359
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I thank the Deputies. It is clear from their contributions that we need to take a wider holistic approach to this. We are doing an awful lot in respect of public transport and active travel. There was a question today, for which the Deputy was not present, about electric vehicle charging points and the roll-out of charging infrastructure. It is very clear that a large part of reducing emissions here will be the roll-out of electric vehicles particularly for people in rural Ireland who may not always have access to public transport. On the VRT charge on cars, it is calculated using carbon dioxide emissions. The higher the car's emissions, the more VRT is payable. It is also important to acknowledge new research indicating that almost 2,000 times more particle pollution is produced by tire wear than is pumped out of exhausts of modern cars. This is new research that we all need to take on board. The Fit for 55 package of measures includes a proposal to revise the carbon dioxide emissions standards for cars and light goods vehicles as currently set out in EU regulation 2019/631. The Commission has proposed an outright ban from 2035 on the sale of new ICE cars and vans coupled with a strengthening of emissions reductions targets for vehicle manufacturers ahead of that date. A number of measures are coming in at EU level as well, further reducing carbon dioxide emissions and stimulating a wider deployment of zero emissions vehicles by triggering manufacturers to increase the supply of zero emissions vehicles.	spk_363

There are currently more than 58,000 EVs registered on Irish roads. That is since the end of April 2022. By 2030, the abatement impact for an additional 845,000 passenger EVs is estimated to be about 2.5 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This figure is informed by the Department of Transport's modelling of the projected car fleet profile for the climate action plan 2021. It is important to say that it is a combination of measures, a multi-modal transport system, including public transport, active travel and electric vehicles. Road safety is obviously critical to that. We have a very ambitious road safety plan. All of those measures are going to be important to have a sustainable transport network. It is not just one form of transport that will see us meeting our climate emissions reductions.	spk_365
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 76 and 89 together. The DAA introduced a voluntary severance scheme, VSS, during the summer of 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 crisis as part of the cost-cutting measures deemed necessary to secure the continued viability of the company. This was at a time when the DAA was losing €1 million per day, passenger traffic was substantially reduced, and there was uncertainty around the timing of a recovery with 2019 levels of passengers not envisaged until 2024 or 2025. The DAA took a number of measures to address its cost base of which payroll was its largest cost. At the time all staff were working a four day week and salaries were reduced to 80% from normal levels, giving rise to significant savings. However, even with these temporary measures in place and given the dramatic fall in passenger numbers, the DAA advised that it needed to urgently reduce staff numbers to align with the reduced volume of business. The DAA was seeking to avoid the need for compulsory redundancies, wholesale lay-offs and permanent reductions to pay which it was ultimately successful in achieving. Given the extremely serious situation that the DAA was in, at the height of the pandemic in 2020, the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform approved the terms and conditions of the VSS proposed by the DAA as required under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. The VSS was closed to new applicants in December 2020 and the DAA did not start any significant external recruitment until quarter 3 of 2021 as public health restrictions on travel began to be partially lifted.	spk_367
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I thank the Deputies. As I said in response to a previous question, what happened on 31 May at Dublin Airport was completely unacceptable and fell well below the standards expected. We have engaged in our weekly meetings on this. The DAA has put in place a plan and presented it to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. It is critical that the DAA, which has statutory responsibility to operate and manage Dublin Airport, including in respect of required staffing levels, security staffing and the screening of staff who are needed, does what is required of it. On the VSS, the terms and conditions are agreed by the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. That is required under the code of practice. However, regarding the number of staff targeted under the scheme, staffing levels are a matter for the DAA. Ministers or Governments do not run airports; that is the statutory responsibility of the DAA. That is what I have said at my meetings. When I met the chair of the DAA, I was very clear that the authority needs to restore the confidence of the travelling public to ensure everyone who turns up at the airport gets their flight on time. That is the role of the authority. I continue to be clear about that.	spk_372
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I was very clear on the role of the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The terms and conditions of the VSS were approved by both Ministers. On staffing levels, the take-up under the VSS is completely a matter for the DAA. It runs the airport. It is looking at projections for passenger numbers. It is predicted that the return to the levels of 2019 will be in 2024 or 2025, but that is a matter for the DAA. It runs the airport, not the Department and certainly not Ministers. In fact, it would not be appropriate for a Minister to intervene in the operations of a commercial State body. That is the DAA's function. To put the matter in context, the CEO said at the meeting of the joint committee that if he knew at the time what he knew now, he would not have made the decisions, but they certainly involved operational and management matters for the DAA. The Minister for Transport and I engage weekly with the DAA on the roll-out of the plan. Since October 2021, 346 of the 370 additional security staff identified as required have been recruited, and the DAA expects to fill the remainder of the roles by the end of June. These figures were provided to me by the DAA. Of the 346 staff in place, 96 are still in training and these will be incrementally deployed as they complete their training and are certified. I have been told that once the 370 staff are deployed, which is to be by mid-July, the DAA's security staff level will be the equivalent of that of 2019. Again, these are operational issues for the DAA. Ensuring that passengers travelling through the airport make their flights on time is its role and responsibility. I have been categoric with the chair and management on that.	spk_374
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	I agree with the Deputy on ensuring we have a functioning airport.It is not just about people getting their flights, although that is an absolute because it is the key service, it is also about staffing. It is about ensuring that the infrastructure is in good repair. It is about a whole range of issues that the DAA is well equipped to deal with, given that it knows both its role and function. I am ensuring that, through these meetings, this continues to happen. I absolutely agree with the Deputy that the DAA fell way below the standards. What happened is unacceptable, particularly on the weekend of 31 May, and we need to ensure it does not reoccur. That is my point. We are all on the same page. The DAA is on the same page with regard to ensuring that we have a successful airport that is safe for everybody, namely, those who work there and those who pass through it.	spk_377
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_24	In the context of the 370 staff, the DAA has told me that they should be deployed by mid-July and that, at that point, it should have security staffing levels equivalent to 2019. Again, I want to reassure Deputies of my engagement and that of the Minister with the management and with the chair of the DAA in this regard. It is about increasing security staffing in particular at the airport in order to relieve pressure. There are contingency plans in place through the triaging that the DAA feels will be adequate in ensuring passengers will be able to make their flights on time. We will continue to monitor this.	spk_381
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_25	I thank the Deputy and am taking these questions on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan. We are acutely aware of the increase in the cost of living in recent months and the Minister recognises the impact that this has had on households across the country. For this reason, he was pleased to be able to introduce a 20% average fare reduction on public service obligation, PSO, public transport services until the end of this year. This initiative is benefiting the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use public transport every day. The Minister is delighted to report that passenger numbers are slowly returning to pre-Covid-19 figures. Last week, on average, PSO services carried about 84% of the numbers they carried before the pandemic. In fact, certain markets are reporting passenger levels well above 2019 levels, particularly on some of our Local Link, town and regional city services. All of these individuals are now benefiting from lower fare costs. The 20% fare reduction comes on top of several other measures that we are progressing to encourage greater public transport patronage. For instance, there is the young adult Leap card, which provides an average 50% fare discount for those aged between 19 and 23 on both PSO and commercial services. There is also the Transport for Ireland, TFI, 90-minute fares scheme which means that adults now pay €2, young adults pay €1, and children pay just 65 cent to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin. In May alone, the number of people who had a child Leap card, a student Leap card, or the new young adult Leap card increased by over 16,000, which is very encouraging. While fare reductions are to be welcomed, the investment in additional services is also critical. For this reason, the Minister is committed to progressing core projects like BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and DART+, as well as improving existing services across the country. That being said, public transport fare initiatives have a role to play in combatting the rising cost of transport and in encouraging modal shift. As such, the Minister would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023. He is acutely aware, however, of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources. The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so the Minister will work closely with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and other Government colleagues, in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services.	spk_328
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_25	The decisions on this will be through the 2023 Estimates process, when we will be discussing this issue with our Government colleagues. It has only been a number of weeks since the 20% fare reductions have come into place on the young adult Leap card. The National Transport Authority, NTA, will be carrying out detailed research to determine the impact of fare reductions at that stage when the schemes have been in place for a reasonable amount of time. That will give us far more information. The fact that there has been significant uptake in public transport usage is a very positive indicator at this point in time. That NTA research will also inform our decisions on this matter.	spk_330
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_25	On the question of people's working patterns now and hybrid working, I will furnish some further information. As I said, overall PSO passenger numbers are approximately 84% of pre-Covid-19 levels. Passengers are returning in good numbers in most markets with Local Link and Bus Éireann's town services in Limerick and Galway all reporting levels at or similar to 2019 levels. Increasingly, it appears that the primary cause of reduced total passengers is office-based workers travelling less. This is consistent when considering that pre-Covid-19 analysis showed white-collar worker commuters to be 30% to 35% of total demand. A 50% reduction in these trips would account for 15% to 17.5% of overall demand. This supported the anecdotal evidence that many office workers are working a hybrid model of two or three days per week at home. Fare reductions are to be welcomed but investment in additional services is also valuable for customers and communities. We need to ensure that we maintain the right balance between those factors.	spk_332
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_25	I agree. We want to encourage people to use public transport. That is the aim with the 20% price reduction and the young adult card. I will relay his point on those issues to the Minister. No matter where you draw the line there will be someone outside it but I hear exactly what he is saying. We want to get people out of their cars and incentivise them to use public transport where they can and make it more affordable for them to do that.	spk_334

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_26	I understand that the National Transport Authority expects to engage support services later this year to undertake the review of the Galway transport strategy and commence the review process at the end of the year. The review will be led by the NTA in co-operation with Galway City Council and Galway County Council. The review process will include consideration of all potential transport modes including light rail. As part of the strategy review work, assessment work will be undertaken in relation to light rail. As I have noted previously, this approach will allow for a multi-modal perspective and integration within an overall land-use plan. The NTA expects to publish a draft updated transport strategy for Galway for public consultation in quarter 3 of next year. I agree with the Deputy on the need to increase sustainable mobility options in Galway and to consider the merits of light rail as part of those options. We need to shape the city around public transport rather than roads. The review of the Galway transport strategy will look at population projections, development density, employment forecasts and travel demand patterns. This analysis will be used to reassess the public transport needs across the city and the potential role all modes of transport, including light rail, can play in meeting those needs. In the meantime, implementation will continue on the current Galway transport strategy. This includes the Galway BusConnects programme with key elements like the Salmon Weir Bridge, the cross-city link and the Dublin Road corridor advancing. Further projects include the roll-out of improved active travel infrastructure, redevelopment of Ceannt Station and the improvements planned for Oranmore station and rail track infrastructure.	spk_338
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_26	I must say I agree about park and ride and the urgency of identifying sites if we want to encourage people out of their cars to use public transport. I understand that the NTA is developing its park and ride strategy for Galway and will present it to Galway City Council and County Council in July. As I am sure the Deputy will know, a feasibility study for light rail in Galway will be carried out as part of the review of the strategy and will be considered in the overall framework of the strategy. That will allow for a multi-modal perspective and integration within an overall land use plan. 	spk_340

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Bus Services	dbsect_27	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 86 together. I am responding on behalf of the Minister. As the Deputy may be aware, the BusConnects Dublin preliminary business case was approved by the Government on 8 March of this year, on the Minister's recommendation.Approval of this business case allows the 16 core bus corridors to enter the planning process. The NTA will submit the 16 corridors as 12 applications to An Bord Pleanála. The first of these, from Clongriffin to the city centre, was submitted in April and the second, from Belfield or Blackrock to the city centre, was submitted in early May. Two further applications, the Blanchardstown to city centre scheme and the Liffey Valley to city centre scheme, will be made in June, with the remainder to follow during the second half of 2022. In parallel, a construction strategy is being developed for all corridors which will include the commencement of the procurement of contractors. The timing of the construction contract award and commencement will be determined by the decision timeline of An Bord Pleanála with regard to the planning consent applications. If the compulsory purchase order, CPO, is confirmed by An Bord Pleanála and subject to any legal challenges by way of judicial review, a document called a notice to treat will be served on each landowner whose land is being acquired. Following service of the notice to treat, the landowner will be required to submit a claim for compensation, at which stage the NTA will engage with all landowners with regard to their specific requirements. The NTA is available to discuss the CPO process with any resident who may have specific queries or concerns. As with all schemes where roads and streets are being upgraded, there will be some temporary disruption and alterations to on-street and off-street parking provision and access to premises in certain locations along the proposed scheme. Local arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis to maintain continued access to homes and businesses affected by the works, where practicable. Details regarding temporary access provisions will be discussed with homes and businesses prior to construction starting in the area.	spk_344

The BusConnects network redesign for the entire bus network in Dublin, as overseen by the NTA, is being rolled out in 11 phases. It began in 2021 with the launch of the first two phases: the H spine from Howth or Malahide to the city centre in June, and the C spine in November. Phase 3, which was launched in May of this year, consists of two northern orbital routes: the N4 from Blanchardstown to Point Village and the N6 from Finglas to Howth Junction. A further two phases will be introduced later this year and all 11 phases are due for completion by 2025. I will raise the issues highlighted by the Deputies with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I will have him come back to them on the matter.	spk_347

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Transport Costs	dbsect_28	The young adult card was launched on PSO services on 9 May, with more than 1,000 applications received by the NTA on the launch day alone. We are currently working on broadening the initiative to include commercial bus services, with the aim to have that in place before the return of third level colleges. This will mean that, nationwide, those aged between 19 and 23 will be able to avail of an average 50% discount in their public transport fares. The initiative, as the Deputy will know, is aimed at supporting our young people to establish strong and sustainable mobility habits. Setting public transport fares at appropriate levels is key to achieving this objective. I am pleased to say that since April, when a further 20% reduction in PSO fares was introduced, all passengers under the age of 24 in possession of a Leap card now travel on PSO services at significantly reduced rates. Under the TFI 90-minute fares scheme, a young adult aged between 19 and 23 pays just €1 to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin, while a child pays just 65 cent for the same trip. Child fares are available to everyone under 16 and to those aged between 16 and 18 when paying with a personalised Leap card. For those paying with cash, the child fare is only applicable to under-16s. As such, I strongly recommend that those in the 16- to 18-year age bracket apply for their personalised Leap cards which can be done easily on  In response to the Deputy's question regarding the uptake of the young adult card, it is important to stress that the initiative has only been up and running for a matter of weeks. After a reasonable period of time, the NTA will carry out detailed research to determine its full impact. I will report that in May alone, the number of people who had a child Leap card, student Leap card or the new young adult Leap card increased by more than 16,000, which is extremely encouraging. 	spk_351

However, even with these temporary measures in place and given the dramatic fall in passenger numbers, the DAA advised that it needed to urgently reduce staff numbers to align with the reduced volume of business. The DAA was seeking to avoid the need for compulsory redundancies, wholesale lay-offs and permanent reductions to pay which it was ultimately successful in achieving. Given the extremely serious situation that the DAA was in, at the height of the pandemic in 2020, the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform approved the terms and conditions of the VSS proposed by the DAA as required under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. The VSS was closed to new applicants in December 2020 and the DAA did not start any significant external recruitment until quarter 3 of 2021 as public health restrictions on travel began to be partially lifted.	spk_367
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_30	I thank the Deputies. As I said in response to a previous question, what happened on 31 May at Dublin Airport was completely unacceptable and fell well below the standards expected. We have engaged in our weekly meetings on this. The DAA has put in place a plan and presented it to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. It is critical that the DAA, which has statutory responsibility to operate and manage Dublin Airport, including in respect of required staffing levels, security staffing and the screening of staff who are needed, does what is required of it. On the VSS, the terms and conditions are agreed by the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. That is required under the code of practice. However, regarding the number of staff targeted under the scheme, staffing levels are a matter for the DAA. Ministers or Governments do not run airports; that is the statutory responsibility of the DAA. That is what I have said at my meetings. When I met the chair of the DAA, I was very clear that the authority needs to restore the confidence of the travelling public to ensure everyone who turns up at the airport gets their flight on time. That is the role of the authority. I continue to be clear about that.	spk_372
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_30	I was very clear on the role of the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The terms and conditions of the VSS were approved by both Ministers. On staffing levels, the take-up under the VSS is completely a matter for the DAA. It runs the airport. It is looking at projections for passenger numbers. It is predicted that the return to the levels of 2019 will be in 2024 or 2025, but that is a matter for the DAA. It runs the airport, not the Department and certainly not Ministers. In fact, it would not be appropriate for a Minister to intervene in the operations of a commercial State body. That is the DAA's function. To put the matter in context, the CEO said at the meeting of the joint committee that if he knew at the time what he knew now, he would not have made the decisions, but they certainly involved operational and management matters for the DAA. The Minister for Transport and I engage weekly with the DAA on the roll-out of the plan. Since October 2021, 346 of the 370 additional security staff identified as required have been recruited, and the DAA expects to fill the remainder of the roles by the end of June. These figures were provided to me by the DAA. Of the 346 staff in place, 96 are still in training and these will be incrementally deployed as they complete their training and are certified. I have been told that once the 370 staff are deployed, which is to be by mid-July, the DAA's security staff level will be the equivalent of that of 2019. Again, these are operational issues for the DAA. Ensuring that passengers travelling through the airport make their flights on time is its role and responsibility. I have been categoric with the chair and management on that.	spk_374
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_30	I agree with the Deputy on ensuring we have a functioning airport.It is not just about people getting their flights, although that is an absolute because it is the key service, it is also about staffing. It is about ensuring that the infrastructure is in good repair. It is about a whole range of issues that the DAA is well equipped to deal with, given that it knows both its role and function. I am ensuring that, through these meetings, this continues to happen. I absolutely agree with the Deputy that the DAA fell way below the standards. What happened is unacceptable, particularly on the weekend of 31 May, and we need to ensure it does not reoccur. That is my point. We are all on the same page. The DAA is on the same page with regard to ensuring that we have a successful airport that is safe for everybody, namely, those who work there and those who pass through it.	spk_377
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-14	dail	33	Dublin Airport Authority	dbsect_30	In the context of the 370 staff, the DAA has told me that they should be deployed by mid-July and that, at that point, it should have security staffing levels equivalent to 2019. Again, I want to reassure Deputies of my engagement and that of the Minister with the management and with the chair of the DAA in this regard. It is about increasing security staffing in particular at the airport in order to relieve pressure. There are contingency plans in place through the triaging that the DAA feels will be adequate in ensuring passengers will be able to make their flights on time. We will continue to monitor this.	spk_381
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-06-01	dail	33	Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	I thank the Deputies for tabling this motion and for their valuable contributions. As set out in the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, the Government believes the State has a fundamental role in enabling older people and people with disabilities to remain living independently in their own homes. The opportunity to discuss and debate this very important issue this morning is welcome. While the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has some concerns about some elements of the motion, for example, to ensure grants are linked to the cost of the specific works as a percentage of the costs, given the uncontrolled nature of the financial commitment, the Government is not opposing the motion as its aim is to support properly and rightly the housing adaptation grants for older people and people with disability. Therefore, I will provide an update to the Dáil on progress to date as well as plans to address the issues raised. The suite of housing adaptation grants for older people and people with disability are for private home owners and are 80% funded by the Exchequer with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authorities. There are three distinct grant types being delivered through local authorities: the housing adaptation grant for people with a disability scheme provides grants of up to €30,000 to assist people with a disability to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out to their homes; the housing aids for older people scheme provides grants of up to €8,000 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have the necessary repairs or improvements carried out; the mobility aids grant scheme is available to fast-track grants of up €6,000 to cover a basic suite of works to address the mobility problems of a member of a household. Demand for these grants has been consistently high since they were introduced in 2007. There is a programme for Government commitment to increase funding and make the grants more accessible. In 2021 there were 10,283 grants delivered at a total cost of almost €71 million. More than €81 million is allocated for the grants in 2022. These figures include the 20% local authority contribution. Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland was launched in September 2021 and established a number of targets to increase the supply of private, social and affordable homes and increase overall affordability. In total 300,000 new homes are targeted by 2030 of which 90,000 will be social homes, 54,000 will be affordable purchase or cost rental and the remaining 166,000 or so will be private market housing. The plan promotes compact, sustainable urban growth and will be supported by funding of €4 billion per year. In particular the housing needs of older people are addressed in the plan, the objective of which is to ensure that older people will be afforded increased housing options to allow them to remain living in their own homes for as long as possible, or to access age-friendly housing. Furthermore it commits to ensuring that affordable, quality housing with an appropriate mix of housing design types provided within social housing, including universally designed units is available to everyone in Irish society including those with disabilities and older people.  Housing for All commits to increasing the housing options available to older people to facilitate ageing in place with dignity and independence, delivering an appropriate range of housing and related supports services in an integrated sustainable manner which will promote equality of opportunity, individual choice and independent living for people with a disability. In January 2022, as signalled in the Housing for All, the National Housing Strategy for Disabled People 2022-2027 was launched. The new strategy sets out a vision for the co-operation and collaboration of Departments, State agencies and others in delivering housing and the related supports for disabled people over the next five years. This new strategy will operate within the framework of Housing for All and places a greater emphasis on independent living and community inclusion. Implementation of the plan will be based on the principles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Housing for All policy objective to make more efficient use of existing housing stock includes the development of a national policy on right-sizing and to explore options to support and incentivise right-sizing on a voluntary basis. Work is under way through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to inform and progress the development of national policy on right-sizing this year. There has also been increasing support for the adaptation of local authority homes with funding increasing year on year to help meet the needs of local authority tenants. Funding under the disabled persons grant scheme has increased from a level of more than €15 million in 2019 to almost €24 million in 2021 for which local authorities were approved funding for all works that they advised would be completed that year. This gave local authorities an opportunity to clear backlogs and carry out more costly works such as extensions. For 2022 allocations have been in excess of €23 million which is considered sufficient to meet the demands of all local authorities with a further contingency available to address any shortfall in commitments already in place or urgent cases which may arise. In regard to the retrofitting scheme the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has in 2022 a total of €267 million allocated for the SEAI residential and community schemes this year. This is the highest ever allocation for the schemes. The investment will support almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including more than 8,600 home upgrades to a building energy rating, BER, of B2 which is a near doubling of B2 output over 2021. Since the launch of the new supports in February this year demand for the SEAI retrofit schemes has been exceptionally high with a very significant increase in the number of applications to date, when compared with the same period in 2021. This strong pipeline of projects is expected to translate into delivery in the months to come.  I have outlined a flavour of the intensive work under way and planned, which will make an extraordinary difference to the lives both of older and disabled people, in particular the review under way on the suite of adaptation grants for older people and people with disability. The points raised in the motion before us today are welcome. This is a welcome contribution in addressing some of the issues affecting grant applicants. I believe this debate today will prove invaluable to that review. Careful consideration will be given to the views expressed here today, as part of that review.	spk_17
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-04-26	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_27	I thank the Deputy for the question. The European and global oil markets are currently volatile due to the conflict in Ukraine exacerbating pre-existing market shortages, primarily of diesel. This has caused a spike in the price of crude and of refined products on the retail market. The Government is fully aware of the significant financial impact that rising fuel prices is having on the haulage sector and has been engaged with sectoral representatives in that regard. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I met the IRHA on 10 December 2021 and again on 10 February 2022 to discuss the issue, as well as the need for the heavy goods vehicle sector to make progress towards decarbonisation. With the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine however, fuel prices escalated further. We met the IRHA again in that context on 9 March last. Recognising that this sudden increase in fuel price was a problem in particular for the licensed haulage sector, on 15 March 2022, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I proposed to the Government an emergency support measure, namely, the licensed haulage emergency support scheme. The scheme will provide support of €100 per week for eight weeks for each eligible heavy goods vehicle, HGV, authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. The scheme is being administered by the Department of Transport. In addition, the Government has provided for an excise duty reduction on mineral oil taxes with effect from 10 March. This saw a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction on auto diesel. These measures were VAT-inclusive and were proposed to last until 31 August. On 11 April, the Government extended the period of the reduced rates out to budget day. This measure is a benefit to all citizens and businesses to mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases. However, it should be noted that the causes of these increases are not within the control of the Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis.	spk_443

The Government can do so much in regard to cushioning people from the rising cost of fuel but there is also a strong recognition from the Government of the importance of the haulage sector, in particular for our essential supply chain. That is why I, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Government moved in regard to this scheme, which is being processed at the moment and the deadline for that is 29 April. We also have the diesel rebate scheme, which was introduced back in 2013, extended by the Minister for Finance and then, in 2020, due to concerns around Brexit, extended further. This is going to be constantly reviewed. I and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will continue our engagement with the haulage sector because we know how vital it is in regard to the supply of essential goods across the country and beyond.	spk_445
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-04-26	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_27	We have to acknowledge the work that is ongoing within the Department in regard to the current €100 per week scheme. Those in the haulage sector are applying for that. It is going to run for an eight-week period and it will be reviewed thereafter. As I said, we will continue our engagement, as we have done, with the Irish Road Haulage Association and the wider sector in regard to the needs around logistics and the supply chain, as well as working on the ten-year road haulage strategy. We are also working with the Department of Social Protection around recruitment and with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on work permits. Significant work has happened around the work permits and also in regard to the diesel rebate scheme. As I said in my earlier contribution, there have been reductions in excise that will not only benefit road hauliers but wider business as well in regard to the rising cost of living.	spk_447
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-04-26	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_27	I thank the Deputy for his question. The shared island fund is allocated by the Department of the Taoiseach to approved collaborative North-South projects that implement the Government’s investment commitments and objectives on a shared island as set out in the programme for Government and the shared island dimension of the revised National Development Plan 2021-2030, including the Government’s commitments under the New Decade, New Approach agreement of January 2020. There is no Government undertaking to provide financial assistance to City of Derry Airport. Under the New Decade, New Approach agreement the Government committed to conducting a review of the viability of air routes from Dublin to Derry and from Cork to Belfast, which has been progressed by my Department in consultation with officials in the Department of the Taoiseach. I and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, are considering that review in consultation with Government colleagues, and the Government will continue to engage with the Northern Ireland Executive and UK Government as appropriate and with stakeholders in the north-west region on this exercise. As the Deputy knows, the regional airports programme supports regional connectivity to the north-west region. We have a PSO air service between Donegal and Dublin. I know the Deputy is very familiar with it. This marks the Government's commitment to ensuring continued connectivity to the region for the next three years. That commenced on 26 February. Also in line with the Government's commitment to regional balanced development, that Donegal-Dublin PSO air service supports the growth of the economy through tourism, supporting the region, providing really critical travel needs to those travelling to Dublin for medical and other important appointments. This review is ongoing within our Department. I and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will be working with the Department of the Taoiseach and my Government colleagues regarding the other services.	spk_469

We are working with the Department of the Taoiseach in respect of that. It is also important to say that the City of Derry Airport is already in receipt of funding support from Derry City and Strabane District Council and has received funding from the Northern Ireland Executive and the Department of Transport in the UK, including most recently a £3 million grant announced by the Northern Ireland Executive last month. The Deputy can be assured that the work is ongoing. The Department of the Taoiseach is involved in this as well and there will be a governmental decision with the Department of Transport in respect of these routes.	spk_471
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-04-26	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_27	I thank the Deputy. Again I want to say that as part of the programme for Government regional connectivity is absolutely critical. There have been limited funding resources even around the regional airports programme and there are lots of requests to come in under that, including for the City of Derry Airport. To be very to the point, there are limited resources. Particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic we wanted to try to support our regional airports as much as possible in the midst of a crisis. I can say to the Deputy that the review is currently under consideration and I and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, are working with the Department of the Taoiseach and will be looking at those routes as well. They will be under active consideration.	spk_473
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-04-26	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_27	As in passenger transport, enabling the freight sector and businesses to avail of cleaner and more efficient delivery alternatives will be necessary to reduce Ireland's transport emissions and meet our climate goals. Currently, heavy goods vehicles account for around 20%, and light goods vehicles for 18% of national transport emissions. In the coming months, my Department will publish a ten-year strategy for the haulage sector. The Government's aim is to develop a strategy that will focus on generating efficiencies and improving standards. This strategy will include considerations on the decarbonisation of last-mile deliveries. Work on the strategy is ongoing with a plan for further consultation with the public and stakeholders in the coming months. While emissions reduction for our HGV sector has particular challenges given that low-emissions technology remains in development, electrification is a realistic option for last-mile deliveries in our towns and urban centres. Our Climate Action Plan 2021 targets 95,000 electric vans in use by 2030. In that regard, the cross-departmental electric vehicle policy pathway working group will consider the regulatory, financial and taxation policies to help achieve this target. For urban commercial journeys, the Government will also continue to promote greater sustainable mobility by encouraging the use of e-cargo bikes. The public sector will have an important role in leading and encouraging businesses to make this shift, and a number of local authorities have already introduced e-cargo bike pilots for local businesses that are proving popular. I would also note in particular the example of An Post's efforts in attaining zero emissions delivery status in our major cities. These examples demonstrate that shifting to cleaner last-mile delivery options makes sense for business and will help to make our urban centres safer and healthier. All of these measures will continue to be supported by the enhanced investment we are making in walking and cycling infrastructure across the country.	spk_475
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-04-26	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_27	Much really good work is happening across some of our local authority areas. There are pilot schemes in place. Dún-Laoghaire Rathdown County Council is piloting cargo bikes for businesses. It is a six-month cargo-bike pilot scheme. Cork City Council has the cargo bike library. In this regard, some €45,000 has been provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with the aim of establishing a cargo bike fleet library. Businesses and community groups will be allowed to borrow a bike for six months as part of a trial scheme to determine whether a cargo bike could be used daily. Dublin City Council has a pilot for e-cargo bikes for businesses. It was launched late last year following the success of the Dún-Laoghaire Rathdown pilot. A similar scheme was launched by Fingal County Council. It is important that we acknowledge the leadership shown by An Post. It has over 1,000 electric vehicles, including 155 e-trikes. An Post is the first postal service in the world to attain zero-emission delivery status in all the major cities.	spk_477
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-04-26	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_27	The EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme focuses on optimising logistics. This is all part of what we are looking at through the ten-year haulage strategy. The programme is called SENATOR and the aim behind it is to create a new urban logistics model for enhancing city sustainability. The project will develop a smart network operator as a control tower supported on an ICT platform that will work as a support tool for decision-making, integrating and the planning of logistics operations. These are the ideas we are looking for in the public consultation on the ten-year haulage strategy. It is for the industry to come forward with its ideas so we can integrate, consider schemes, run pilots and determine what works. We call on everyone in the supply-chain sector to feed into our ten-year haulage strategy. That will lower emissions, but also improve efficiencies within the sector.	spk_479

These examples demonstrate that shifting to cleaner last-mile delivery options makes sense for business and will help to make our urban centres safer and healthier. All of these measures will continue to be supported by the enhanced investment we are making in walking and cycling infrastructure across the country.	spk_475

There are pilot schemes in place. Dún-Laoghaire Rathdown County Council is piloting cargo bikes for businesses. It is a six-month cargo-bike pilot scheme. Cork City Council has the cargo bike library. In this regard, some €45,000 has been provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with the aim of establishing a cargo bike fleet library. Businesses and community groups will be allowed to borrow a bike for six months as part of a trial scheme to determine whether a cargo bike could be used daily. Dublin City Council has a pilot for e-cargo bikes for businesses. It was launched late last year following the success of the Dún-Laoghaire Rathdown pilot. A similar scheme was launched by Fingal County Council. It is important that we acknowledge the leadership shown by An Post. It has over 1,000 electric vehicles, including 155 e-trikes. An Post is the first postal service in the world to attain zero-emission delivery status in all the major cities.	spk_477
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-04-26	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_34	The EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme focuses on optimising logistics. This is all part of what we are looking at through the ten-year haulage strategy. The programme is called SENATOR and the aim behind it is to create a new urban logistics model for enhancing city sustainability. The project will develop a smart network operator as a control tower supported on an ICT platform that will work as a support tool for decision-making, integrating and the planning of logistics operations. These are the ideas we are looking for in the public consultation on the ten-year haulage strategy. It is for the industry to come forward with its ideas so we can integrate, consider schemes, run pilots and determine what works. We call on everyone in the supply-chain sector to feed into our ten-year haulage strategy. That will lower emissions, but also improve efficiencies within the sector.	spk_479

As Members are aware, Shannon Group informed my Department in summer 2020 that it was necessary to consider a comprehensive and radical adjustment to its structure. This was necessary due to the capital investment required to maintain the heritage sites and the lack of expertise in maintaining the sites in the group. This was further impacted by the onset of Covid-19. In 2021 several options were presented in a memorandum for Government, and the Government considered that the most appropriate option was for Shannon Group to explore the potential to transfer Shannon Heritage to the local authorities. It was considered that this was the best way to secure the longer term viability of the business and the interests of Shannon Heritage employees, while maintaining the intrinsic heritage value of the sites for current and future generations. Since that time Shannon Group has engaged and is continuing to engage with the relevant local authorities in regard to the transfer of the business of these key sites. This includes the transfer of King John's Castle to Limerick City and County Council. The agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be required to execute the transfer of the castle. My Department is engaging with both Departments in this regard. I am also continuing to engage with the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in regard to the conservation of the castle. As the castle is a national monument, the OPW has responsibilities in regard to its conservation and maintenance. In preparation for undertaking this role, the OPW has been carrying out the necessary assessment of the castle to inform the programme of works needed and the associated costs. Shannon Group will continue to operate and manage the Shannon Heritage business prior to any transfer of King John's Castle to Limerick City and County Council. It will do so in line with its commercial mandate and fiduciary best practice, and with awareness of the group's accountability for the proper management of the company. This Government implemented a range of horizontal economy-wide supports early in the Covid-19 pandemic. Shannon Heritage has benefited from these supports including the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS. The continuation of Government support to Shannon Group through the subsequent extension of EWSS enabled King John's Castle to remain open during the winter of 2021, and into the spring of this year. Although the castle operated with reduced opening hours during this time, EWSS support meant that Shannon Group did not have to close the castle completely in September 2021 for the winter season as had been previously indicated. As we all know, Covid-19 has had a huge impact on all tourism and heritage sites since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are grounds for optimism, as the Deputy highlighted, including a welcome increase in visitor numbers. I understand King John's Castle is currently open seven days a week, as the Deputy stated. My Department will continue to work with Shannon Group and the relevant Departments to ensure the transfer of King John's Castle will proceed as planned, placing it in a positive position to benefit from increased visitor numbers. The Deputy made reference to the deadline of 4 April. I assure him there is ongoing engagement between my Department, the Department of Transport, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage around that funding gap and there are meetings. We have asked the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to engage with us to see what we can do to try to bridge that funding gap. Officials from my Department are meeting with their counterparts in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media today. We have had previous meetings. Fáilte Ireland will be present at that meeting in regard to looking at other funding sources.

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_2	The Deputy will have been aware that the Doolin volunteer team was stood down due to concerns about the safety of its operations in the circumstances pertaining at the time. I am happy to confirm that the unit has been reconstituted on an interim basis, with a core group of volunteers who, the Coast Guard believes, can work and operate together. This follows extensive engagement by Coast Guard management with volunteers in Doolin, culminating in my appointment of Mr. Kieran Mulvey as mediator. Mr. Mulvey’s report made a number of recommendations in respect of the service in Doolin. I can advise that the Coast Guard is currently fully engaged in the process of rebuilding the Doolin unit, guided by the recommendations outlined in Mr. Mulvey’s report which was issued on 10 December 2021. The serving Doolin volunteers were advised by letter on 16 December 2021 that the previous unit had been stood down on a permanent basis, with all volunteer memberships terminated. Mr. Mulvey advised that the Coast Guard and my Department should move with immediate effect to reconstitute the Doolin unit and to reinstate those members of the unit who management in the Coast Guard believe can work and operate together in a collegiate and co-operative manner. The report advised that the reconstituted unit should be given sufficient time to develop a culture between them of mutual respect and trust. It was also recommended that, within a further period and when deemed appropriate, a further expansion of the unit should be considered to build the unit back up to full strength from local volunteers, and preferably before next summer. I can confirm that the selection of volunteers to provide service to the reconstituted unit has been completed and those selected have been informed. Management within the Coast Guard will soon commence the process of recruitment to the Doolin unit on a permanent basis. Once the detailed arrangements for the process have been finalised, all Doolin current and former volunteers will be advised of those arrangements and the timeframes which will apply to the submission of applications. We expect to be in contact with all former volunteers in relation to this recruitment process by mid-April 2022, bearing in mind Mr. Mulvey’s recommendation to allow the reconstituted unit sufficient time to develop a culture between them of mutual respect and trust.	spk_9

It is difficult to comment on the numbers of the reconstituted team. There will perhaps be 12 members of the team to start with. Currently, additional cover is being provided from Kilkee and Killaloe. Helicopter and other emergency services are also being provided. The other recommendations of the Mulvey report are being actioned by the Coast Guard in relation to the areas outlined by the Deputy. As part of the recommendations, I have recommended an associated review of the Coastal Unit Advisory Group, CUAG, which is the official representative group of the volunteers. I have recommended that the CUAG's terms of reference, grievance, complaints and disciplinary procedures are reviewed. That was also a recommendation of the Mulvey report. I have recommended that that review is completed by the end of this month. It is absolutely critical. The CUAG members are working with the Coast Guard on that to ensure that the CUAG plays a very strong representative role, representing the volunteers of the Coast Guard. Along with my officials, I have been engaging on a regular basis with the CUAG in relation to that work.	spk_11
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_2	What we all want is a fully functioning Coast Guard in Doolin. It is important to state that the current and only recognised representative group for volunteers is the CUAG, which has been in existence for more than 20 years. What I want to do, and what is happening as part of this review, is to ensure that any gaps that are there from the CUAG's perspective, whether around grievance or disciplinary procedures, are addressed and volunteers are represented fully. According to the terms of reference, the CUAG is the representative group. It acts as the consultative body on matters pertaining to management, training, equipment, administration and roles of the Coast Guard unit. The CUAG has been very effective. This review is going to be key to ensuring that the CUAG has a very strong representative role in relation to HR matters, including grievance procedures, and how they work. That is the work that is ongoing as part of the review of the terms of reference. That was also a recommendation made in Mr. Mulvey's report. The work that is currently being done, hand in hand with the Coast Guard, is absolutely critical to ensuring that volunteers have all the equipment and wherewithal to deal with grievances and issues that arise. We must remember that these people are volunteering across the country. We must ensure that they are equipped to carry out their role.	spk_13
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputy for raising the issues currently facing the transport sector and hauliers, in particular. The current spike in energy prices arises from the global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic in conjunction with current international tensions and supply constraint issues. It is being witnessed across the European Union as well as many other regions. In order to mitigate the impact of fuel price increases for hauliers, the diesel rebate scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators.In light of the challenges arising from Brexit and the uncertainty facing the sector, in budget 2020 the marginal rate of compensation at prices over €1.32, VAT inclusive, was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre in recognition of the vital role of the haulage sector to the economy. In addition, businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs such as road diesel and other motoring costs. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I met with the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, on 10 December 2021 and again on 10 February 2022 to discuss the spike in fuel prices for hauliers and the need for the sector to make progress towards decarbonisation. Although no way forward was agreed at those meetings, discussions on these issues are ongoing at official level.  Similarly, the driver shortage is not a problem confined just to Ireland. It has been a growing issue across Europe and globally for several years. It is a multifaceted issue with a range of contributing factors, including the pandemic, which has clearly had a significant impact on many sectors. In 2019, my Department established the national logistics and supply chain skills group, the key objective of which is to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in the logistics and supply chain sector. The group includes haulage and logistics sector industry representatives, education and training providers and all the relevant Departments. Last year, I asked the group to examine the HGV driver shortage.	spk_17
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputy. I am not taking away from the crisis for the sector, but just to outline what the Government has done, in budget 2020, arising from Brexit challenges, the marginal rate of compensation relating to the diesel rebate scheme was doubled. That increase has been maintained since. In budget 2022 there was an expansion of the accelerated capital allowance scheme for gas vehicles and refuelling equipment. There is also the alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicle purchase grant scheme of March 2021 which had a significant uptake within the sector. That is not to take away from the points the Deputy is raising in respect of the impact on the haulage sector. I will be the first to say there are no alternatives for hauliers at the moment. Decarbonisation is critical and they have said they are up for that. We are dealing with a crisis in fuel prices. There are extra pressures as a result of what is happening in Ukraine. I and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, are engaging with the sector and considering what can be done to provide reliefs for hauliers, who are under particular stress at the moment.	spk_19
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_2	On the final issue raised by the Deputy, the logistics supply chain group is working with all stakeholders to consider, and ensure movement is happening on, issues within the logistics and supply chain sector. That includes the skills shortage. It involves working with the third level sector and raising awareness of the apprenticeships in Institute of Technology Sligo and the technological universities in Cork and Dublin, as well as communicating the courses and careers that are available. That work is ongoing. We are working with the Department of Social Protection on recruitment drives to attract hauliers here and to encourage Irish people to engage in these apprenticeships. The cost of fuel is a key crisis at the moment. I have been engaging constantly with the IRHA, which has been very proactive and constructive with me and departmental officials to try to find a solution. There is no lack of will but these things will take time. Given the impact of Covid and what is happening in Ukraine, the crisis is evolving. The Deputy can be assured that engagement will continue and we will try to find a solution to support the sector. That is something on which I am very much working.	spk_21
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_2	Irish driving licence law is framed by the requirements of EU legislation. Under the EU directives, a person with an identified or specified illness, such as diabetes, is required to provide a medical report when applying for a learner permit or driving licence. The medical report must be completed by a general practitioner, GP, and a licence may be issued for one, three or ten years. The period of issue is based on the GP's assessment of the applicant and his or her recommendation. This is based on the medical advice determined by a GP when the person presents to him or her. A clinical guidance document, Sláinte agus Tiomáint Medical Fitness to Drive Guidelines, is compiled by the Road Safety Authority in conjunction with the National Office for Traffic Medicine. It provides guidelines for medical professionals to assist in their assessment of an individual applicant's fitness to drive a motor vehicle. A ten-year driving licence costs €55. A reduced fee of €35 is charged for a three-year licence, while there is no charge for a one-year licence. I hear the concerns the Deputy is raising in respect of the costs and I will certainly follow up with the RSA in respect of the cost differential.	spk_23
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_2	I will contact the RSA on the licence fee issue. The other issue may be a Department of Health one as it involves going to a doctor for a medical checkup. It is not my area but I do not believe that is covered by the GP card. I will certainly talk to the RSA around the licence fee issue. I reiterate that this is a vital road safety tool and I appreciate the Deputy has not questioned that. GPs have to do their work and many conditions are degenerative or may be volatile if they are not managed properly. That is where the GP's expertise comes in, where patients may require regular monitoring to determine if they are safe to drive. I will also say that not all licences for people with a specified condition are issued for shorter periods. It is up to the GP and contingent on his or her clinical assessment of that. I will commit to speaking to the RSA on the fees question.	spk_25
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_2	Just to confirm, my understanding is that the GPs do not have to issue shorter licence periods for specified illnesses. It is up to them, as they are the medical experts, to give the clinical assessment as to somebody's ability to drive. It is completely within their remit. That comes from the National Office for Traffic Medicine, which was jointly established by the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland and the Road Safety Authority, and which brings the specialty of traffic medicine to Ireland.

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Coast Guard Service	dbsect_4	The Deputy will have been aware that the Doolin volunteer team was stood down due to concerns about the safety of its operations in the circumstances pertaining at the time. I am happy to confirm that the unit has been reconstituted on an interim basis, with a core group of volunteers who, the Coast Guard believes, can work and operate together. This follows extensive engagement by Coast Guard management with volunteers in Doolin, culminating in my appointment of Mr. Kieran Mulvey as mediator. Mr. Mulvey’s report made a number of recommendations in respect of the service in Doolin. I can advise that the Coast Guard is currently fully engaged in the process of rebuilding the Doolin unit, guided by the recommendations outlined in Mr. Mulvey’s report which was issued on 10 December 2021. The serving Doolin volunteers were advised by letter on 16 December 2021 that the previous unit had been stood down on a permanent basis, with all volunteer memberships terminated. Mr. Mulvey advised that the Coast Guard and my Department should move with immediate effect to reconstitute the Doolin unit and to reinstate those members of the unit who management in the Coast Guard believe can work and operate together in a collegiate and co-operative manner. The report advised that the reconstituted unit should be given sufficient time to develop a culture between them of mutual respect and trust. It was also recommended that, within a further period and when deemed appropriate, a further expansion of the unit should be considered to build the unit back up to full strength from local volunteers, and preferably before next summer. I can confirm that the selection of volunteers to provide service to the reconstituted unit has been completed and those selected have been informed. Management within the Coast Guard will soon commence the process of recruitment to the Doolin unit on a permanent basis. Once the detailed arrangements for the process have been finalised, all Doolin current and former volunteers will be advised of those arrangements and the timeframes which will apply to the submission of applications. We expect to be in contact with all former volunteers in relation to this recruitment process by mid-April 2022, bearing in mind Mr. Mulvey’s recommendation to allow the reconstituted unit sufficient time to develop a culture between them of mutual respect and trust.	spk_9

It is difficult to comment on the numbers of the reconstituted team. There will perhaps be 12 members of the team to start with. Currently, additional cover is being provided from Kilkee and Killaloe. Helicopter and other emergency services are also being provided. The other recommendations of the Mulvey report are being actioned by the Coast Guard in relation to the areas outlined by the Deputy. As part of the recommendations, I have recommended an associated review of the Coastal Unit Advisory Group, CUAG, which is the official representative group of the volunteers. I have recommended that the CUAG's terms of reference, grievance, complaints and disciplinary procedures are reviewed. That was also a recommendation of the Mulvey report. I have recommended that that review is completed by the end of this month. It is absolutely critical. The CUAG members are working with the Coast Guard on that to ensure that the CUAG plays a very strong representative role, representing the volunteers of the Coast Guard. Along with my officials, I have been engaging on a regular basis with the CUAG in relation to that work.	spk_11
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Coast Guard Service	dbsect_4	What we all want is a fully functioning Coast Guard in Doolin. It is important to state that the current and only recognised representative group for volunteers is the CUAG, which has been in existence for more than 20 years. What I want to do, and what is happening as part of this review, is to ensure that any gaps that are there from the CUAG's perspective, whether around grievance or disciplinary procedures, are addressed and volunteers are represented fully. According to the terms of reference, the CUAG is the representative group. It acts as the consultative body on matters pertaining to management, training, equipment, administration and roles of the Coast Guard unit. The CUAG has been very effective. This review is going to be key to ensuring that the CUAG has a very strong representative role in relation to HR matters, including grievance procedures, and how they work. That is the work that is ongoing as part of the review of the terms of reference. That was also a recommendation made in Mr. Mulvey's report. The work that is currently being done, hand in hand with the Coast Guard, is absolutely critical to ensuring that volunteers have all the equipment and wherewithal to deal with grievances and issues that arise. We must remember that these people are volunteering across the country. We must ensure that they are equipped to carry out their role.	spk_13
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_5	I thank the Deputy for raising the issues currently facing the transport sector and hauliers, in particular. The current spike in energy prices arises from the global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic in conjunction with current international tensions and supply constraint issues. It is being witnessed across the European Union as well as many other regions. In order to mitigate the impact of fuel price increases for hauliers, the diesel rebate scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators.In light of the challenges arising from Brexit and the uncertainty facing the sector, in budget 2020 the marginal rate of compensation at prices over €1.32, VAT inclusive, was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre in recognition of the vital role of the haulage sector to the economy. In addition, businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs such as road diesel and other motoring costs. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I met with the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, on 10 December 2021 and again on 10 February 2022 to discuss the spike in fuel prices for hauliers and the need for the sector to make progress towards decarbonisation. Although no way forward was agreed at those meetings, discussions on these issues are ongoing at official level.  Similarly, the driver shortage is not a problem confined just to Ireland. It has been a growing issue across Europe and globally for several years. It is a multifaceted issue with a range of contributing factors, including the pandemic, which has clearly had a significant impact on many sectors. In 2019, my Department established the national logistics and supply chain skills group, the key objective of which is to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in the logistics and supply chain sector. The group includes haulage and logistics sector industry representatives, education and training providers and all the relevant Departments. Last year, I asked the group to examine the HGV driver shortage.	spk_17
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_5	I thank the Deputy. I am not taking away from the crisis for the sector, but just to outline what the Government has done, in budget 2020, arising from Brexit challenges, the marginal rate of compensation relating to the diesel rebate scheme was doubled. That increase has been maintained since. In budget 2022 there was an expansion of the accelerated capital allowance scheme for gas vehicles and refuelling equipment. There is also the alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicle purchase grant scheme of March 2021 which had a significant uptake within the sector. That is not to take away from the points the Deputy is raising in respect of the impact on the haulage sector. I will be the first to say there are no alternatives for hauliers at the moment. Decarbonisation is critical and they have said they are up for that. We are dealing with a crisis in fuel prices. There are extra pressures as a result of what is happening in Ukraine. I and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, are engaging with the sector and considering what can be done to provide reliefs for hauliers, who are under particular stress at the moment.	spk_19
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_5	On the final issue raised by the Deputy, the logistics supply chain group is working with all stakeholders to consider, and ensure movement is happening on, issues within the logistics and supply chain sector. That includes the skills shortage. It involves working with the third level sector and raising awareness of the apprenticeships in Institute of Technology Sligo and the technological universities in Cork and Dublin, as well as communicating the courses and careers that are available. That work is ongoing. We are working with the Department of Social Protection on recruitment drives to attract hauliers here and to encourage Irish people to engage in these apprenticeships. The cost of fuel is a key crisis at the moment. I have been engaging constantly with the IRHA, which has been very proactive and constructive with me and departmental officials to try to find a solution. There is no lack of will but these things will take time. Given the impact of Covid and what is happening in Ukraine, the crisis is evolving. The Deputy can be assured that engagement will continue and we will try to find a solution to support the sector. That is something on which I am very much working.	spk_21
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_6	Irish driving licence law is framed by the requirements of EU legislation. Under the EU directives, a person with an identified or specified illness, such as diabetes, is required to provide a medical report when applying for a learner permit or driving licence. The medical report must be completed by a general practitioner, GP, and a licence may be issued for one, three or ten years. The period of issue is based on the GP's assessment of the applicant and his or her recommendation. This is based on the medical advice determined by a GP when the person presents to him or her. A clinical guidance document, Sláinte agus Tiomáint Medical Fitness to Drive Guidelines, is compiled by the Road Safety Authority in conjunction with the National Office for Traffic Medicine. It provides guidelines for medical professionals to assist in their assessment of an individual applicant's fitness to drive a motor vehicle. A ten-year driving licence costs €55. A reduced fee of €35 is charged for a three-year licence, while there is no charge for a one-year licence. I hear the concerns the Deputy is raising in respect of the costs and I will certainly follow up with the RSA in respect of the cost differential.	spk_23
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_6	I will contact the RSA on the licence fee issue. The other issue may be a Department of Health one as it involves going to a doctor for a medical checkup. It is not my area but I do not believe that is covered by the GP card. I will certainly talk to the RSA around the licence fee issue. I reiterate that this is a vital road safety tool and I appreciate the Deputy has not questioned that. GPs have to do their work and many conditions are degenerative or may be volatile if they are not managed properly. That is where the GP's expertise comes in, where patients may require regular monitoring to determine if they are safe to drive. I will also say that not all licences for people with a specified condition are issued for shorter periods. It is up to the GP and contingent on his or her clinical assessment of that. I will commit to speaking to the RSA on the fees question.	spk_25
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-03	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_6	Just to confirm, my understanding is that the GPs do not have to issue shorter licence periods for specified illnesses. It is up to them, as they are the medical experts, to give the clinical assessment as to somebody's ability to drive. It is completely within their remit.

I assure the Deputy that I will continue to support Shannon Group in its engagement with the relevant local authorities to secure the future of the sites currently within Shannon Heritage. I advise the Deputy that Shannon Group continues to work with the relevant local authorities, including Clare County Council, to reach agreement on the transfer of Shannon Heritage sites and its business. My Department is engaging with Shannon Group, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to ensure the smooth transfer of these sites. As the Deputy will be aware, the transfer of the sites is subject to agreement between the parties, completion of the required due diligence and the applicable consents of the Ministers for Transport and Public Expenditure and Reform. The agreement of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will also be required. I also advise the Deputy that the Office of Public Works, OPW, has agreed to re-engage on its maintenance responsibilities and role in respect of the maintenance of Bunratty Castle and King John's Castle. In preparation for undertaking this role, the OPW has been carrying out the necessary assessments of both buildings to inform the programme of works needed and the associated costs. My Department continues to engage with the OPW in that regard. I assure the Deputy that the Government acknowledges and appreciates the strategic importance of these heritage sites to the mid-west region and the country's tourism offering and the contribution they make to our built heritage. I understand that Bunratty Castle and King John's Castle are currently open on a four-day-week basis until March 2022. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that it is envisaged that those sites will reopen fully in April. I am also happy to report that, as the public health restrictions put in place due to Covid were eased in the second half of 2021, visitor numbers to Shannon Heritage sites have increased. With the removal of all the restrictions and the return of transatlantic flights into Shannon Airport this month, I am confident that visitor numbers to the sites will continue to grow.	spk_77

Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-03-02	dail	33	National Driver Licence Service: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	"I thank the Deputies concerned for tabling this motion on the national driver licence service, NDLS. The Government will not be opposing the motion. At the outset I would like to clarify that the NDLS front offices across the nation are open to the public. The only change since the new contract came into effect in June 2021 is that there is no longer an option to attend at an office without a prior appointment. Appointments can be may online or by telephone. A public services card, PSC, is not required to book an appointment. The NDLS, which processes applications for and issues driving licences and learner permits, is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority, RSA. The service is provided to the RSA under contract. The NDLS front office service commenced in 2013 as a non-appointment service. An appointment service was subsequently provided to manage queues. Under this, people with an appointment had preference and attendance without an appointment was facilitated if time permitted. The contracted service in place since 2013 ended in 2021 and a replacement NDLS front office service contract was procured. The procurement process for the new contract began in January 2020. It was not intended that the new contract, which took effect in June 2021, would offer a non-appointment option. This decision was made based on experience with the previous contract that managing a non-appointment element was difficult. RSA market analysis, ahead of procurement of the current service contract, showed that more bids and better value for money would be attainable for an appointment-only service. Such a service gives certainty to customers and prevents overcrowding, queueing and long waits. The non­appointment service had generated complaints from members of the public due to waiting times and delays. It also allows the provider to manage resourcing of the service because demand is predictable rather than having peaks and troughs during the day. It should be noted that the procurement process did not prohibit tenderers from offering a non­appointment service. Four bids were received, each of a high standard. Following assessment under the published assessment criteria, the tender was awarded to the incumbent, SGS Ireland Limited, a Swiss company that has been active in Ireland for over 40 years, operates over 34 offices nationwide, and provides extensive services across a range of sectors. The contract has a term of two operational years from June 2021 to June 2023, with possible extensions to June 2025. An Post tendered for the contract but was unsuccessful. The procurement process and contract were totally compliant with EU and national law. The requirements for the new contract differ from the predecessor as demand for the front office service is declining with the growth in the NDLS online service. The ability of companies to manage and adapt staffing requirements was an important element of the current contract. The decision to move to an appointment-only service was supported by the online licence renewal and application service, which accounts for over 40% of total applications, and the option for older customers to apply by post. The change was communicated to the public on the NDLS website and in renewal reminder notices. The existing service had moved to an appointment-only system from June 2020 because of Covid-19 restrictions before the new service began in June 2021. Therefore, an appointment-only service was in place one year before the new NDLS front office contract commenced. The current contract has virtually the same capacity and opening hours as the previous contract. It was expected that the NDLS front office capacity would be reducing in the lifetime of the new contract as the take up of the online service increases. In practice, the centres are now catering for more applications than originally forecasted for this time due to the effect of the licence and learner permit extensions. The effects of the extensions will apply until September of this year. The same network of 34 permanent offices has been retained from the old to the new contract. The only reductions are two satellite centres which were open one day per week in Belmullet and Clifden. Approximately 20 to 30 appointments per week were catered for between both of these centres. These have not been retained due to the provision of an online service. Any significant change to the current contract would involve a contractual change and have commercial implications for the service. It is the RSA's opinion that the introduction of a non-appointment service would in fact diminish the quality of the service to the public. An applicant is required to present photographic ID and evidence of Personal Public Service, PPS, number, address and residency entitlement when applying for a licence. Applications may be made in person at a NDLS office, where the required documents are examined and a face-to-face verification is made. A PSC is not required for an NDLS application made in an NDLS office. It may be used to establish identity but it is not mandatory and an applicant may use one of several options. For online applications, the same information is required but verifying a person's identity is more difficult online. A MyGovlD account, which requires a PSC, satisfies this requirement. Legal proceedings, in which the Department of Social Protection appealed an enforcement notice from the Data Protection Commission, DPC, on processing of personal data for PSCs, were resolved in December 2021. The agreement reached acknowledged that other public bodies listed in social welfare legislation, that is ""specified bodies"", may use the PSC as a means of verifying the identity of the people they deal with, provided that they also accept other methods of authenticating identity. The agreement also acknowledges and accepts that the Department of Social Protection and other specified bodies can continue to use MyGovlD as the sole means of authenticating identity for the purpose of accessing online services, provided that an alternative service channel is made available. The Road Safety Authority is a specified body for the use of a PSC under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009. Applicants who do not have a PSC may apply for or renew a licence in person at an NDLS office. Payment at the NDLS offices can be made by credit card, debit card, Google Pay, Apple Pay or Payzone vouchers. Payzone vouchers can be purchased from retailers in towns and villages nationwide. Card payment is significantly the most predominant means of payment. The NDLS allows an accompanying person make card payments for customers who do not have cards themselves. The decision was made not to accept cash after a market sounding exercise where only one potential bidder advocated accepting cash payments. The decision was made after evaluating security, administration and value for money factors. As I mentioned earlier, appointments to attend at a NDLS front office can be made by telephone as well as online. Currently, 29,000 appointment slots are free out of 77,000 slots available for booking across a six week period. There is currently a high renewal demand for driving licences and learner permits due to the extensions put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic coming to an end. The RSA acknowledges the service provided to customers in the phone booking service in this period has been less than adequate. I have heard the concerns of Deputies in that regard today. At a minimum, three full­time agents are necessary to provide the required level of service on the booking line. The service provider is working to ensure that these resources are available daily and are committing extra personnel to training to ensure that the three full-time staff members are assisted and supported through busy periods. The RSA has been assured that once training is completed this week, the service to the public will be greatly improved. It should be noted that where people are late for an appointment, they cannot always be accommodated.Where possible, however, every effort is made to accommodate them. No permanent NDLS offices have been closed. The services provided in Belmullet and Clifden were temporary and were set up to operate in hotels in those towns one day a week. Approximately 20 to 30 appointments per week were catered for between the two. The feedback from the market analysis conducted was that these two centres were not required in order to provide a strong service to the public. The provision of these temporary services was not included within the successful SGS proposal in response to the tender process. Some NDLS front offices have had to close on some days or to offer a reduced service in the past few months because of absences due to Covid-19 pressures. The RSA is working to restore the service, with all centres open for the full contracted hours as soon as possible."	spk_34

However, with the recruitment of an additional staff member, capacity will increase shortly. No-show rates in Ennis in January were 12.3% of all booked appointments. To date in February, it is tracking at 13.3%. These are the highest no-show figures in the country. There is 35.48% availability of slots nationwide, which is equivalent to 26,496 appointments. The NDLS front office has been challenged due to some absences caused by Covid but has maintained a full service, with minimum disruption and with completed applications being processed within three to five working days. Due to the high demand for appointments, customers are asked to ensure that they attend at their appointed time. Where appointments are not held on time, this affects the service for the following appointments. Where a customer no longer wishes to keep a booked appointment, he or she is asked to cancel that appointment so that it can be made available to others looking for bookings. An online service is available for all application types and customers can apply or renew their driving licence or learner permit at 	spk_304

The new staff member in Ennis will start on 28 February, which will increase capacity by 25%. There are two booths available, but the service is currently operating with 1.5. I have been assured by RSA that the staffing changes will improve the backlog. Those who have booked an appointment should please cancel if they are not going to attend because others are waiting. On the telephone line, I can go back to the RSA regarding waiting times and raise the issue of people trying to contact the office. I can appreciate that people cannot get online and are not getting through on the phone line that is being provided. I will revert to the Deputy in terms of the operational management of that system.	spk_306
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-02-16	dail	33	Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces: Statements	dbsect_16	I thank everyone who spoke for their contributions on this very important subject. Providing for the defence of the state is a fundamental role of any government. Each country addresses its needs in the context of its geopolitical position, prevailing security environment and the level of funding available. As part of the defence planning process, the White Paper on Defence in 2015 and the White Paper update of 2019 were based on security environment assessments carried out by the interdepartmental working groups. These threat assessments indicated a low probability of a conventional military attack on the State and pointed to the fact that security challenges are such that no single country can deal with them alone.  The commission's report covers a number of distinct areas to be given careful consideration. The levels of ambition set out vary considerably. The recommended first step to LOA 2 from current capability requires a 50% increase to current defence spending. The personnel increase recommended under LOA 2 would require an increase of over 3,000 personnel above current strength. Even with an increased capacity to induct and train recruits and cadets, such an increase would require a number of years to implement.Similarly, the recommended equipment capabilities would require lead-in times, following in-depth analysis of exactly what function these platforms and capabilities were to fulfil. The structural changes recommended would be the most significant in the defence sector since the foundation of the State and would be a major shift from delegating military command from the Minister to a number of senior military ranks to delegating it from the Minister to one individual, the chief of defence. This and other structural recommendations, due to their significance and impact, require detailed cross-departmental discussion and deliberation. They will also require the input of legal expertise, as any changes in this area would most likely require changes to legislation. The report has a major focus on people issues. The people who serve in the Defence Forces, both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force, are their greatest asset. They will be central to changes arising from this report. There are wide-ranging and significant recommendations in the report. While there are policies, systems and procedures currently in place for dealing with allegations and complaints of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace, it is clear from the strong views expressed at the meetings the Minister has had with stakeholders, including serving members, Women of Honour and the men and women of honour group, that the pervading culture in the Defence Forces and those policies, systems and procedures have not served, and are not serving, all Defence Forces personnel well. In response, the Minister established the independent review into dignity and equality issues in the Defence Forces to ensure the Defence Forces are a safe workplace for all current serving members, while also reviewing historical allegations.  The commission makes recommendations around strategic HR development and working arrangements to reflect the changes that have occurred in the wider employment area, to encourage retention and to facilitate more flexible working arrangements. The commission recommends a number of civilian appointments within the Defence Forces' structure, such as the head of transformation already mentioned but also possibly in the area of strategic HR and finance and possible greater civilianisation of certain posts which would free up military personnel for front-line duties.  The commission also makes recommendations around pay structures but it must be pointed out that their terms of reference did not include reviewing pay rates. Public sector pay policy is within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Now that the commission has finished its work, and in keeping with the commitment in the programme for Government, the Minister for Defence will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body. The Minister for Defence is keen to make the Defence Forces an employer of choice. The Defence Forces offer an interesting, exciting and varied career for people and it is important that the positive aspects of a life serving in the Defence Forces are made clear, together with the totality of the benefits of working in the Defence Forces. The Reserve Defence Force has seen a reduction in numbers in recent years. The commission is clear in its ambition in this area and how the knowledge, skills and experience within the RDF ranks can be better captured and utilised. The Reserve is a key aspect of contingent capability and improvements are required in how we recruit and utilise the Reserve. This report gives an opportunity to revitalise the RDF and better employ the skills of its members. The report's finding on the level of defence funding is clear and highlights the difference between defence funding in Ireland and other western and northern European countries of similar size. This reflects the differing priority given to defence spending in these countries and their own geopolitical considerations. The White Paper highlighted the importance of capability development and since 2015, over €806 million has been invested in the renewal, upgrade and acquisition of military equipment and infrastructure. Capital spending has increased from €89.4 million in 2015 to €129.5 million in 2021. This is an increase of €40.1 million or 45% on 2015 expenditure. In the future, multi-annual capital funding of €566 million has been allocated to defence out to 2025 under the national development plan, with €141 million provided in 2022. While this has been a positive development, the commission's report highlights the scale of the challenge that exists in bridging capability gaps. There have been calls for quick movement on the recommendations within the report and the Minister is keen to do so, where possible, but there are significant recommendations that must be discussed and considered fully and their possible implications examined. The commission acknowledged in its report that some of the recommendations will impact significantly on current governance structures. Subject to Government decisions on the report, the future governance and oversight framework of the Minister and the Department of Defence may need to be redesigned to provide effective assurance and accountability. As this was outside its terms of reference, it was not developed in the commission's report and, therefore, will require significant work to explore and align the ramifications of certain recommendations and that, in turn, will determine how other recommendations progress. Other aspects to be investigated will also include any possible legislative impacts and what changes this will require. A number of recommendations and commentary in the report concern other Departments and agencies, and these will require interdepartmental consultation and consideration to fully explore the best way forward on these issues. Significant work is currently ongoing, which the commission has referred to in its report, as was outlined at the beginning of this debate. This important work will continue. As the Minister said in his opening statement, he wants to ensure that he is committed to progressing the work carried out by the commission and seizing this opportunity to develop Defence Forces that are agile and modern, designed not just for today but for the future. The Minister welcomes the debate on this important subject. There needs to be a wider debate on defence provision in Ireland beyond the normal actors. The Minister looks forward to expanding this debate and encouraging open discussion around the serious issues and recommendations in the commission report. The Minister intends to examine the use of seminars or other consultative structures to encourage and lead this debate. He may not agree with all that has been said today but the Minister welcomes the fact that we are having the discussion and thanks all Deputies for their contributions. Further discussion will be required as part of the deliberations on this significant report. I encourage all Deputies to be a part of that conversation.	spk_291
Hildegarde Naughton	51	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2022-01-27	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Reachtaíocht a Gealladh - Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_28	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The safe routes to school programme is a programme I am rolling out across the country. We are investing €1 million per day in walking and cycling infrastructure throughout the country. This is enabling the schools to work directly with the local authorities and An Taisce on projects and measures specific to schools in specific areas. This is not only being rolled out to specific or urban areas, but also to our towns and villages. Earlier this week, on Monday, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I announced a significant funding of €289 million for active travel, which will feed into the safe routes to school programme as well.	spk_212
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	The current spike in energy prices arises principally from the global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. It has implications across the economy. With regard to the impact on transport, the Government will continue to monitor impacts on trade and key supply chains as it has done through the challenges arising from Brexit and the pandemic. Road hauliers are currently supported in the cost of diesel through the diesel rebate scheme, introduced in 2013. In budget 2020, in recognition of the challenging environment the haulage industry faced at that time with regard to the prospect of a disorderly Brexit, the scheme was enhanced to the extent that when the retail price of auto diesel is over €1.07, the marginal rate of compensation increases to 60% of the excise paid up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre when the price of auto diesel is €1.16 or over. In recognition of the vital role the haulage sector plays in the economy, the 2020 enhancement has been maintained since. It is worth noting also that businesses registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs, such as road diesel and other motoring costs. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I met with representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, on 10 December to discuss a range of issues, including fuel prices, decarbonisation of the heavy goods vehicle, HGV, sector and skills issues, including the HGV driver shortage. At the meeting with IRHA, the Minister and I agreed to consider a proposal to expand the relief available to hauliers under the diesel rebate scheme, but with a link to the phasing out of older, more polluting vehicles and an overall reduction in emissions from the sector. Details of that proposal are to be submitted by the IRHA to the Department. The meeting was constructive. We will meet the IRHA again in the new year. On supports for taxi drivers, the vast majority of measures we have taken in support of the taxi industry from the start of the pandemic remain in place.	spk_2
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	I am okay, thank you. I appreciate that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. On the pandemic unemployment payment for small public service vehicle, SPSV, drivers, we all acknowledge how that industry has been hit during the pandemic. As many as 70% of them availed of the PUP at the height of the pandemic and, as the Deputy may be aware, the PUP has been reopened for a limited time to support people who lose their employment as a result of Covid. The self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to €960 in a given eight-week period. There is also an enterprise support grant of €1,000 for drivers coming off the PUP that can go towards the costs associated with returning to work, personal protective equipment, PPE, etc. There have been waivers of the licensing fee and a refund of motor tax for taxi drivers. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has met on a number of occasions with the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles - that is a statutory committee established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 - and he has been discussing many of the issues affecting the industry at present. My time has run out. I will let the Deputy back in.	spk_5
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	On the Minister, Deputy Ryan's engagement with the taxi industry, he has met representatives on several occasions, including representatives of several taxi unions twice. Last month, the Minister met a representative of the taxi dispatch operators. Other members of Government, including the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, have also met with taxi driver representatives. As I say, the self-employed operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to €960 in any given eight-week period, and the other supports that were in place throughout the pandemic continue. I refer to the motor tax rebate. Even the age of your vehicle now has been extended to the end of 2022. There are a number of supports there. On the haulage sector, our meeting with the IRHA last week was very constructive. This is, I acknowledge, a sector that is very challenged in reducing emissions. There are no alternatives there - nothing, that is, in the short term. That is why we are waiting on the IRHA to come back to work with us in relation to a proposal around that. I have been engaging with association representatives over a number of months on a number of issues related to the driver shortage as well as skills and I have to say my meetings with them have been very constructive.	spk_7
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	The Minister for Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding for public transport. The National Transport Authority, NTA, has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally and for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network. The NTA works with the relevant public transport operators responsible for day-to-day operational issues to make public transport accessible. The Department of Transport and its agencies are progressively making public transport accessible for all, and especially for persons with disabilities, in both urban and rural areas. This is being done by ensuring new infrastructure and services are accessible from the start and by retrofitting older infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible for persons with disabilities, persons with reduced mobility and older people. The Department provides dedicated, ring-fenced funding to the NTA for its multi-annual public transport accessibility programme. In addition, through the funding from the Department of Transport, the NTA provides a gamut of supports to assist persons with disabilities to travel independently on public transport. For example, the travel assistance scheme provides assistance for people who need it to use public transport or plan journeys on Dublin Bus, Luas, Go-Ahead and DART services. It is a free service run by Dublin Bus and is available within the greater Dublin area for people aged 18 and over. In addition, the just a minute, JAM, card has been available for use on public transport services since 2019 and enables people with a communication barrier to tell others discreetly and easily that they need just a minute. Furthermore, disability awareness training is provided by all public transport operators to their staff to assist persons with disabilities to travel on public transport services. I am aware of the concerns outlined in the report on the cost of transport for persons with disabilities, which are primarily related to more personalised or individualised transport requirements, which in many cases have an important role to play. Of course, specialised non-public door-to-door services do not form part of the public transport sector for which the Department of Transport has statutory responsibility.	spk_9
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	I assure the Deputy that my Department is actively engaging with the relevant agencies and Departments to strengthen the public transport offerings throughout the country by providing additional funding for increased public transport services. The Government has committed to using the research into the cost of disability to inform future policy direction, and the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, steering group, chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will consider actions required by Departments on foot of this report. The Department of Transport and its agencies will continue to play their part in making public transport accessible and will, through our membership of the NDIS group, work with the other Departments that have responsibility for individualised, personalised transport support schemes. I could list the other initiatives on which we are currently working, but they are in the reply.	spk_11
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	I hear what the Deputy is saying. The NDIS steering group will be key in this area to ensure a whole-of-government approach. The NDIS sets out the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society. It aims to improve the lives of people with disabilities and contains precise, measurable actions and timescales for delivery. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has overarching responsibility for the implementation of the NDIS. The strategy contains six public transport related actions for which the Department, the NTA and public operators have lead responsibility. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is leading the establishment of a working group under another action to consider the integration of disability transport and mobility support services. Monitoring of the implementation of the strategy is being overseen by the NDIS, which comprises key Departments. This will be an all-of-government approach.	spk_13
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	The programme for Government committed that €360 million in cross-Government funding will be spent on walking and cycling per annum over the lifetime of the Government. This investment will help support the delivery of almost 1,000 km of improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025, as well as additional investment in greenways. The total expenditure delivered on active travel through my Department in 2020 was €108 million, with €8.3 million also spent on greenways. This year, we have seen a significant increase in delivery and expenditure on active travel infrastructure, with the provisional spend for 2021 at €185 million. This is in addition to approximately €27 million spent on greenways in 2021. Focusing on active travel, this year €281 million was available for active travel projects in the greater Dublin area, regional cities and rural areas. This provided for approximately 1,200 active travel projects to be developed across the country, in cities, towns and rural areas. Therefore, overall, there has been a large increase in the delivery and expenditure on active travel between 2020 and 2021, although it is also true there has been a significant underspend compared with available funds. The NTA is the main agency spearheading the delivery of cycling and walking infrastructure, with the local authorities. Factors constraining delivery of active travel infrastructure this year included the impact of Covid restrictions, planning issues and staffing constraints. However, the larger budgets and projects are now bedding in, new staff are being recruited by the local authorities, and the situation is improving. We expect a much higher drawdown on available funds next year and increased delivery. The NTA is working with local authorities to ensure effective and efficient delivery of active travel funding. Details of the active travel projects to be funded and delivered next year are being developed by the NTA and can be made available to the Deputy when this is finalised in January. It is anticipated that approximately €290 million will be available next year to help roll out walking and cycling infrastructure throughout the country. I am happy that 2021 has been a year of very significant delivery on cycling and walking infrastructure despite Covid and other challenges. It is apparent all around the country that progress is being made.	spk_15
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	The reason for the underspend is that it was the first year and staffing was an issue. I will give the statistics. As per the quarter 3 report from the NTA supplied to my Department, 92 new positions have been filled across local authorities out of a total of about 250 allowed. This includes staff in local authorities outside of the greater Dublin area and regional cities, where, until this year, there were no NTA-funded active travel staff in place. In the coming weeks, the NTA will provide its quarter 4 report on the resourcing plan where we expect a significant increase in the number of positions filled. There will be a lot of pressure on local authorities next year. Now that they have increased resources in-house, we expect them to be able to roll out these active travel projects across the country. I will get the Deputy the exact figures in regard to his earlier question and I will provide them to him separately.	spk_17
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	It is important to bear in mind the challenges this year in regard to Covid. The level 5 restrictions had an impact on the roll-out of greenways because those projects were not seen as essential projects during the level 5 restrictions, which meant any non-essential construction could not occur during those months. That has impacted on the roll-out of a number of those projects. All local authorities spent much of this year recruiting new staff after that formal authorisation was given to them in March to recruit NTA-funded staff. The NTA will be driving that. Obviously, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I have allocated a lot of funding for active travel throughout the country. It is imperative that agencies working with local authorities and the local authorities, which will be over the roll-out of many of these projects, prioritise these projects over the next 12 months. Now that the allocation of resources is there, the excuses are not there for any kind of slowdown or delays for many of these projects to be rolled out.	spk_19
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	I am delighted to see the new BusConnects Dublin network being rolled out. I agree with the Deputy that it is important that people have an opportunity to give feedback and their thoughts on its roll-out. It is great to see improvements happening on the ground with this year’s launch of the H spine and the C spine. Next year will see further phases of the new network rolled out, while planning applications for the core bus corridors will also be lodged with An Bord Pleanála. I am sure all of us who campaign for improved public transport welcome these developments. I would also like to acknowledge that consultation with the public and stakeholders has been an integral part of the BusConnects programme and has positively influenced its development so far. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the breadth and depth of public engagement on BusConnects Dublin is certainly unique in a transport context and quite possibly in any public policy context. In terms of the new services that have been rolled out already, the National Transport Authority and the bus operators are keeping all aspects of the new network under scrutiny and are closely monitoring the new services following their introduction. All households in the areas served by the H spine and C spine received information booklets as the services were introduced and those booklets provide information on how to provide feedback and comment, whether by telephone, email or online. If there are issues in regard to the phone lines being engaged, I will raise that with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, as well as any other barriers for people in trying to submit their comments. Those feedback channels are in addition to the three rounds of public consultation that informed the development of the new network and the 72,000 submissions received as part of those consultation processes. Therefore, while I agree with the Deputy that feedback is important, I think the channels already established would seem to be appropriate at this stage. If, as the Deputy said, they cannot get through for whatever reason on the telephone line, there is an email and online method as well. Nonetheless, if there are challenges around that, I will certainly raise that with the Minister, Deputy Ryan.	spk_21
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	I will forward the Deputy’s comments to the Minister, Deputy Ryan. The information I have is there are channels and clear information for people to make their complaints and give their comments around existing services. I know the NTA is liaising closely with the transport operators in reviewing the introduction of these new services and it will take appropriate action, where necessary, to mitigate the impact of these services. I will certainly relay the Deputy’s comments back to the Minister, Deputy Ryan. With regard to the core bus corridors, the NTA intends to re-engage with the community forums established during earlier consultation phases on the core bus corridors as the various schemes proceed to construction. The NTA is also establishing a transport users advisory group. The purpose of that group will be to provide advice and recommendations to the NTA from the perspective of both the transport users and those engaged in active travel. That advisory group will provide the NTA with the viewpoints that can feed into future policy and programmes as they are implemented.	spk_23

Some 15 places will be available on that transport users advisory group and that will be made up of representation from various modes of public transport such as cyclists, pedestrians, people with disabilities, older persons, business tourism, students, small public service vehicles, and a Local Link expert. I will relay the Deputy’s concerns about being able to relay her feedback and getting through to the phone line to the Minister.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	In addition to the primary function of our commercial State ports to facilitate maritime transport, the national ports policy 2013 also recognises the role ports can also play in servicing the offshore renewable energy, ORE, sector and the need for further port capacity in this area. The programme for Government has set a target for 70% of electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2030 and for 5 GW of offshore wind by 2030. The climate action plan, published on 4 November 2021, has since increased the target to 80% renewable electricity by 2030. Both plans also set out how Ireland will take advantage of the potential of at least 30 GW of floating offshore wind power in our deeper waters in the Atlantic. Given Ireland’s increased ambition in ORE and pending a review of the overall national ports policy in 2022, my Department, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office, conducted an assessment of the options for Irish State ports to facilitate the ORE sector and assist in Ireland achieving its emission reduction targets. Taking account of the conclusions and recommendations of that assessment, I have decided that a multi-port approach will be required to address the needs of the ORE industry and a policy statement will be issued in the near future setting out this approach. ORE will develop in phases on the east, south, south-west and west coasts, and a multiple of ports will be required to provide facilities for the different activities at several locations around the country and at different times for the various phases of the fixed and floating ORE developments. This multi-port approach will help maximise the economic benefits at regional as well as national level in terms of the creation of jobs and new SME enterprise that can support the development of the ORE industry. Funding for ORE-related port infrastructure is available under the connecting Europe funding, CEF, facility which is the funding instrument for the EU's trans-European transport network, TEN-T. My Department is assisting, as appropriate, the eligible TEN-T ports.	spk_27
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	A policy statement signalling the multi-port approach was prepared in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. That was presented to the Cabinet committee on environment and climate change on 8 December and went to Government on 14 December. The policy statement is in line with the existing national ports policy, which recognises the role of commercial State ports in servicing offshore renewable energy. The policy statement reiterates that position and signals the Government’s commitment to ORE developers on the provision of port facilities in Ireland. On the opportunities around this, a multi-port approach will help to maximise the economic benefits at a regional and national level. The Department is assisting, as appropriate, the eligible TEN-T ports to put forward applications for studies or works related to the provision of offshore renewable energy infrastructure at their ports.	spk_29
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_3	The objective of achieving that 5 GW of installed offshore wind by 2030 will be met primarily through the deployment of fixed pile turbines off the east and south-east coasts. This is because of more favourable sea areas with significant water available at depths of under 60 m, combined with proximity to an existing and relatively strong onshore transmission system. It is intended the 5 GW target will be facilitated through two phases of offshore wind deployment with two specific auctions to take place under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, 1 and RESS 2. A consultation to inform the approach to the second phase will include the option of including some floating offshore wind as a special category in RESS 2. The significant potential for offshore renewable energy in the Atlantic is not envisaged until later in the decade. On port timelines, Wicklow Port and Arklow Harbour have entered into arrangements with individual offshore renewable energy project developers to serve as operation and maintenance spaces. Plans are also under way for the deployment of facilities at Rosslare Europort and Cork Dockyard. Drogheda Port is proposing to develop large-scale deepwater port facilities on the east coast, and Shannon Foynes Port Company and the ESB are planning a large-scale redevelopment in the Shannon Estuary at Foynes.	spk_31

On the pandemic unemployment payment for small public service vehicle, SPSV, drivers, we all acknowledge how that industry has been hit during the pandemic. As many as 70% of them availed of the PUP at the height of the pandemic and, as the Deputy may be aware, the PUP has been reopened for a limited time to support people who lose their employment as a result of Covid. The self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to €960 in a given eight-week period. There is also an enterprise support grant of €1,000 for drivers coming off the PUP that can go towards the costs associated with returning to work, personal protective equipment, PPE, etc. There have been waivers of the licensing fee and a refund of motor tax for taxi drivers. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has met on a number of occasions with the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles - that is a statutory committee established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 - and he has been discussing many of the issues affecting the industry at present. My time has run out. I will let the Deputy back in.	spk_5

Last month, the Minister met a representative of the taxi dispatch operators. Other members of Government, including the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, have also met with taxi driver representatives. As I say, the self-employed operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to €960 in any given eight-week period, and the other supports that were in place throughout the pandemic continue. I refer to the motor tax rebate. Even the age of your vehicle now has been extended to the end of 2022. There are a number of supports there. On the haulage sector, our meeting with the IRHA last week was very constructive. This is, I acknowledge, a sector that is very challenged in reducing emissions. There are no alternatives there - nothing, that is, in the short term. That is why we are waiting on the IRHA to come back to work with us in relation to a proposal around that. I have been engaging with association representatives over a number of months on a number of issues related to the driver shortage as well as skills and I have to say my meetings with them have been very constructive.	spk_7
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_5	The Minister for Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding for public transport. The National Transport Authority, NTA, has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally and for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network. The NTA works with the relevant public transport operators responsible for day-to-day operational issues to make public transport accessible. The Department of Transport and its agencies are progressively making public transport accessible for all, and especially for persons with disabilities, in both urban and rural areas. This is being done by ensuring new infrastructure and services are accessible from the start and by retrofitting older infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible for persons with disabilities, persons with reduced mobility and older people. The Department provides dedicated, ring-fenced funding to the NTA for its multi-annual public transport accessibility programme. In addition, through the funding from the Department of Transport, the NTA provides a gamut of supports to assist persons with disabilities to travel independently on public transport. For example, the travel assistance scheme provides assistance for people who need it to use public transport or plan journeys on Dublin Bus, Luas, Go-Ahead and DART services. It is a free service run by Dublin Bus and is available within the greater Dublin area for people aged 18 and over. In addition, the just a minute, JAM, card has been available for use on public transport services since 2019 and enables people with a communication barrier to tell others discreetly and easily that they need just a minute. Furthermore, disability awareness training is provided by all public transport operators to their staff to assist persons with disabilities to travel on public transport services. I am aware of the concerns outlined in the report on the cost of transport for persons with disabilities, which are primarily related to more personalised or individualised transport requirements, which in many cases have an important role to play. Of course, specialised non-public door-to-door services do not form part of the public transport sector for which the Department of Transport has statutory responsibility.	spk_9
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_5	I assure the Deputy that my Department is actively engaging with the relevant agencies and Departments to strengthen the public transport offerings throughout the country by providing additional funding for increased public transport services. The Government has committed to using the research into the cost of disability to inform future policy direction, and the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, steering group, chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will consider actions required by Departments on foot of this report. The Department of Transport and its agencies will continue to play their part in making public transport accessible and will, through our membership of the NDIS group, work with the other Departments that have responsibility for individualised, personalised transport support schemes. I could list the other initiatives on which we are currently working, but they are in the reply.	spk_11
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_5	I hear what the Deputy is saying. The NDIS steering group will be key in this area to ensure a whole-of-government approach. The NDIS sets out the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society. It aims to improve the lives of people with disabilities and contains precise, measurable actions and timescales for delivery. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has overarching responsibility for the implementation of the NDIS. The strategy contains six public transport related actions for which the Department, the NTA and public operators have lead responsibility. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is leading the establishment of a working group under another action to consider the integration of disability transport and mobility support services. Monitoring of the implementation of the strategy is being overseen by the NDIS, which comprises key Departments. This will be an all-of-government approach.	spk_13
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Cycling Facilities	dbsect_6	The programme for Government committed that €360 million in cross-Government funding will be spent on walking and cycling per annum over the lifetime of the Government. This investment will help support the delivery of almost 1,000 km of improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025, as well as additional investment in greenways. The total expenditure delivered on active travel through my Department in 2020 was €108 million, with €8.3 million also spent on greenways. This year, we have seen a significant increase in delivery and expenditure on active travel infrastructure, with the provisional spend for 2021 at €185 million. This is in addition to approximately €27 million spent on greenways in 2021. Focusing on active travel, this year €281 million was available for active travel projects in the greater Dublin area, regional cities and rural areas. This provided for approximately 1,200 active travel projects to be developed across the country, in cities, towns and rural areas. Therefore, overall, there has been a large increase in the delivery and expenditure on active travel between 2020 and 2021, although it is also true there has been a significant underspend compared with available funds. The NTA is the main agency spearheading the delivery of cycling and walking infrastructure, with the local authorities. Factors constraining delivery of active travel infrastructure this year included the impact of Covid restrictions, planning issues and staffing constraints. However, the larger budgets and projects are now bedding in, new staff are being recruited by the local authorities, and the situation is improving. We expect a much higher drawdown on available funds next year and increased delivery. The NTA is working with local authorities to ensure effective and efficient delivery of active travel funding. Details of the active travel projects to be funded and delivered next year are being developed by the NTA and can be made available to the Deputy when this is finalised in January. It is anticipated that approximately €290 million will be available next year to help roll out walking and cycling infrastructure throughout the country. I am happy that 2021 has been a year of very significant delivery on cycling and walking infrastructure despite Covid and other challenges. It is apparent all around the country that progress is being made.	spk_15
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Cycling Facilities	dbsect_6	The reason for the underspend is that it was the first year and staffing was an issue. I will give the statistics. As per the quarter 3 report from the NTA supplied to my Department, 92 new positions have been filled across local authorities out of a total of about 250 allowed. This includes staff in local authorities outside of the greater Dublin area and regional cities, where, until this year, there were no NTA-funded active travel staff in place. In the coming weeks, the NTA will provide its quarter 4 report on the resourcing plan where we expect a significant increase in the number of positions filled. There will be a lot of pressure on local authorities next year. Now that they have increased resources in-house, we expect them to be able to roll out these active travel projects across the country. I will get the Deputy the exact figures in regard to his earlier question and I will provide them to him separately.	spk_17
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Cycling Facilities	dbsect_6	It is important to bear in mind the challenges this year in regard to Covid. The level 5 restrictions had an impact on the roll-out of greenways because those projects were not seen as essential projects during the level 5 restrictions, which meant any non-essential construction could not occur during those months. That has impacted on the roll-out of a number of those projects. All local authorities spent much of this year recruiting new staff after that formal authorisation was given to them in March to recruit NTA-funded staff. The NTA will be driving that. Obviously, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I have allocated a lot of funding for active travel throughout the country. It is imperative that agencies working with local authorities and the local authorities, which will be over the roll-out of many of these projects, prioritise these projects over the next 12 months. Now that the allocation of resources is there, the excuses are not there for any kind of slowdown or delays for many of these projects to be rolled out.	spk_19
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_7	I am delighted to see the new BusConnects Dublin network being rolled out. I agree with the Deputy that it is important that people have an opportunity to give feedback and their thoughts on its roll-out. It is great to see improvements happening on the ground with this year’s launch of the H spine and the C spine. Next year will see further phases of the new network rolled out, while planning applications for the core bus corridors will also be lodged with An Bord Pleanála. I am sure all of us who campaign for improved public transport welcome these developments. I would also like to acknowledge that consultation with the public and stakeholders has been an integral part of the BusConnects programme and has positively influenced its development so far. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the breadth and depth of public engagement on BusConnects Dublin is certainly unique in a transport context and quite possibly in any public policy context. In terms of the new services that have been rolled out already, the National Transport Authority and the bus operators are keeping all aspects of the new network under scrutiny and are closely monitoring the new services following their introduction. All households in the areas served by the H spine and C spine received information booklets as the services were introduced and those booklets provide information on how to provide feedback and comment, whether by telephone, email or online. If there are issues in regard to the phone lines being engaged, I will raise that with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, as well as any other barriers for people in trying to submit their comments. Those feedback channels are in addition to the three rounds of public consultation that informed the development of the new network and the 72,000 submissions received as part of those consultation processes. Therefore, while I agree with the Deputy that feedback is important, I think the channels already established would seem to be appropriate at this stage. If, as the Deputy said, they cannot get through for whatever reason on the telephone line, there is an email and online method as well. Nonetheless, if there are challenges around that, I will certainly raise that with the Minister, Deputy Ryan.	spk_21
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_7	I will forward the Deputy’s comments to the Minister, Deputy Ryan. The information I have is there are channels and clear information for people to make their complaints and give their comments around existing services. I know the NTA is liaising closely with the transport operators in reviewing the introduction of these new services and it will take appropriate action, where necessary, to mitigate the impact of these services. I will certainly relay the Deputy’s comments back to the Minister, Deputy Ryan. With regard to the core bus corridors, the NTA intends to re-engage with the community forums established during earlier consultation phases on the core bus corridors as the various schemes proceed to construction. The NTA is also establishing a transport users advisory group. The purpose of that group will be to provide advice and recommendations to the NTA from the perspective of both the transport users and those engaged in active travel. That advisory group will provide the NTA with the viewpoints that can feed into future policy and programmes as they are implemented.	spk_23

Some 15 places will be available on that transport users advisory group and that will be made up of representation from various modes of public transport such as cyclists, pedestrians, people with disabilities, older persons, business tourism, students, small public service vehicles, and a Local Link expert.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_8	In addition to the primary function of our commercial State ports to facilitate maritime transport, the national ports policy 2013 also recognises the role ports can also play in servicing the offshore renewable energy, ORE, sector and the need for further port capacity in this area. The programme for Government has set a target for 70% of electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2030 and for 5 GW of offshore wind by 2030. The climate action plan, published on 4 November 2021, has since increased the target to 80% renewable electricity by 2030. Both plans also set out how Ireland will take advantage of the potential of at least 30 GW of floating offshore wind power in our deeper waters in the Atlantic. Given Ireland’s increased ambition in ORE and pending a review of the overall national ports policy in 2022, my Department, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office, conducted an assessment of the options for Irish State ports to facilitate the ORE sector and assist in Ireland achieving its emission reduction targets. Taking account of the conclusions and recommendations of that assessment, I have decided that a multi-port approach will be required to address the needs of the ORE industry and a policy statement will be issued in the near future setting out this approach. ORE will develop in phases on the east, south, south-west and west coasts, and a multiple of ports will be required to provide facilities for the different activities at several locations around the country and at different times for the various phases of the fixed and floating ORE developments. This multi-port approach will help maximise the economic benefits at regional as well as national level in terms of the creation of jobs and new SME enterprise that can support the development of the ORE industry. Funding for ORE-related port infrastructure is available under the connecting Europe funding, CEF, facility which is the funding instrument for the EU's trans-European transport network, TEN-T. My Department is assisting, as appropriate, the eligible TEN-T ports.	spk_27
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_8	A policy statement signalling the multi-port approach was prepared in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. That was presented to the Cabinet committee on environment and climate change on 8 December and went to Government on 14 December. The policy statement is in line with the existing national ports policy, which recognises the role of commercial State ports in servicing offshore renewable energy. The policy statement reiterates that position and signals the Government’s commitment to ORE developers on the provision of port facilities in Ireland. On the opportunities around this, a multi-port approach will help to maximise the economic benefits at a regional and national level. The Department is assisting, as appropriate, the eligible TEN-T ports to put forward applications for studies or works related to the provision of offshore renewable energy infrastructure at their ports.	spk_29
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Ports Policy	dbsect_8	The objective of achieving that 5 GW of installed offshore wind by 2030 will be met primarily through the deployment of fixed pile turbines off the east and south-east coasts. This is because of more favourable sea areas with significant water available at depths of under 60 m, combined with proximity to an existing and relatively strong onshore transmission system. It is intended the 5 GW target will be facilitated through two phases of offshore wind deployment with two specific auctions to take place under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, 1 and RESS 2. A consultation to inform the approach to the second phase will include the option of including some floating offshore wind as a special category in RESS 2. The significant potential for offshore renewable energy in the Atlantic is not envisaged until later in the decade. On port timelines, Wicklow Port and Arklow Harbour have entered into arrangements with individual offshore renewable energy project developers to serve as operation and maintenance spaces. Plans are also under way for the deployment of facilities at Rosslare Europort and Cork Dockyard. Drogheda Port is proposing to develop large-scale deepwater port facilities on the east coast, and Shannon Foynes Port Company and the ESB are planning a large-scale redevelopment in the Shannon Estuary at Foynes.	spk_31
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	The standards for and issuing of driving licences are covered by EU directives, transposed into national law by member states.EU Directive 2006/126/EC on driving licences sets out, among other matters, minimum standards of driving fitness for all drivers, covering medical conditions that affect driving and setting out restrictions on the ability to hold a licence. Member states may, if they choose, apply higher standards in their own jurisdictions. Under Irish law, a person aged 70 or over must provide a medical report from their GP when applying for or renewing a driving licence, regardless of health status. Depending on the report, the applicant may be granted a licence for one or three years. On consideration of the current position, I have accepted a recommendation from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, that the initial age for mandatory medical testing, where an applicant is not otherwise required to supply a medical report, should be increased from 70 to 75. This change will require amendments to the relevant regulations. The regulatory amendments required are being progressed and the estimated date of implementation is currently February 2022. However, this will depend on legal advice and the availability of drafting resources. In Ireland all driving licence applicants must complete a self-declaration on driver fitness. Drivers aged over 70 and those with a specified condition must produce a medical report with their application. The National Office for Transport Medicine wrote to the RSA in January 2019 recommending that the requirement for routine medical certification of drivers over 70 be lifted. However, the authority noted that public perception of mandatory medical testing for older drivers is reasonably favourable, even if it is not supported by available research.  We hope that the new regulation will be in place by February 2022.	spk_35
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	I hear the Deputy's concerns about trying to expedite this. The February 2022 date will depend on the legal advice and the availability of drafting resources. I take Deputy Moynihan's point regarding the pressure on GPs at the moment. In order to address the social distancing requirements and the additional burdens on our medical services during the pandemic, the requirement for those over 70 to provide a medical report was temporarily removed in order to protect our citizens and take pressure off our medical services. From March 2020 to June 2021 people aged 70 or over could apply to renew their driver licence without a medical report where they did not have an identified or specified illness. To date, there has been no indication of any negative effects on road safety because of this concession. I take the Deputy's points on board and if I can get more information on that February 2022 timeline, I will revert to him on it.	spk_37

I know the issue of a rail link to Navan was one of several that generated a significant number of submissions during the original public consultation held by the NTA in November 2020. The GDA transport strategy is subject to a formal statutory approval process and will ultimately be submitted for ministerial approval in 2022. Therefore, it is not appropriate at this juncture to speak about prioritisation of one particular project over another. As the Deputy is aware, there is a long lead-in time for big projects like this. If it is included in the final strategy, this project will require significant planning and design before it is shovel-ready. As it stands, the draft strategy, which covers all modes of transport and all counties in the GDA, proposes delivery of the Navan rail line in the latter half of the strategy period. On the proposal itself, the background report prepared for the NTA considered again the strategic rationale for such a rail link. It considered rail and bus options, re-examined the potential alignments of a rail link and provided a high-level assessment of cost and demand. While the benefit-to-cost ratio returned by the economic assessment was less than that seen for some other projects, the report concluded there was a strong strategic rationale for the proposal and that is why it has been brought forward for inclusion in the draft strategy. Consultation on the draft strategy is currently open and is running until 17 December. I encourage the Deputy to make the case for the rail link in the final version of the	spk_41

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	We can all acknowledge that transitioning the haulage sector to low or zero carbon will be more challenging than other road transport sectors given the size and weight of trucks and the distances they travel. Ireland’s HGV fleet is particularly reliant on fossil fuels, specifically diesel. Biofuels will help with the transition. The renewable fuels for transport policy statement which was published last month sets out a future trajectory of increase in biofuels use in land transport in line with climate action plan targets to 2030, as well as a range of measures and incentives for future supply of renewable fuels such as biomethane and green hydrogen. As the initial investment in alternative fuel technology for HGVs is expensive at the moment, the Government is providing incentives to the sector to make the transition. The alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicle purchase grant scheme, which is administered by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, is intended to help to bridge some of the difference in purchase price between conventional heavy-duty vehicles and those powered by alternatively fuelled power-trains. Some €2 million was allocated to this scheme in 2021. Given the excellent response to the initiative, the Department allocated an additional €1 million in funds this year to assist the heavy-duty vehicle sector in its transition to zero-emission mobility. Funds for 2021 have now been fully allocated, but the scheme will continue in 2022 with further funding available. The Department has also commissioned a number of studies to identify actions that haulage operators and companies can take to reduce carbon and other emissions. These include a road freight decarbonisation study co-funded with TII and three research projects with Trinity College Dublin and University College Cork. Collectively, these projects will form a substantial evidence base on which a longer-term decarbonisation strategy can be developed. We are also developing our ten-year haulage strategy, which will be focused on improving efficiencies and standards, and on helping the haulage sector to move to a low-carbon future.	spk_47
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	The ten-year haulage strategy is focusing on a number of issues. Reducing emissions in the sector is one issue. The other issues include how we are dealing with the driver shortage and how to make the profession more attractive. There has been the first phase of a public consultation, with further consultation on the draft strategy next year. Between Covid, Brexit and other challenges facing the industry, this is a really good time to get the feedback from the industry on how we can support the sector and the supply chain. We have seen how reliant and flexible it was through the Brexit transition. Our supply chain was robust. They were flexible, as they told us they would be. We were all fearful about the transition on 1 January but the sector has really done us proud. We need to ensure we support it in every way possible. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I met representatives of the IRHA last week to discuss many of these issues.	spk_49
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	At our meeting with the IRHA last week, we discussed issues around fuel prices, the decarbonisation of the HGV sector and the HGV driver shortage. The Minister and I agreed at the meeting to consider a proposal from the IRHA to expand the relief available to hauliers under the diesel rebate scheme, but with a link to the phase-out of older, more polluting vehicles and an overall reduction in emissions from the sector. Details of the proposal are to be submitted to the Department for further consideration and we will meet the IRHA again in the new year. It is a sector that is very challenged and needs to be supported. One way is through the alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicles scheme, which is a medium- to long-term solution for the sector as new technologies come on board. In the meantime, the sector does need our support. I have engaged with it a great deal over the last 12 months since I came into this role and that is something I will continue to do along with the Minister.	spk_51
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	In March 2021 the Minister and I were delighted to launch the safe routes to school, SRTS, programme which will support active travel infrastructure for selected schools around the country. The programme aims to support walking, scooting and cycling to primary and post-primary schools and to create safer walking and cycling routes within communities. This will help alleviate congestion at school gates and increase the number of students who walk or cycle to school by providing the necessary infrastructure. All schools were eligible to apply to the programme and information was circulated from the Departments of Education and Transport to schools nationwide. By the deadline of 16 April, 931 applications had been received from schools in every county in Ireland. Following that, 170 schools were notified on 21 June that they have been selected for inclusion in the first round of the safe routes to school programme, including eight schools in Limerick and two schools in Tipperary. Funding of €15 million has been allocated for projects at the 170 schools included in round 1. The subsequent schools will be engaged with on a rolling basis in each local authority area. This funding is being provided from the €1.8 billion funding earmarked in the programme for Government to support sustainable transport. It is important to note that all active travel funding looks to improve links to schools where possible, not only the safe routes to school programme. The required investment at each school will be dependent on the changes required in each particular case. As most interventions at or near applicable schools will take time to implement, especially if they require planning permission, the €15 million budget will extend beyond 2022. The budget for the cycle parking element of the safe routes to school programme in 2022 will be €3 million. The schools selected were assessed against a range of criteria including school type, location and the school’s commitment to sustainable travel. Schools that have applied this year and that have not been included in the first round of funding will not be required to reapply as they will be included on a rolling basis. Thus, we will get through the first 170 and then it will be rolling after that. Hence there are no plans for an additional call for schools to join the programme.	spk_53

In Tipperary they were Gaelscoil Chluain Meala and Loreto Secondary School. It is important to note the other 29 schools in Limerick and the 22 in Tipperary that have applied this year but have not been included in the first round of funding will not be required to reapply. They will come into the programme on this rolling basis. There are different stages. Once a school is completed the local authority moves on to the next schools that have been successful as part of the roll-out to the first 170. It is also important to say safe routes to school programme funding is only one part of the active travel programme. Schools can work directly with local authorities around other active travel projects outside the programme. As the Deputy knows, we have €360 million funding per year for walking and cycling infrastructure that local authorities can tap into also, within towns and villages.	spk_55

At the moment, the six infrastructure officer teams in An Taisce Green Schools are currently working on stage 4 of this process. That is the communication and liaison interventions. The infrastructure officers have now met the majority of round 1 schools to discuss the situation outside those schools, any new information on school locations etc. and possible solutions. In addition, the work that has been undertaken includes a survey of all the schools, parental surveys, front of school audits and walking and cycling audits that are being carried out to assess the existing pedestrian and cycling infrastructure within 500 m of a school. This information is going to inform the process so it is being captured as well. Speed surveys are also being carried out to assess the existing speed outside schools. These data will then help inform the delivery plans and further engage with the school population. The NTA and safe routes to school teams have produced a draft safe routes to school design guide to assist the local authorities to provide the technical guidance. The infrastructure officers are holding weekly meetings with the active travel engineers to update on the safe routes to school programme in Limerick. There are on-site visits to schools, except for Scoil Íde and St. Munchin's College, with executive engineers to discuss the possible measures. Tipperary is holding its discussions. It has weekly meetings in relation to schools in Clonmel. With the roll-out of the resources to the local authorities, we will be monitoring this to ensure these 170 are progressed as quickly as possible. Part of that was to give them the staffing that many of them said they did not have.	spk_57
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	The Minister holds responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. It is the NTA that has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally. The NTA also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of the rural transport programme which operates under the Transport For Ireland Local Link brand. The NTA works with the relevant transport companies that are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the services. From a policy perspective, the Minister has made his beliefs clear that there is a need for a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland. The Department has been undertaking a review of sustainable mobility policy, which incorporates public transport in rural areas. We intend to develop a new policy framework for the next ten years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme and we hope to publish our new sustainable mobility policy early next year.As the Deputy will be aware, the Covid-19 public health emergency has had a profound and swift shock on the public transport sector. Government support for all public transport services in 2020 amounted to €620 million. For 2021, more than €670 million has been provided in public service obligation, PSO, funding in order to ensure the existing level of public transport services, albeit at a higher cost, continue to operate in a safe manner. By comparison, the level of PSO and Local Link funding provided in 2019 was in the region of €300 million. I know of the Deputy's deep interest in the development of public transport services generally and more specifically in respect of the two areas she mentioned. I am advised by the NTA that, in addition to rail services from Laytown, commuter services are provided from Bettystown and Laytown by Matthews Coaches. These are commercial services and are licensed by the NTA. The NTA has no role in the setting of fares for commercial services. On bus services, the NTA has indicated that Bettystown and Laytown are considered suburbs of Drogheda when planning their public transport services. Routes D1 and D2 provide four bus services linking both centres to Laytown station to the south and the town of Drogheda to the north west.	spk_59
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	As the Deputy knows, Laytown station is outside the short hop zone, which goes north as far as Balbriggan. Such stations have fares that are not well suited for the pay-as-you-go service provided by the Transport for Ireland, TFI, Leap card because cardholders would need to maintain a high minimum balance on their Leap cards before they could use them. The best fare for such intercity services is typically obtained by booking in advance, which again is not suited to the TFI Leap card. The NTA is actively investigating alternative ticketing solutions that would be better suited to intercity rail services as part of a next-generation ticketing initiative. The NTA has adjusted a number of fares in order to mitigate the fares charged at the outside edge of the short hop zone. A number of tickets between Gormanston, Laytown and Dublin have either remained at the same price level or seen a reduction since 2018. The NTA is actively engaged on the development of a very flexible TaxSaver ticketing product suitable for occasional use in response to the change in public transport use as a result of Covid-19. It is hopeful of bringing something forward early next year.	spk_61

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 33 and 48 together. I recognise that the SPSV industry has been badly affected during the Covid-19 pandemic that, for an extended period, brought about an almost complete collapse in passenger demand for taxi and other SPSV services. While recent months saw a welcome return of demand, with the NTA reporting 86% of drivers back at work in October, the recent increase in infection rates has given rise to the necessary reintroduction of a number of restrictions. Conscious of the potential impact of such restrictions on affected sectors and society in general, particularly as we approach what is traditionally a busy period around Christmas, the Government has sought to ensure that any restrictions are targeted and appropriate. It is continuing to monitor the situation closely as it develops. In the meantime, I confirm that the vast majority of measures that we have taken to support the taxi industry from the start of the pandemic remain in place. I understand that as many as 70% of SPSV drivers availed of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, at the height of the pandemic. As the Deputy may be aware, the PUP reopened for a limited period to support people who lose their employment as a result of Covid restrictions from Tuesday, 7 December. Self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to €960 in any given eight-week period, net of expenses. Drivers coming off the PUP can avail of the Covid-19 enterprise support grant, worth €1,000, which will meet the costs associated with returning to work and that will remain in place for the rest of the year for self-employed people who close their PUP claim. Taxi drivers can use this grant for the purchase of personal protective equipment, protective screens and cleaning materials. The employment wage subsidy scheme, which provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of eligible employees on the employer’s payroll and gross pay to employees, is now expected to continue until 30 April 2022. In addition, support for SPSV operators continues to be available, both now and into 2022, through a series of specific measures designed to support the sector, with a view to addressing statutory costs faced by operators that cannot be deferred. Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and they are being waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of €3 million. The NTA has put schemes in place to refund motor tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 and to waive national car test fees for the same period. Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website. The NTA has also waived standard age limits for taxis and hackneys through to the end of 2022, thereby ensuring that no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle. Many of the major costs faced by SPSV operators, such as insurance and dispatch operator fees, can be deferred or cancelled during a period of inactivity. Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero- or low-emission vehicles, we have confirmed that there will be a further reiteration of the current eSPSV grant scheme in 2022, following the allocation of funding for next year as part of the budget 2022 process. There has been an exceptionally high uptake of this grant scheme in 2021. It received a total of 1,488 applications and, at the beginning of November, €8.5 million had been paid to applicants, with the remainder of funding allocated to applicants with current provisional grant offers. In addition, Microfinance Ireland announced in September that loan finance, up to €25,000, is now available to support applicants to the scheme, as many SPSV owners were finding it difficult to secure finance from banks and other commercial lending providers. Further information on this facility is available from Microfinance Ireland.	spk_67
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, met as recently as 25 November with the advisory committee on SPSVs. It was a valuable opportunity for him to get first-hand information on the issues affecting the industry, as well as an initial assessment of the impact of the latest restrictions brought about by the recent public health advice. This committee brings a broad range of stakeholders, including taxi drivers and passengers, together to advise the Minister and the NTA on policy. In the past, taxi representatives have played a constructive role on the committee and many measures taken to date, including the extension of the taxi age limits and the waiver of licence fees, originated as recommendations from the committee. That is an appropriate forum for dealing with issues in the sector but it is important to say a number of measures are still in place, including the refund of NCT and motor tax, the waiver of licence fees at a cost of €6 million, the PUP, where they can earn up to €960 over an eight-week period, and the €1,000 enterprise grant scheme. The Minister will continue to engage with the sector on supports as the pandemic continues, as we are doing across government.	spk_71
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has met with the taxi representatives. They have played a crucial role in the current supports, including the refund of NCT and motor tax and extending the vehicle age. At the start of the pandemic, the industry regulator the National Transport Authority immediately extended age limits for taxis and hackneys and has done so three times. The most recent extension is up to the end of 2022, thus ensuring no vehicle will be forced to exit the fleet due to age limits during the pandemic. These are considerations that the Government is taking on board, noting that one of the huge costs for taxi drivers is the replacement of vehicles, as well as the other measures in place. The Minister will continue to engage and work constructively with the sector, as have the Taoiseach and other Ministers across government. There is a recognition that restrictions are having an impact on this sector and others.	spk_74
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_12	I am taking this on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. I thank the Deputy for her question and the opportunity to update Deputies on the status of my Department's work on the CIÉ regular wages scheme.As many in the House will be aware, the CIÉ Group has two pension schemes, namely, the regular wages scheme, RWS, and the 1951 superannuation scheme, and issues around the schemes are primarily a matter for the trustees of the schemes, the CIÉ Group and its employees. The CIÉ Group is actively engaged in introducing changes to both schemes aimed at rectifying the significant deficit in order to meet the statutory minimum funding standard required by the Pensions Authority.  A ballot of RWS members on a Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, proposal took place in June 2020 and was carried by 83% of those who voted. The proposed changes were agreed by the trustees of the schemes, the employees and the CIÉ Group following extensive and prolonged engagement between all parties. Following this process, CIÉ prepared and submitted draft statutory instruments to my Department to give effect to the proposed amendments, to establish a new defined contribution scheme and to consolidate the existing statutory instruments comprising the main scheme. These changes involve significant amendments that are necessary to address the minimum funding standard requirements. There are a number of steps involved before a statutory instrument can be made, including the statutory consultation process. Further, under the Transport Act 1950, the Minister must consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on any amendments to CIÉ pension schemes. I can advise that this consultation is under way and I expect that the details will be settled shortly.  Once the final details have been settled, we will direct CIÉ to publish the amending schedules or schemes in I would also like to take this opportunity to again reassure the Deputy that officials in my Department, in conjunction with advisors from NewERA, have been working on the draft statutory instruments as expeditiously as possible. In this context, we hope to be in a position to confirm the schemes in early 2022.	spk_78
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_13	The standards for and issuing of driving licences are covered by EU directives, transposed into national law by member states.EU Directive 2006/126/EC on driving licences sets out, among other matters, minimum standards of driving fitness for all drivers, covering medical conditions that affect driving and setting out restrictions on the ability to hold a licence. Member states may, if they choose, apply higher standards in their own jurisdictions. Under Irish law, a person aged 70 or over must provide a medical report from their GP when applying for or renewing a driving licence, regardless of health status. Depending on the report, the applicant may be granted a licence for one or three years. On consideration of the current position, I have accepted a recommendation from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, that the initial age for mandatory medical testing, where an applicant is not otherwise required to supply a medical report, should be increased from 70 to 75. This change will require amendments to the relevant regulations. The regulatory amendments required are being progressed and the estimated date of implementation is currently February 2022. However, this will depend on legal advice and the availability of drafting resources. In Ireland all driving licence applicants must complete a self-declaration on driver fitness. Drivers aged over 70 and those with a specified condition must produce a medical report with their application. The National Office for Transport Medicine wrote to the RSA in January 2019 recommending that the requirement for routine medical certification of drivers over 70 be lifted. However, the authority noted that public perception of mandatory medical testing for older drivers is reasonably favourable, even if it is not supported by available research.  We hope that the new regulation will be in place by February 2022.	spk_35
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_13	I hear the Deputy's concerns about trying to expedite this. The February 2022 date will depend on the legal advice and the availability of drafting resources. I take Deputy Moynihan's point regarding the pressure on GPs at the moment. In order to address the social distancing requirements and the additional burdens on our medical services during the pandemic, the requirement for those over 70 to provide a medical report was temporarily removed in order to protect our citizens and take pressure off our medical services. From March 2020 to June 2021 people aged 70 or over could apply to renew their driver licence without a medical report where they did not have an identified or specified illness. To date, there has been no indication of any negative effects on road safety because of this concession. I take the Deputy's points on board and if I can get more information on that February 2022 timeline, I will revert to him on it.	spk_37
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Driver Licences	dbsect_13	My understanding is that regulatory amendments will be required to progress this. This change will not come into force until those regulations are progressed. That will depend on legal advice and the availability of drafting resources.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Rail Network	dbsect_14	I have no doubt Deputy O'Rourke welcomes the inclusion in the draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, GDA, of a new rail link to Navan as one of its many projects and programmes to be delivered by 2042. I know the issue of a rail link to Navan was one of several that generated a significant number of submissions during the original public consultation held by the NTA in November 2020. The GDA transport strategy is subject to a formal statutory approval process and will ultimately be submitted for ministerial approval in 2022. Therefore, it is not appropriate at this juncture to speak about prioritisation of one particular project over another. As the Deputy is aware, there is a long lead-in time for big projects like this. If it is included in the final strategy, this project will require significant planning and design before it is shovel-ready. As it stands, the draft strategy, which covers all modes of transport and all counties in the GDA, proposes delivery of the Navan rail line in the latter half of the strategy period. On the proposal itself, the background report prepared for the NTA considered again the strategic rationale for such a rail link. It considered rail and bus options, re-examined the potential alignments of a rail link and provided a high-level assessment of cost and demand. While the benefit-to-cost ratio returned by the economic assessment was less than that seen for some other projects, the report concluded there was a strong strategic rationale for the proposal and that is why it has been brought forward for inclusion in the draft strategy. Consultation on the draft strategy is currently open and is running until 17 December. I encourage the Deputy to make the case for the rail link in the final version of the	spk_41

It is due to commence shortly. It is expected that the revised transport strategy will be ready for approval and publication by mid-2022. Alongside the national development plan, NDP, the Department's forthcoming land transport investment framework will put in place a strategic framework to ensure that investment in the transport sector in the coming decades aligns with the overarching Government policies such as spatial targets for 2040. It is a major project that will require significant design and planning. We have to wait for the strategy to be completed first.	spk_43

The current strategy was published in 2016. That extends to 2035. The Act requires that the strategy be reviewed every six years in line with the statutory framework. The NTA's transport strategy for the GDA is under review. This is the process that we have to go through. It is a major project that will involve significant planning and design.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_15	We can all acknowledge that transitioning the haulage sector to low or zero carbon will be more challenging than other road transport sectors given the size and weight of trucks and the distances they travel. Ireland’s HGV fleet is particularly reliant on fossil fuels, specifically diesel. Biofuels will help with the transition. The renewable fuels for transport policy statement which was published last month sets out a future trajectory of increase in biofuels use in land transport in line with climate action plan targets to 2030, as well as a range of measures and incentives for future supply of renewable fuels such as biomethane and green hydrogen. As the initial investment in alternative fuel technology for HGVs is expensive at the moment, the Government is providing incentives to the sector to make the transition. The alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicle purchase grant scheme, which is administered by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, is intended to help to bridge some of the difference in purchase price between conventional heavy-duty vehicles and those powered by alternatively fuelled power-trains. Some €2 million was allocated to this scheme in 2021. Given the excellent response to the initiative, the Department allocated an additional €1 million in funds this year to assist the heavy-duty vehicle sector in its transition to zero-emission mobility. Funds for 2021 have now been fully allocated, but the scheme will continue in 2022 with further funding available. The Department has also commissioned a number of studies to identify actions that haulage operators and companies can take to reduce carbon and other emissions. These include a road freight decarbonisation study co-funded with TII and three research projects with Trinity College Dublin and University College Cork. Collectively, these projects will form a substantial evidence base on which a longer-term decarbonisation strategy can be developed. We are also developing our ten-year haulage strategy, which will be focused on improving efficiencies and standards, and on helping the haulage sector to move to a low-carbon future.	spk_47
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_15	The ten-year haulage strategy is focusing on a number of issues. Reducing emissions in the sector is one issue. The other issues include how we are dealing with the driver shortage and how to make the profession more attractive. There has been the first phase of a public consultation, with further consultation on the draft strategy next year. Between Covid, Brexit and other challenges facing the industry, this is a really good time to get the feedback from the industry on how we can support the sector and the supply chain. We have seen how reliant and flexible it was through the Brexit transition. Our supply chain was robust. They were flexible, as they told us they would be. We were all fearful about the transition on 1 January but the sector has really done us proud. We need to ensure we support it in every way possible. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I met representatives of the IRHA last week to discuss many of these issues.	spk_49
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_15	At our meeting with the IRHA last week, we discussed issues around fuel prices, the decarbonisation of the HGV sector and the HGV driver shortage. The Minister and I agreed at the meeting to consider a proposal from the IRHA to expand the relief available to hauliers under the diesel rebate scheme, but with a link to the phase-out of older, more polluting vehicles and an overall reduction in emissions from the sector. Details of the proposal are to be submitted to the Department for further consideration and we will meet the IRHA again in the new year. It is a sector that is very challenged and needs to be supported. One way is through the alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicles scheme, which is a medium- to long-term solution for the sector as new technologies come on board. In the meantime, the sector does need our support. I have engaged with it a great deal over the last 12 months since I came into this role and that is something I will continue to do along with the Minister.	spk_51
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_16	In March 2021 the Minister and I were delighted to launch the safe routes to school, SRTS, programme which will support active travel infrastructure for selected schools around the country. The programme aims to support walking, scooting and cycling to primary and post-primary schools and to create safer walking and cycling routes within communities. This will help alleviate congestion at school gates and increase the number of students who walk or cycle to school by providing the necessary infrastructure. All schools were eligible to apply to the programme and information was circulated from the Departments of Education and Transport to schools nationwide. By the deadline of 16 April, 931 applications had been received from schools in every county in Ireland. Following that, 170 schools were notified on 21 June that they have been selected for inclusion in the first round of the safe routes to school programme, including eight schools in Limerick and two schools in Tipperary. Funding of €15 million has been allocated for projects at the 170 schools included in round 1. The subsequent schools will be engaged with on a rolling basis in each local authority area. This funding is being provided from the €1.8 billion funding earmarked in the programme for Government to support sustainable transport. It is important to note that all active travel funding looks to improve links to schools where possible, not only the safe routes to school programme. The required investment at each school will be dependent on the changes required in each particular case. As most interventions at or near applicable schools will take time to implement, especially if they require planning permission, the €15 million budget will extend beyond 2022. The budget for the cycle parking element of the safe routes to school programme in 2022 will be €3 million. The schools selected were assessed against a range of criteria including school type, location and the school’s commitment to sustainable travel. Schools that have applied this year and that have not been included in the first round of funding will not be required to reapply as they will be included on a rolling basis. Thus, we will get through the first 170 and then it will be rolling after that. Hence there are no plans for an additional call for schools to join the programme.	spk_53

They are Gaelscoil Sáirséal, St. Nessan’s National School, Scoil Íde, St. Paul's National School, Laurel Hill Coláiste FCJ, An Mhodhscoil, Limerick School Project National School and St. Munchin's College in Corbally. In Tipperary they were Gaelscoil Chluain Meala and Loreto Secondary School. It is important to note the other 29 schools in Limerick and the 22 in Tipperary that have applied this year but have not been included in the first round of funding will not be required to reapply. They will come into the programme on this rolling basis. There are different stages. Once a school is completed the local authority moves on to the next schools that have been successful as part of the roll-out to the first 170. It is also important to say safe routes to school programme funding is only one part of the active travel programme. Schools can work directly with local authorities around other active travel projects outside the programme. As the Deputy knows, we have €360 million funding per year for walking and cycling infrastructure that local authorities can tap into also, within towns and villages.	spk_55

The infrastructure officers have now met the majority of round 1 schools to discuss the situation outside those schools, any new information on school locations etc. and possible solutions. In addition, the work that has been undertaken includes a survey of all the schools, parental surveys, front of school audits and walking and cycling audits that are being carried out to assess the existing pedestrian and cycling infrastructure within 500 m of a school. This information is going to inform the process so it is being captured as well. Speed surveys are also being carried out to assess the existing speed outside schools. These data will then help inform the delivery plans and further engage with the school population. The NTA and safe routes to school teams have produced a draft safe routes to school design guide to assist the local authorities to provide the technical guidance. The infrastructure officers are holding weekly meetings with the active travel engineers to update on the safe routes to school programme in Limerick. There are on-site visits to schools, except for Scoil Íde and St. Munchin's College, with executive engineers to discuss the possible measures. Tipperary is holding its discussions. It has weekly meetings in relation to schools in Clonmel. With the roll-out of the resources to the local authorities, we will be monitoring this to ensure these 170 are progressed as quickly as possible.

Government support for all public transport services in 2020 amounted to €620 million. For 2021, more than €670 million has been provided in public service obligation, PSO, funding in order to ensure the existing level of public transport services, albeit at a higher cost, continue to operate in a safe manner. By comparison, the level of PSO and Local Link funding provided in 2019 was in the region of €300 million. I know of the Deputy's deep interest in the development of public transport services generally and more specifically in respect of the two areas she mentioned. I am advised by the NTA that, in addition to rail services from Laytown, commuter services are provided from Bettystown and Laytown by Matthews Coaches. These are commercial services and are licensed by the NTA. The NTA has no role in the setting of fares for commercial services. On bus services, the NTA has indicated that Bettystown and Laytown are considered suburbs of Drogheda when planning their public transport services. Routes D1 and D2 provide four bus services linking both centres to Laytown station to the south and the town of Drogheda to the north west.	spk_59
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_17	As the Deputy knows, Laytown station is outside the short hop zone, which goes north as far as Balbriggan. Such stations have fares that are not well suited for the pay-as-you-go service provided by the Transport for Ireland, TFI, Leap card because cardholders would need to maintain a high minimum balance on their Leap cards before they could use them. The best fare for such intercity services is typically obtained by booking in advance, which again is not suited to the TFI Leap card. The NTA is actively investigating alternative ticketing solutions that would be better suited to intercity rail services as part of a next-generation ticketing initiative. The NTA has adjusted a number of fares in order to mitigate the fares charged at the outside edge of the short hop zone. A number of tickets between Gormanston, Laytown and Dublin have either remained at the same price level or seen a reduction since 2018. The NTA is actively engaged on the development of a very flexible TaxSaver ticketing product suitable for occasional use in response to the change in public transport use as a result of Covid-19. It is hopeful of bringing something forward early next year.	spk_61

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic Supports	dbsect_18	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 33 and 48 together. I recognise that the SPSV industry has been badly affected during the Covid-19 pandemic that, for an extended period, brought about an almost complete collapse in passenger demand for taxi and other SPSV services. While recent months saw a welcome return of demand, with the NTA reporting 86% of drivers back at work in October, the recent increase in infection rates has given rise to the necessary reintroduction of a number of restrictions. Conscious of the potential impact of such restrictions on affected sectors and society in general, particularly as we approach what is traditionally a busy period around Christmas, the Government has sought to ensure that any restrictions are targeted and appropriate. It is continuing to monitor the situation closely as it develops. In the meantime, I confirm that the vast majority of measures that we have taken to support the taxi industry from the start of the pandemic remain in place. I understand that as many as 70% of SPSV drivers availed of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, at the height of the pandemic. As the Deputy may be aware, the PUP reopened for a limited period to support people who lose their employment as a result of Covid restrictions from Tuesday, 7 December. Self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to €960 in any given eight-week period, net of expenses. Drivers coming off the PUP can avail of the Covid-19 enterprise support grant, worth €1,000, which will meet the costs associated with returning to work and that will remain in place for the rest of the year for self-employed people who close their PUP claim. Taxi drivers can use this grant for the purchase of personal protective equipment, protective screens and cleaning materials. The employment wage subsidy scheme, which provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of eligible employees on the employer’s payroll and gross pay to employees, is now expected to continue until 30 April 2022. In addition, support for SPSV operators continues to be available, both now and into 2022, through a series of specific measures designed to support the sector, with a view to addressing statutory costs faced by operators that cannot be deferred. Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and they are being waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of €3 million. The NTA has put schemes in place to refund motor tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 and to waive national car test fees for the same period. Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website. The NTA has also waived standard age limits for taxis and hackneys through to the end of 2022, thereby ensuring that no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle. Many of the major costs faced by SPSV operators, such as insurance and dispatch operator fees, can be deferred or cancelled during a period of inactivity. Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero- or low-emission vehicles, we have confirmed that there will be a further reiteration of the current eSPSV grant scheme in 2022, following the allocation of funding for next year as part of the budget 2022 process. There has been an exceptionally high uptake of this grant scheme in 2021. It received a total of 1,488 applications and, at the beginning of November, €8.5 million had been paid to applicants, with the remainder of funding allocated to applicants with current provisional grant offers. In addition, Microfinance Ireland announced in September that loan finance, up to €25,000, is now available to support applicants to the scheme, as many SPSV owners were finding it difficult to secure finance from banks and other commercial lending providers. Further information on this facility is available from Microfinance Ireland.	spk_67
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic Supports	dbsect_18	The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, met as recently as 25 November with the advisory committee on SPSVs. It was a valuable opportunity for him to get first-hand information on the issues affecting the industry, as well as an initial assessment of the impact of the latest restrictions brought about by the recent public health advice. This committee brings a broad range of stakeholders, including taxi drivers and passengers, together to advise the Minister and the NTA on policy. In the past, taxi representatives have played a constructive role on the committee and many measures taken to date, including the extension of the taxi age limits and the waiver of licence fees, originated as recommendations from the committee. That is an appropriate forum for dealing with issues in the sector but it is important to say a number of measures are still in place, including the refund of NCT and motor tax, the waiver of licence fees at a cost of €6 million, the PUP, where they can earn up to €960 over an eight-week period, and the €1,000 enterprise grant scheme. The Minister will continue to engage with the sector on supports as the pandemic continues, as we are doing across government.	spk_71
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic Supports	dbsect_18	The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has met with the taxi representatives. They have played a crucial role in the current supports, including the refund of NCT and motor tax and extending the vehicle age. At the start of the pandemic, the industry regulator the National Transport Authority immediately extended age limits for taxis and hackneys and has done so three times. The most recent extension is up to the end of 2022, thus ensuring no vehicle will be forced to exit the fleet due to age limits during the pandemic. These are considerations that the Government is taking on board, noting that one of the huge costs for taxi drivers is the replacement of vehicles, as well as the other measures in place. The Minister will continue to engage and work constructively with the sector, as have the Taoiseach and other Ministers across government. There is a recognition that restrictions are having an impact on this sector and others.	spk_74
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-16	dail	33	Pension Provisions	dbsect_19	I am taking this on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. I thank the Deputy for her question and the opportunity to update Deputies on the status of my Department's work on the CIÉ regular wages scheme.As many in the House will be aware, the CIÉ Group has two pension schemes, namely, the regular wages scheme, RWS, and the 1951 superannuation scheme, and issues around the schemes are primarily a matter for the trustees of the schemes, the CIÉ Group and its employees. The CIÉ Group is actively engaged in introducing changes to both schemes aimed at rectifying the significant deficit in order to meet the statutory minimum funding standard required by the Pensions Authority.  A ballot of RWS members on a Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, proposal took place in June 2020 and was carried by 83% of those who voted. The proposed changes were agreed by the trustees of the schemes, the employees and the CIÉ Group following extensive and prolonged engagement between all parties. Following this process, CIÉ prepared and submitted draft statutory instruments to my Department to give effect to the proposed amendments, to establish a new defined contribution scheme and to consolidate the existing statutory instruments comprising the main scheme. These changes involve significant amendments that are necessary to address the minimum funding standard requirements. There are a number of steps involved before a statutory instrument can be made, including the statutory consultation process. Further, under the Transport Act 1950, the Minister must consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on any amendments to CIÉ pension schemes. I can advise that this consultation is under way and I expect that the details will be settled shortly.  Once the final details have been settled, we will direct CIÉ to publish the amending schedules or schemes in I would also like to take this opportunity to again reassure the Deputy that officials in my Department, in conjunction with advisors from NewERA, have been working on the draft statutory instruments as expeditiously as possible. In this context, we hope to be in a position to confirm the schemes in early 2022.	spk_78
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-07	dail	33	EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Motion	dbsect_17	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:Proposal for a Council Decision on the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union in the Partnership Council established by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the other part, regarding the extension of the interim period referred to in Article 552(11) of that Agreement during which the United Kingdom may derogate from the obligation to delete Passenger Name Record data of passengers after their departure from the United Kingdom,a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 2nd December, 2021.I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice on a motion referring to a draft proposal by the Council of the European Union to facilitate exchange of passenger name records, PNR, data under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, with the United Kingdom. PNR data is information provided by passengers during the reservation and booking of tickets and when checking in on flights. The content of PNR data varies depending on the information given by the passenger and may include, for example, dates of travel, travel itinerary and contact details such as address and phone number. The exchange of this information is to assist in the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. The exchange of this data is an essential tool for law enforcement, including countering terrorist threats across the EU and, of course, is of particular value to law enforcement co-operation between Ireland and the UK. Deputies will be aware that if Ireland wishes to take part in an EU measure with a legal basis that falls under Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, TFEU, Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution is required. The Council intends to adopt this measure by 20 December 2021 at the latest, therefore, it is necessary to secure Oireachtas approval as a matter of urgency and, in light of this, I ask Deputies to pass this motion without a vote. The proposal provides for an extension of the special arrangements currently in place in the TCA to allow the continued sharing of PNR data with the UK, which in the absence of a decision to extend will expire at the end of this year, that is, on 31 December 2021. The extension will allow the existing special arrangements to continue to run until the end of 2022. It is worth noting that this measure makes no policy changes in this area. As the extension needs to be in place by the end of the year, the latest it can be adopted at the EU Council is 20 December 2021. Regretfully, this has put us under pressure to complete the opt-in process as soon as possible. However, as I mentioned, I assure Deputies that the measure is purely technical in nature and does not introduce or amend any policy matters. In essence, it provides for a continuation of existing arrangements until the end of 2022. The Government sincerely regrets the lack of time given to the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider this matter, which was not within the Government's control. Unfortunately, the European Commission was unable to produce the draft proposal earlier than 26 November due to the requirement for internal consultations. I trust that Deputies understand the urgency and necessity of this motion passing today. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK includes arrangements for exchanges of PNR and the protection of such data shared by EU airline carriers to the UK. An essential precondition for the arrangements as set out in the TCA is that the UK applies data protection standards essentially equivalent to those set out in the EU's standards and complies with specific additional data protection standards. While EU member states can retain PNR data for a period of five years, the TCA imposes a requirement on the UK to delete PNR data after one year. This is due to the change in the UK's status from EU member state to a third country. The UK's PNR data processing systems were originally configured to comply with the requirements of EU law. As such, their technical systems, including for the deletion of PNR data, operate in exactly the same way as the systems operated by EU member states. However, the UK currently has no mechanism to operate an automated risk assessment process or to delete PNR data automatically other than upon expiry of a period of five years beginning with the date of transfer. As such, the UK's system for processing PNR data remains configured as it was prior to the UK leaving the European Union. However, intensive work is ongoing by the UK to ensure the necessary technical adjustments are being made to guarantee its compliance with the requirements of the TCA. In the meantime, the UK is operating additional interim period safeguards manually. This includes operating a manual risk assessment process and manually logging and putting beyond use PNR data that should be considered as deleted. Due to these circumstances, Article 552 of the TCA provides for a derogation to this requirement to enable the UK to adapt its systems to ensure compliance. This derogation ends in December 2021. The TCA allows for two such yearly extensions until the end of 2023. The UK has informed the Commission that work is continuing on their systems to facilitate this. It is now in the process of redeveloping its technical systems for processing PNR data to meet the requirements of the TCA and it has requested an extension to the derogation. Consequently, the Commission has published this proposal in order to facilitate an extension of this special arrangement up to 31 December 2022, thus allowing the continued sharing of PNR data with the UK. It should be noted that Article 552(11) of the TCA sets out additional safeguards the UK must follow during the derogation period. In conjunction with the request from the UK, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office carried out an independent review of the safeguards provided for in Article 552(11) of the TCA and confirmed that it is satisfied that the safeguards are in place and are operating as set out in the UK report. Without the extension of the derogation period, PNR data will cease to be shared between the EU and the UK from midnight on 31 December 2021. As Deputies will understand, if this were to happen it is something that could potentially have serious repercussions in the fight against terrorism and could impact on the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases. As mentioned earlier, the proposal presented by the Commission includes the use of the legal bases of Article 87(2)(a), making this a measure under Title V of the TFEU. Thus, Protocol 21 applies and Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution is required for Ireland to opt into the measure. The views of the Office of the Attorney General were sought and the legal advice received has confirmed that Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution is required. To conclude, I emphasise that effective implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is an EU priority and Ireland will play its full part in that. Ireland's role in the EU has changed in recent times and will continue to evolve in the coming years. Full implementation of the TCA is necessary for us not only to play our part as an EU member state, but to ensure that our post-Brexit relationship with the UK continues to grow and develop. Part of this relationship is ensuring that the safety and security of our citizens is protected and this measure is necessary to do that. I trust that the House can support the exercise of Ireland's opt-in in respect of this measure. Ongoing exchange of PNR information with the UK is something that is entirely within Ireland's strategic interest. I thank Deputies for their consideration of this important matter.	spk_226
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-12-07	dail	33	EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Motion	dbsect_17	I thank Deputies for their contributions. I will have the Minister come back to Deputy Catherine Murphy on the question she posed. As I mentioned earlier, this measure is essential to ensure continued close law enforcement co-operation between the EU and the UK. It is vital we meet the highest standards possible when it comes to the investigation and prosecution of crimes, and the ongoing transfer of PNR data helps to ensure that. This extension of the special arrangements in place in the TCA will allow the continued sharing of such data with the UK which, in the absence of a decision to extend, will expire at the end of 2021. The extension will run until the end of 2022. The continuation of these special arrangements to facilitate ongoing exchange of PNR information with the UK is the key to co-operation between the EU and the UK on law enforcement. I commend this motion to the House. On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank all Deputies for attending today.	spk_230
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-24	dail	33	Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_17	"I move: “That the Bill be now read a Second Time.”I am pleased to introduce the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) (Amendment) Bill 2021 for the consideration of this House. The primary objective and focus of the Bill is to amend the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 to facilitate a revised board composition for the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, and, through other necessary operational and technical revisions, to support the functioning of the MCIB as the investigative body in the State in relation to marine casualties, to meet our European and international obligations and to have an independent marine casualty investigative body in place. Marine accident investigation is an important element of national safety policy going back many years. The Merchant Shipping Act 1894 provided the first legislative framework until it was replaced by the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000, which provided for the establishment of the MCIB. In accordance with the Department of Transport’s statement of strategy 2021-2023, the promotion and enhancement of safety is a key objective and priority and underscores many of our policies, strategies and actions. Following on from this, one of the core objectives of the Irish maritime directorate strategy 2021-2025 is to enhance maritime safety. Bearing this in mind, while there is an immediate and urgent need to progress the current Bill, this Bill is not the final step in the process of reviewing the legislative and structural framework that applies to marine casualty investigation in Ireland.I would like to take this opportunity to mention that an independent review of the organisational structures for marine casualty investigation in this country was initiated in March of this year to be carried out by Clinchmaritime Limited. The key objective of the review was to assess the current organisational structures for marine casualty investigation and to set out in a report any recommendations, including in relation to change, to achieve the most appropriate and effective marine casualty investigation structures for Ireland, taking into account national, EU and international obligations. The review report has been received and is currently being examined. The recommendations contained in the report will be given full consideration with the view to developing a plan of response, which may include the delivery of further legislation and will include further engagement with the Oireachtas committee.  As I will now explain in more detail, this Bill is a necessary intermediary step to amend the existing legislative framework for the MCIB to ensure and support the continued functioning of the investigative body in the immediate term. To assist Deputies and to provide some context to the current Bill, I would like to give a brief background to the establishment and role of the MCIB and the events over the last two years that have given rise to the need for this legislative change. The MCIB was established under the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 to investigate marine casualties and publish reports of such investigations. Under the 2000 Act, the MCIB is mandated to examine and, if necessary, carry out investigations into all types of marine casualties to, or on board, Irish registered vessels worldwide and other vessels in Irish territorial waters and inland waterways. This includes commercial cargo and passenger shipping, licensed fishing vessels and recreational and leisure craft. Section 8 of the 2000 Act provides for the independence of the board, while section 9 provides for a five-person board comprising three persons appointed by the Minister for Transport, the chief surveyor of the Department of Transport and the Secretary General of the Department, or his or her nominee.  The MCIB is also designated as the investigative body in the State for the purposes of EU Directive 2009/18/EC of 23 April 2009, which established the fundamental principles governing the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector. The directive applies since 2011 to a subset of the marine casualties that come within the remit of the MCIB. The purpose of an investigation is to establish the cause or causes of a marine casualty, with a view to making recommendations for the avoidance of similar marine casualties. It is not the purpose of an investigation to attribute blame or fault. The MCIB is a non-prosecutorial body which does not enforce laws or carry out prosecutions arising from the findings of its investigations.  In March 2019, the EU Commission lodged a case with the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, expressing concern at the independence of the MCIB in the context of the independence requirements of Article 8.1 of Directive 2009/18/EC with particular regard to the membership of two officers of the Department of Transport, namely, the chief surveyor and a nominee of the Secretary General on the board. On 9 July 2020 the CJEU issued a judgment concerning the independence of the MCIB insofar as its investigative work falls within the scope of Directive 2009/18/EC. The court declared that by failing to provide for an investigative body which is independent in its organisation and decision-making of any party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to that investigative body, Ireland has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 8.1 of Directive 2009/18/EC. The issue was the presence of two departmental officials on the board, who were seen as persons whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to the MCIB. There was no finding of wrongdoing on the part of any members of the board. The State addressed the court findings through the resignation of the two board members from the board on 30 July 2020 and the introduction of amending regulations under the European Communities Act 1972, to confirm that the two members are no longer board members for the purpose of investigations that fall within the scope of the directive.  However, while these actions address the CJEU ruling from an EU perspective, separate legislative revisions are required at a national level for a number of important reasons. The first is to facilitate the appointment of new members to the MCIB to fill the existing vacancies on the board. The second is to remove risks associated with the current reduced board membership of only three persons and to ensure that the board can continue to meet the quorum requirements of the 2000 Act, which stipulates a quorum of three members for a meeting of the board. The third is on grounds of consistency to encompass the broader spectrum of investigations that come within the remit of the MCIB under the 2000 Act and the fourth is to ensure that the board can continue to function to meet our EU and international obligations to have an independent marine casualty investigative body in place. The Bill that I present to the House today will address these issues.  I now wish to look at the content of the Bill, which consists of 16 sections. As already outlined, the main focus is to facilitate a revised board composition for the MCIB and the appointment of new board members. The Bill also provides for other necessary operational and technical revisions to the 2000 Act to support the ongoing independent functioning of the MCIB. The opportunity has also been taken in the Bill to update the definition of “safety convention” in the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Act 1952, which relates to the International Maritime Organization's International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS. This is being done to facilitate the transposition of some convention amendments since December 2014 into Irish secondary legislation.  Section 1 of the Bill is the interpretation section. It provides for a definition of the Act of 2000, that is, the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000, No. 14 of 2000, which is the focus of the amendments set out in sections 2 to 12, inclusive, of the Bill. As already mentioned, the 2000 Act is the Act that underpins the establishment and the operation of the MCIB. Section 2 removes the definition of “chief surveyor” from the interpretation section of the 2000 Act as it is no longer required because the chief surveyor is no longer a member of the board of the MCIB.  Section 3 is one of the most important sections of the Bill, as it amends section 9 of the 2009 Act, which relates to the composition of the board of the MCIB. The section provides for a substitution of section 9 of the 2000 Act to provide for a new composition of the board of the MCIB based on a minimum of five members and a maximum of seven members appointed by the Minister for Transport. References to the chief surveyor and the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, or his or her nominee as members of the board, have been removed. The section facilitates the appointment of new board members and provides some flexibility on the total number of members in recognition of the limited pool of persons with appropriate maritime or other expertise who may be interested in putting themselves forward for consideration as a member of the board. However, mindful of the CJEU judgment, the section precludes serving officers of the Department of Transport or certain officers or special advisers to Ministers or Ministers of State who held a position in the Department in a previous five-year period from being eligible for appointment as a member of the board.  Section 3 also sets out a framework of desired skill sets for potential board members in the interest of maintaining knowledge and expertise on the board. The list is not exhaustive but includes knowledge, experience and expertise in such matters as accident investigation, corporate governance and management, marine engineering, nautical science or navigation, naval architecture, maritime law and regulation, health and safety management and risk management. The possibility of increased membership will facilitate the addition of further expertise on the board. The revised section introduces a specific consideration of board gender balance when the Minister of Transport is appointing members of the board. This is in line with the Government's commitment to achieve gender balance on State boards and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  Section 4 amends the tenure of office provisions in section 10 of the 2000 Act that apply to board members and removes the age threshold for members. The chairperson and members of the board may be appointed for an initial period not exceeding five years and may be reappointed for a second term. In accordance with the updated code of practice for the governance of State bodies, membership of the board will be limited to two terms of appointment.  Section 5 is a minor technical amendment to section 11 of the 2000 Act to adjust a cross reference in the section arising from the revised construction of section 9 of the 2000 Act under section 3 of the Bill.  Section 6 amends section 14 of the 2000 Act, which relates to the quorum for a meeting of the board and vacancies on the board. The amended section clarifies the possible composition of the three-person quorum, including when the chairperson and deputy chairperson are not in attendance at a meeting or are required to withdraw at the same time due to conflict of interest issues. As in other sections of the Bill, some consequential amendments to section 14 are provided for, arising from section 3 of the Bill and the revised composition of the board.  Section 7 expands the scope of section 16 of the 2000 Act relating to consultants, advisers and investigators to facilitate the engagement of additional expertise by the board to assist it in the performance of its functions under the Act. All references to investigators nominated by the chief surveyor from the Marine Survey Office, MSO, have been removed from the section to confirm the current situation where no Marine Survey Office personnel are involved in investigating marine casualties on behalf of the MCIB. Investigations are conducted by investigators from a panel established by the MCIB. Section 8 is a consequential amendment and amends section 17 of the 2000 Act to apply the disclosure of interests requirements of that section to any other provider of skills or expertise engaged by the board under the amended section 16 of that Act. Section 9 amends section 18 of the 2000 Act to bring a greater consistency between the provisions of the 2000 Act and the regulatory regime that applies to marine investigations that fall within the scope of EU Directive 2009/18/EC, which governs the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector, with regard to confidentiality and the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information. Section 10 provides for an important specific requirement for persons who are involved in or aware of a marine casualty to notify the MCIB of information regarding the marine casualty through an amendment of section 23 of the 2000 Act, which deals with the initial notification of marine casualties. Mindful of the CJEU judgment and the independence of the MCIB, section 11 amends section 26 of the 2000 Act in relation to investigations, to remove the requirement to consult with the Minister for Transport when the board decides to investigate a casualty that falls within section 26(1)( Section 12 amends section 34 of the 2000 Act to bring a consistency between the timeframe for the publication of investigation reports by the board under the 2000 Act and those that fall within the scope of Directive 2009/18/EC. The amendment provides that the board will endeavour to publish an investigation report within 12 months of the occurrence of the marine casualty rather than within nine months of the notification of the casualty. At least one interim report within 12 months of the occurrence of a marine casualty will be required if the board is not in a position to publish a final report within that 12-month period. Section 13 is not an amendment to the 2000 Act. It is a new, stand-alone provision in the Bill that will require persons to notify the Marine Survey Office when a marine casualty within the meaning of the 2000 Act occurs. This is an important provision and recognises the fact that the Marine Survey Office continues to have an interest in knowing about marine casualties, in particular where there may be implications for the safety of vessels, crew, passengers or the environment, and where there are regulatory compliance issues that need to be addressed or followed up. To reflect the provisions of section 1(4) of the 2000 Act, the requirements of the section do not apply to vessels of the Naval Service of the Defence Forces. Warships of another state are also excluded, in order to be consistent with the application of Directive 2009/18/EC. The offence provisions in the section are in line with those that apply to similar offences under the 2000 Act. Section 14 is a transitional provision to confirm the continuation and completion of any MCIB investigations that may have been commenced and have not been completed on the date of the enactment of the Bill. To remove any doubt, the section also confirms the continued appointment of the three remaining members of the existing board for the unexpired term of their appointments under the 2000 Act. Section 15 provides for an amendment of section 3(1) of the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Act 1952 to substitute and update the definition of ""safety convention"" in that Act. The definition was last updated in 2014. This will facilitate the transposition into Irish secondary legislation of some recent amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, the SOLAS convention, that have been adopted up to and including the 99th session of the maritime safety committee of the International Maritime Organization in May 2018. The SOLAS convention is an important international convention concerning the safety of merchant ships. The main objective of the convention is to specify minimum safety standards for the construction, equipment and operation of ships. The convention has been updated and amended on numerous occasions and is subject to change on a continuous and almost annual basis by the International Maritime Organization, thus necessitating periodic updating of the enabling provisions in Irish primary legislation. Section 16 is a standard legislative provision providing for the Short Title, collective citation and construction of the Bill. As indicated at the outset, the primary aim in presenting this Bill for the consideration of the House is to amend the existing legislative framework that relates to the MCIB in order to ensure the continued functioning of the board as the maritime investigative body in the State, by facilitating the filling of vacancies on the board and the appointment of additional board members, and thereby removing the current risks associated with a reduced board membership. The proposals contained in the Bill will enhance the organisational independence of the MCIB in carrying out its important role in investigating marine casualties, establishing the cause or causes of those casualties and making safety recommendations for the avoidance of similar incidents in the future. I commend the Bill to the House."	spk_229
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-24	dail	33	Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_17	I thank Deputies for their comments on the Bill. I welcome the engagement on it and the underlying support for an enhanced legislative framework for the investigation of marine casualties in Ireland. Although a relatively short Bill of only 16 sections, it contains important provisions to amend and update the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 and thereby to support the continued independent functioning of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board as the marine investigative body in the State. This is needed, not only in order that we will continue to meet our international and EU obligations to have an independent investigative body in place, but also to ensure the MCIB can continue to carry out its investigative role, establishing the causes of marine casualties and making safety recommendations with the aim of preventing similar casualties occurring in the future. It is also consistent with one of the core objectives of the Irish Maritime Directorate Strategy 2021-2025 to enhance maritime safety and is an important pillar of our national safety policy. I am confident the Bill will provide a suitable baseline for the future development of marine casualty investigation structures in Ireland. As mentioned in the opening statement on the Bill, there is an urgent need for it to progress. As a consequence of the necessary actions taken to address the findings of the July 2020 CJEU judgment, the MCIB board is currently composed of three members and the existing 2000 Act does not provide a mechanism to fill the vacancies on the board. The Bill will allow the filling of the vacancies to be progressed. It will facilitate a revised board composition and the appointment of new board members, thus removing the risks associated with a reduced board membership and ensuring quorum requirements for board meetings can be met. It will also ensure there is a specific legislative requirement in the 2000 Act for a marine casualty to be notified to the MCIB directly. The report of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill noted the importance of the Bill. The committee agreed that the current situation of the quorum for board meetings poses a risk to the functioning of the MCIB and that section 3 of the Bill, which provides for the appointment of an increased number of board members with specific relevant competences and expertise, should ensure the board functions in the short term, while the Department carries out the comprehensive review of the broader framework for marine casualty investigation. The underlying focus of the operational and technical amendments to the 2000 Act contained in the Bill is to support the functioning of the MCIB.The opportunity offered by this Bill's introduction has been taken to update the legislative provisions relating to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS, with a view to providing an enabling framework for the transposition of more recent amendments to the international convention into Irish law. There is an ongoing need for such updates in maritime primary legislation. I am pleased that the Bill affords us this opportunity. I would like to address some of the main themes of the debate. Deputies O'Rourke, Mac Lochlainn, Cathal Crowe, Martin Kenny and others raised the issue of the review report and the wider review of organisational structures for marine casualty investigation in Ireland and the publication of the Clinchmaritime Limited report on the matter. In March 2021, Clinchmaritime Limited was asked to assess the current organisational structures and set out any recommendations, including related to change, to achieve the most appropriate and effective marine casualty investigation structures for Ireland, taking into account national, EU and international obligations. A public consultation on the matter was also carried out between late March and mid-May of 2021. All submissions received were forwarded to Clinchmaritime Limited in order to form input into the review. The contents of the report from Clinchmaritime Limited are being considered in my Department, and officials continue to engage with the Office of the Attorney General to obtain legal advice on certain aspects of the report. This advice will inform the publication of the report. It is therefore not possible to comment further on the report or its publication at this stage. It is envisaged that policy proposals to address recommendations from the overall review process will be developed. As indicated previously, this may lead to proposals for further legislative change. This Bill is the start of a process but it is an urgent and necessary first step. A number of Deputies raised the issue of funding for the MCIB. It is funded by the Department of Transport's Vote, with money voted by the Oireachtas. In recent years, €402,000 has been allocated but the full amount has not been drawn down by the MCIB. Given the nature of the work of the MCIB, funding requirements can vary from year to year. All funding requests from the board to carry out its work programme have been met. In the context of the general review of the organisational structures relating to marine casualty investigation in Ireland, the funding structures and requirements of the marine casualty investigation body may be subject to revision in the future. The existing board comprises highly qualified and experienced individuals. The members have extensive, wide-ranging experience, including in litigation, regulatory law, marine engineering, and accident investigation. Deputies Berry and McNamara raised the issue of new board members and how they will be found in the interim. In normal circumstances, the standard system for board appointments uses the Public Appointments Service and an advertising campaign on its website to fill vacancies on the board. It is open to suitably qualified persons to apply for consideration for appointment. If the Bill is enacted, there would be an immediate need to fill board vacancies and, in particular, to ensure that the quorum requirements for board meetings are met. Section 9 of the Act provides the Minister with power to appoint members, which may be utilised to ensure the continued functioning of a marine casualty investigation body in Ireland. Section 3 of the Bill sets out an amendment to section 9 of the Act relating to the knowledge and experience required for consideration as an appointee to the board,  Notwithstanding the normal practice for the appointment of persons to State bodies as outlined above, the ultimate power to make MCIB appointments rests with the Minister for Transport under the provisions of the 2000 Act. The ministerial power overrides any conflict with the requirements of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies of 2016, and could be used in the event that the Minister needs to quickly and decisively make an urgent appointment to ensure that the MCIB continues to operate and to meet its statutory mandate. It must be noted, however, that it is intended to utilise the expert experience of the Public Appointments Service to fill all board vacancies that arise routinely. Deputy Catherine Murphy raised an issue in respect of the CJEU. In any scenario such as this, serious consideration has to be given to a legal strategy that weighs up all the appropriate factors with legal advice. There is never any certainty with legal proceedings. There was an arguable case in response to the proceedings taken by the Commission. At the time, the decision to defend was an appropriate and reasonable course of action. All key decisions relating to the MCIB infringement case were made following receipt of legal advice and with the approval of the Attorney General and the Minister for the final decision to defend the case at the CJEU. Deputy McNamara and others raised the issue of the cost of the CJEU defence. There were no immediate costs or fines for Ireland arising from the CJEU judgment of 9 July 2020. Fines were not imposed as a consequence of the judgment, since the proceedings were brought under Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The general principle is that the party that loses a case bears the cost. However, the practice in these cases is that neither the European Commission nor the member state, which is Ireland in this instance, ever actually seek their costs. It is therefore a notional concept. Costs related to the defence of the case arose from the preparation and receipt of counsel opinion at each stage of the process and from meetings and consultations with counsel. These costs are met by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. The Office of the Chief State Solicitor does not bill Departments for its services, so the only costs that can be quantified are those paid to counsel. Other costs arising from the involvement of the Department of Transport, the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor's staff in the case were met as part of the normal salary costs of individual staff members. While I have the opportunity, I want to clarify some issues regarding the CJEU judgment. The specific finding of the judgment related to the presence of two Department of Transport officials on the five-person board of the MCIB, who were seen as persons whose interests could conflict with a task entrusted to the MCIB. There was no claim by the Commission that the MCIB lacked independence with regard to its legal structure and there was no court finding of partiality or wrongdoing by any member of the board. Notwithstanding suggestions to the contrary from some quarters, the CJEU judgment contains no adverse findings regarding the competence of the MCIB or of individual members and this issue has not formed part of any interactions between the European Commission and my Department, either before or since the court case. Deputy Catherine Murphy raised allegations made regarding certain board members. This is a matter for An Garda Síochána. I am advised that An Garda Síochána wrote to the chair of the MCIB on 21 June 2021 to confirm that a thorough examination of certain allegations made had been conducted and that no criminality was identified. The matter has been closed by An Garda Síochána. I reassure Deputies that a comprehensive framework and programme are in place within the Department of Transport to oversee and review the legislative structures that apply to the maritime area. This includes a detailed legislative programme document, which is reviewed and updated regularly, having regard to developments at an EU and international level, as well as domestic requirements, priorities and available resources. The extensive maritime legislative programme addresses issues relating to merchant shipping, fishing, passenger vessels and recreational craft, as well as maritime safety and marine environment ship-source pollution prevention. Consolidation and review of the Merchant Shipping Acts has been an important goal of the Irish maritime directorate. As part of the current process, my Department has engaged with the Law Reform Commission, and received specific training on its software to enable officials to directly prepare consolidated texts of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Act 1952 and the Merchant Shipping Act 1992. These texts have been finalised by the Department, reviewed by the Law Reform Commission, and published on the Law Reform Commission's website in 2021. I must clarify that the Lacey report of 2010 was not a report about the independence of the MCIB. The terms of reference asked that the then air, marine, and rail accident investigation legislation be examined, with a view to providing a report to the then Minister for Transport on legislative proposals on the possible amalgamation of the three existing units into a single office, a national multimodal accident investigation office. In the context of looking at wider structural issues as part of the review of marine casualty investigations in Ireland, this matter may well be considered. I reiterate that this Bill is a necessary step to amend the legislative framework surrounding the MCIB and to support the continued functioning of the marine investigative body in the immediate term. I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on the Bill and I look forward to further interaction on this important legislation on Committee Stage.	spk_247

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-17	dail	33	Air Accident Investigation Unit Final Report into R116 air accident: Statements	dbsect_22	The R116 accident was a tragedy that claimed the lives of four crew who dedicated their lives to saving others. I express my sympathies to the families and loved ones of pilot Dara Fitzpatrick, co-pilot Mark Duffy, winchman Ciarán Smyth and winch operator Paul Ormsby. I thank Members for their contributions. It is clear that we all share a common goal of seeking to prevent similar accidents occurring in the future. I thank the chief inspector of the Air Accident Investigation Unit and his team for completing such a comprehensive report. The work they have done will greatly enhance the safety of search and rescue aviation operations in Ireland and internationally. I reiterate that I fully accept the recommendations addressed to me contained in the report. It is a large and complex report and deserves to be given due consideration. This my Department and I will do. My Department fully accepts all recommendations from the AAIU report. I will ensure that recommendations addressed to the Minister are implemented. The provision of an effective maritime search and rescue service is critical to Ireland as an island nation with a strong maritime sector. The sector depends on the reliability and professionalism of the Irish Coast Guard and all its component parts, including the Coast Guard aviation service, to offer a service which can deploy at a moment's notice to rescue people in distress and bring them to a place of safety. The national search and rescue, SAR, plan is the key means by which we implement search and rescue policy in Ireland. The new national SAR plan is the baseline reference document for use by all search and rescue organisations in Ireland, and promulgates the agreed method of co-ordination through which search and rescue operations are conducted in Ireland's search and rescue region. The new national SAR committee, the national SAR consultative committee and the other structures, such as the SAR health and safety forum, provide a good framework to progress the co-ordination of the implementation of safety recommendations across all relevant bodies. The IAA has reviewed and fully accepts the recommendations addressed to it as the national aviation regulator, many of which have already been implemented or are proceeding to full implementation. The IAA will respond independently to the findings addressed to it. More broadly, in the overall context of improving safety in search and rescue operations, my officials have been engaging with the safety regulation division, SRD, of the IAA and the regulator himself. A team of technical experts within the safety regulation division is examining in detail the report, each finding and each safety recommendation. The IAA will use its regulatory oversight role to examine the implementation of the wider recommendations and provide any necessary support. The IAA will also continue to work with the European Commission and the EU Aviation Safety Agency in the development of safety rules.  The Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020 provides legislation underpinning an even more enhanced role for the IAA in terms of the oversight of Coast Guard aviation activities generally.The new provisions provide clarity and strengthen to the regulatory framework by ensuring the IAA, in making regulations that apply to the Coast Guard, takes into consideration the public benefit of the activities of the Coast Guard, which are very different in nature from commercial air transport activities, and consults with the Coast Guard as is good practice. The provisions further provide that in making regulations the IAA must align them with certain elements of European aviation safety regulations that are appropriate and relevant to Coast Guard aviation activities. In conjunction with the provisions in the Air Navigation and Transport Bill, secondary legislation is being prepared by the IAA to provide further operational clarity to operators of search and rescue. The IAA has developed a revised set of regulations and detailed rules specific to search and rescue that are being considered by the Department and the Coast Guard. The Irish national search and rescue rules are being developed to assist operational search and rescue stakeholders in determining the appropriate procedures and operations manual guidance to operate civil search and rescue helicopters in Ireland. With regard to the Department's oversight of the IAA's role in regulating search and rescue and other aviation activities, the Department engages aviation expertise for periodic oversight audits as required by national legislation. The Coast Guard has been operating and delivering an aviation search and rescue service for the past 30 years through a mix of private contractors and military. The Coast Guard carries out regular audits of the aviation service provider to ensure compliance with the contractual arrangements. The Coast Guard has in place a contract for the provision of helicopter aviation consultancy services. In addition to this, the Department has approved an aviation manager post in the Coast Guard. The successful candidate will have the requisite aviation knowledge, skills and experience and will manage the aviation contract and related operational and safety issues. The Department and Coast Guard are examining options to increase its in-house expertise on foot of the air accident investigation unit's recommendations. Recognising the detailed complex and interconnected findings, conclusions and safety recommendations contained in the report, I encourage Members to go to the report as the definitive source of information as to what contributed to the accident. It is unhelpful for findings to be inferred from the report that are not the findings of the investigation. I have listened very carefully to suggestions offered by Members on how we can further improve search and rescue operations. While a detailed programme of change is under way in the Coast Guard, I will continue to reflect on ways of further improving governance, oversight and safety procedures to ensure that Ireland can have a world-class search and rescue service. Uppermost in our thoughts right now are the crew of R116 and their families and loved ones. We must all ensure the findings and recommendations set out in the report of the investigation are fully implemented to prevent similar accidents occurring in future.	spk_356
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-10	dail	33	Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_22	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" It is satisfying to be able to bring the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 before the House. This Bill began life under the previous Government, with a number of important and necessary issues addressed, but we have added significantly to it in light of the programme for Government and emerging issues since the Government was formed. It is a large Bill and an important one. It will mark a positive advance across a wide range of areas and will be an important contribution to making our roads safer and more environmentally friendly for the benefit of all road users. In this Bill we will be legislating to meet our commitments to provide in law for e-scooters and e-bikes, as well as to deal with the menace of antisocial use of scramblers, quads, and other similar machines. The Bill will provide the necessary legislation to underpin delivery of the BusConnects project and dynamic traffic management on the M50. It will make important advances in the area of motor insurance to tackle uninsured driving. It will also modernise legislation in a number of areas such as: medical fitness to drive; regulation of driving instruction; and the system of fixed charge notices issued by traffic wardens. We have also committed in the programme for Government to the consolidation of road traffic law. This is a major project, which will involve not just consolidation but also identifying and correcting any anomalies which may be identified during the process. This Bill is our first priority in road traffic legislation, and we will turn to examining consolidation in more detail after this Bill is passed. I would like to thank all of the various people and organisations, too numerous to list individually, that have contributed to the development of the proposals in this Bill. It can be all too easy to say that we need to legislate for this or that, but getting it right is never easy, and always takes time.I would like to mention, though, the valuable input of the joint Oireachtas committee through the pre-legislative scrutiny process. The joint Oireachtas committee made a number of important comments, and we have taken those on board. In particular, the measures in the Bill which relate to databases have been discussed in detail with the Data Protection Commission to ensure they comply with all data protection requirements. The fundamental reason we have road traffic law is to ensure public safety. We all need to travel, for work, for shopping, for socialising and to access many services, whether they are educational, medical or anything else. We can and should reduce unnecessary travel, particularly unnecessary car journeys which add to our emissions, but we will always need travel and, therefore, safety for all road users will always be an issue. Ireland has made great progress on road safety since the turn of the millennium. In 1999, there were 413 deaths on Irish roads. In 2020, there were 149. The story is not entirely a straightforward one. If the general trend is down, the figures have fluctuated. The lowest year on record was, in fact, 2018, when there were 139 deaths on our roads. As of today, the figure for 2021 is 118 deaths, which is down 12 on this date last year. Everyone working in this area agrees that we are at a point where it is getting more difficult to bring the figures for deaths - and for serious injuries - down further. The big items which needed to be addressed - getting dangerous vehicles off our roads through the NCT, improving roads and driver training - have been done. They need to be maintained, of course, and enhanced where possible, but we are at a point where it has become harder to make an impact on the remaining annual tragedy of avoidable deaths on our roads. This Bill will provide a number of measures which will contribute to this goal, and I will explain those in a few moments. We also need to promote more active modes of travel, particularly walking and cycling. These are not only better for our environment as we take on the enormous challenge of climate change, but also healthier for individuals. As a culture, we are attached to private cars, and we have come to use them when other, better options are available, particularly for shorter local trips. One of the key deterrents to people walking and cycling more is a concern many people have about their safety and this is a direct result of the relative lack of proper infrasfructure for active travel. We are currently reviewing the processes associated with the provision of active travel infrastructure and we hope to bring forward amendments to improve the legislative basis for doing this during the passage of this Bill. Deputies will be aware that there is a very large body of road traffic legislation, covering a wide range of issues. This makes it all too easy to say that any given road traffic Bill, which will inevitably deal with only some of these issue, should be dealing with particular topics. I am well aware that these arguments can be made but I believe that we are putting as much into this Bill as we reasonably can, and that all of the policy proposals which are being put forward are valuable and will have real benefits to the public at large. The main challenge before me, as Minister of State at the Department of Transport, is to ensure the establishment of a sustainable transport system, with an optimal modal mix to meet both the travel needs of a changing Ireland and our responsibilities to our shared climate future. Micro-mobility options such as e-scooters and e-bikes have an important role to play in this sustainable transport mix. They provide new alternatives to commuting by car, new last-mile delivery options and new ways to explore our towns and cities while alleviating congestion and helping to improve our urban air quality. The programme for Government has committed us to legislating for their use and we are firmly setting that process in motion through this Bill. E-scooters have become very popular in recent years, both in Ireland and abroad. At the same time they have raised legal questions, such as what kind of vehicles are they and how do they fit into the framework of road traffic law. In Ireland, the answer is that they were automatically captured under the definition of ""mechanically propelled vehicles."" This means that you would need tax and insurance, as well as an appropriate driver licence, in order to use them in public. Since it is not possible to tax vehicles when they are not type-approved, and since there is no category of driver licence for e-scooters, this makes them effectively illegal for use in public. We want to change that. To reflect the rapid pace of technological development, the Bill proposes the establishment of a new vehicle category, called powered personal transporters, PPTs. This new vehicle category encompasses not only e-scooters, but other new and innovative micro-mobility vehicles that may need regulations in years to come, such as hoverboards, electric skateboards or segways. PPTs will be intended for use by one person only and will not be permitted to transport goods. This is a matter of safety for the people using them and for others in their vicinity. I would like to take the opportunity to clarify that these provisions will not apply to mobility scooters. The existing legislative framework for those vehicles will not be affected. The proposed approach will allow us to apply the range of powers and offences that already exist in road traffic legislation to powered personal transporters, and by extension, to e-scooters. Many of the amendments detailed in the Bill extend the powers of the Minister to make regulations for the use of e-scooters and for the minimum safety and environmental standards they should meet. Other amendments extend the road traffic offences and the powers of An Garda Síochána to allow them to enforce road traffic law in respect of these vehicles. Once the Bill has been approved by Government, the regulations specifically governing e-scooters will be made. The provisions in the Bill relating to e-scooters will be commenced in tandem with the completion of those regulations. This will ensure that a full legislative framework governing e-scooters can be implemented from the day that the regulations are signed into law. Until that time, use of e-scooters in public places will continue to be prohibited. Some of the provisions of these regulations are already clear. As with bicycles, registration, licensing, taxation and insurance will not be mandatory, nor will the use of helmets and other personal protection equipment, PPE, although this will be strongly recommended for user safety and the safety of other road users. We intend to set out minimum vehicle standards for e-scooters to ensure that they are safe to use and environmentally friendly. We will consider, among other items, their steering mechanisms, suitable weights and dimensions, braking, tyres and lighting. When technical standards are introduced in EU member states, a minimum 12-week standstill period is triggered to allow the European Commission and the other countries time to assess the national draft rules in light of EU rules. This process prevents regulatory barriers to the free movement of goods and information society services in the Union. This necessary and binding delay allows Ireland to meet our EU obligations under the Single Market Transparency Directive, but also means that regulations will not be introduced at the time of publication of the Bill. My Department is committed to progressing the regulations to publication as quickly as possible. I am, of course, very aware that this is an issue of great public interest and, indeed, an area in which many of my colleagues have taken an interest. In particular, I thank Deputies Farrell and Lahart for the considered and informative Private Members' Bills they introduced, both of which I have taken into account. While we have given due consideration to each proposal, it is our role in government to legislate for the safe use of e-scooters on public roads and in public places in all contexts, not solely in the context suggested in Deputy Lahart's proposal of a pilot or rental scheme. Furthermore, the Road Traffic Acts do not provide for powers to establish public or private vehicle rental schemes, and the Department of Transport has no function in this regard in such commercial enterprises. The governance of such schemes would be a matter for the local authority in question. However, each of the other issues raised by the Deputies in respect of both the vehicle standards and regulations for use and misuse will be addressed in full in either this Bill or in the subsequent regulations. In addition, the Bill will provide much-needed clarity to the growing cohort of e-bike users in Ireland by defining the requirements for low-powered e-bikes and high-powered e-bikes. Low-powered e-bikes, also known as pedelecs, are assisted by pedalling and can reach speeds of up to 25 km/h. We will continue to treat this kind of e-bike in the same way as an ordinary pedal bicycle, and the rules of the road for bicycles will apply accordingly. This type of e-bike will not require registration, taxation or licensing. High-powered e-bikes, which are those that can be used without pedalling or those that can reach speeds in excess of 25 km/h, will be treated in the same way as high-speed mopeds and, therefore, will need to be registered, taxed and insured, and used only by an appropriately licensed driver. This is because these e-bikes are capable of very high speeds - some up to 100 km/h - and present much greater danger to the user and to other vulnerable road users."	spk_303

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-09	dail	33	Regional Transport Infrastructure: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_17	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak about regional transport infrastructure. I have no doubt there will be much agreement among all of us on the importance of regional and rural transport infrastructure. Too often, when we talk about transport, we end up discussing the cities. However, I am keenly aware rural and regional Ireland need improvements to its transport infrastructure and I am happy to have the opportunity to update the House on what this Government will deliver in that regard. This Government is allocating unprecedented levels of funding toward improving active travel and greenway infrastructure throughout the country. For the first time, local authorities outside of the five cities can now apply for funding to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to support active travel improvements in towns and villages throughout the country, which is hugely positive. In our greenway programme, we are eager to see greenways better link in with local areas to ensure they become more than just tourism amenities and can connect local communities with each other and with local services. I note the motion seemingly calls on NTA funding to be provided to expressway services.Deputies will be aware that there are two types of public transport: publicly subvented public transport and commercially operated public transport. Taxpayer funding is provided to publicly subvented services through the public service obligation, PSO, programme. It is not provided to commercial services because they are commercial. It is a basic premise and also a feature of EU law. During the pandemic, Expressway, like other commercial operators, was able to avail of temporary Government financial support. However, the impact of the pandemic has been profound on certain Expressway routes from Galway, Limerick, Cork and Belfast. Following the decision to cease operating these Expressway services, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of various corridors to determine whether it was necessary for a replacement PSO service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. The NTA concluded that other than the X8 from Dublin to Cork route, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and that the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for further intervention. In relation to rail, the national development plan, NDP, commits to increased investment in the inter-urban and inter-regional rail network. This increased investment will permit track relaying on the Dublin to Cork line to increase line speeds. It has been facilitating track renewal works on the Ballybrophy line. It will also allow for improvements on the Limerick Junction to Waterford line. Importantly, a strategic rail review has commenced. It will examine all aspects of inter-urban and inter-regional rail on the island of Ireland. It will examine how to improve regional rail connectivity. The review will provide an investment framework for the development of the railway sector over the coming decades. As well as enhancing regional accessibility and supporting balanced regional development, it will consider the potential for high-speed rail links between the major cities. It will also consider the potential scope for improved rail services and infrastructure along the various existing or future potential corridors of the network, including the western rail corridor. It will provide the objective, evidence-informed basis we need to make investment decisions about the rail network. I expect a public that consultation phase on the review will commence in the next few weeks. I note the motion also refers to two of our regional cities, Cork and Galway. I am glad to report that there are significant projects under way in both cities. I am even more pleased to report that this Government will deliver significant projects in all four regional cities. In Cork and Galway, public consultation is well under way on the BusConnects projects in each city, with the NDP committing to substantial completion of those projects by 2030. In rail, phase one of the Cork commuter rail programme was included in Ireland's national recovery and resilience plan. It is scheduled for completion by 2026, with both Ceannt Station and Oranmore station having committed funding in the next few years for upgrades required at both stations. Early next year should see the completion of a feasibility study on possible future upgrades for the Athenry to Galway corridor. This Government and I recognise that we need to invest in our national, regional and rural road network. The NDP commits to maintaining the quality of the existing national road network, with approximately €2.5 billion earmarked for the protection and renewal of our existing assets across the State. Some €5.1 billion is also being allocated to new national roads out to 2030, which will enable better regional accessibility across the country, as well as compact growth. At a regional and local level, funding will allow the Department to continue to provide significant grant support for a range of protection and renewal programmes. Regional and local roads are a vital lifeline for rural communities and also act as public transport links for local link services as they exist today and will be expanded in the future. Taking to the skies for a moment, I would like to highlight the new Regional Airports Programme 2021 to 2025, which was published this year. The new programme proposes a continuation of the subsidised air services between Dublin and the regional airport at Donegal. As part of the new programme, €10 million in capital and €3.9 million in operational support has been made available to the regional airports during 2021. A further €6 million was made available under state aid-approved schemes to help airports mitigate the effects of Covid-19. Overall in 2021, three regional airports, Donegal, Ireland West Airport Knock, and Kerry, will have been allocated almost €20 million in Exchequer supports. The two regional State airports in Cork and Shannon will have received €51 million in 2021. This level of funding of our State airports is simply unprecedented.  Finally, on aviation, I note that the motion calls on the Government to prepare a new all-island national aviation policy. However, I would note that since its departure from the EU, the UK is no longer required to implement the EU  Transport connectivity is hugely important for people who live and work in rural and regional Ireland. It is key to bringing life back into our towns and villages. To have strong local economies, and to give people real options for getting around, one needs good transport links, including good public transport options. Expanding the public transport network and increasing service levels in the ways set out in our policies and currently being delivered by our projects will lead to a balanced regional development and greater connectivity.	spk_244
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy. I am taking questions this morning for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who must attend Cabinet. As Members know, the climate action plan is being launched later today. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Like many other sectors of the economy, road haulage is facing the dual challenges of rising costs and labour shortages. The global oil price has increased substantially in 2021. However, the Minister for Finance has retained the diesel rebate scheme for the present. The scheme, first introduced in 2013, allows haulage and bus operators licensed by the Department to apply to Revenue for a rebate on tax paid on diesel purchased in the State. The rebate rate is based on the average purchase price of diesel provided by the Central Statistics Office, CSO. The rebate amount is capped at 7.5 cent per litre. VAT-registered businesses are also eligible to claim a refund on the VAT paid for diesel used in the course of business activities. In relation to the shortage of heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers, the national logistics and supply chain skills group, chaired by the Department, has been engaged on this issue since it was established in 2019. All relevant Departments and agencies, as well as the haulage and logistics sector, are represented on the group. I have asked the group to examine the HGV driver shortage issue and make recommendations. In the meantime, I have been working with colleagues across government to help address the current difficulties. Following engagement with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, and discussions between the Department of Transport and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU is being removed. In tandem with this, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is pursuing HGV driver licence exchange agreements with a number of non-EU countries to allow drivers from these countries to apply for Irish employment permits. I have had a range of meetings with the haulage and logistics sector to discuss the issue and get their perspective on the key actions that will help to ease the current shortage of drivers. I have also written to the education and training boards in relation to the matter.	spk_106

The increase this year, which related to the already planned carbon tax, amounts to between 2 cent and 2.5 cent per litre of petrol and diesel. Revenue from any increase in carbon tax is ring-fenced and goes directly towards alleviating negative effects for those who cannot afford increases in the price of energy. I understand the pressures on the sector. I have been engaging with the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, and the Freight Transport Association of Ireland, FTAI, as well as haulage companies throughout the country to highlight the needs of the sector and to ensure we have a robust supply and do all we can on a cross-government level to address the driver shortage issue.

I will read out the reply on behalf of the Minister. DART+ West is the most advanced of the infrastructure projects that make up the overall DART+ programme. As outlined in the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, DART+ will extend or enhance the current DART system west to Maynooth and Celbridge-Hazelhatch, south to Greystones and north to Drogheda. The transport strategy sets the overall framework within which the programme is being developed, including its overall geographic scope. However, it is not to say that future extensions to the new network, once DART+ has been deployed, cannot be considered. In fact, as I understand it, the review of the transport strategy, which is under way and will be subject to public consultation this month, will make proposals in that regard. I have no doubt the Deputy will make her views known during the consultation period. I recognise that there is a view locally that the current DART+ West project should be extended to include Kilcock at the new depot on the line. That line lies west of Maynooth station on the way to Kilcock. I am informed that to extend the twin tracking and electrification beyond the depot into Kilcock faces a number of technical constraints, such as clearance issues at existing bridge structures; turnback facilities and the layout of the existing Kilcock station; and insufficient width on the approach to Kilcock to accommodate double tracking. These issues and others would require detailed consideration and engineering assessment. As I mentioned, DART+ West is currently the most advanced of all the DART+ infrastructure projects and the current focus is on ensuring the existing project is brought forward into the planning system and moves into construction as soon as possible. DART+ West will transform rail services in north Kildare, west Dublin and the broader region thanks to the new depot. I assure the Deputy that future extensions can be considered at a later date.	spk_112
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	I share the Deputy's ambition on this matter, as would most people. The two primary reasons we simply cannot extend DART+ to Kilcock at this point are linked to the way land use and transport planning works in the greater Dublin area and engineering. Uniquely in Ireland, there is a statutory transport strategy for the greater Dublin area and it has set the geographic scope of the DART+ programme. That scope is then reflected in all land use strategies for the area. The strategy states that the DART will be extended to Maynooth, which is the planning context for the overall DART+ West project that will be considered by the planning authorities. The scope can be changed but that must happen through the review of the transport strategy, which will reconfirm the delivery of DART+ as it stands, but will also state that future extensions beyond the current scope be considered in the future as separate projects. We could extend DART+ West to Kilcock but it first needs to be reflected in the transport strategy. It will then be considered as a stand-alone project into the future.	spk_114

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy for this question and the opportunity to discuss the very serious issue of antisocial behaviour on our public transport systems. The safety and security of both public transport passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with antisocial behaviour, are important matters that, first and foremost, must be managed by every public transport company, in conjunction with An Garda Síochána, where appropriate. The NTA is also engaged with public transport operators regarding the issue of antisocial behaviour. My Department has engaged regularly with the NTA and the three CIÉ companies on the issue of antisocial behaviour and in ensuring the safety of passengers and staff. In their responses, all three companies stressed their strong and close working relationships with An Garda Síochána on these issues. Furthermore, while I am of course concerned to ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place to ensure the safety of all passengers and staff, the allocation of all Garda resources, including the manner in which Garda personnel are deployed, is solely a decision for the Garda Commissioner and his management team. On the action being taken to ensure the safety of transport workers and passengers, my Department has been advised by Iarnród Éireann that a joint Iarnród Éireann-Garda focus on public order and antisocial behaviour has been in place since May of this year. A particular focus has been on the greater Dublin area with emphasis on the DART, the northern line and the Heuston to Portlaoise services. A new security monitoring centre, which has been in operation since January 2021, has played a key role in targeting high-risk locations with a particular focus on groups of youths with bicycles using the network to avoid Garda road checkpoints. For the months of June and July, 2,852 fixed penalty notices were issued during the joint operations for fare evasion, with 4,348 issued in the year to date.There has been a noticeable increase in compliance and a corresponding reduction in antisocial behaviour. A new text alert service has also been introduced to enable customers to discreetly report antisocial behaviour incidents and allow security personnel or gardaí to respond.	spk_120
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	It is important to note that An Garda Síochána engages extensively with transport operators and that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents and issues that have arisen at specific locations. There is ongoing communication between An Garda Síochána and the respective control centres and access to good-quality CCTV can assist the Garda when investigating serious incidents. For example, an interagency operation was established involving gardaí in Dublin and Iarnród Éireann targeting incidents of graffiti and criminal damage to train carriages on the north Dublin train line. As part of this operation, gardaí conducted patrols of rail lines in an effort to target groups involved in this activity. Iarnród Éireann's annual spend on security has risen from €3.7 million in 2016 to an expected spend this year of €5.2 million, with up to 20 security teams operating daily. It is a case of An Garda Síochána working with our public transport operators.	spk_122
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	To add to my earlier response, An Garda Síochána established regional quick-response hubs at Portlaoise and Thurles to support our intercity services in order to address incidents of antisocial behaviour on board our services, and this has had a significant impact in reducing antisocial behaviour and increasing compliance. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, while standing in for the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, spoke to the Garda Commissioner and senior gardaí about the issue of antisocial behaviour generally and a new operation will be launched very shortly. As the Deputy said, we have secured funding in the budget for 800 new gardaí next year, which will put us on track to meet and beat our target of having a 15,000-strong Garda Síochána force.	spk_124
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	I will come back to the Deputy on that.	spk_126
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. My response to Deputy O'Rourke's question earlier outlines the position in relation to the driver shortage and increasing fuel costs for the haulage sector. I will focus in this response on the overall position as regards the road haulage sector and supply chain issues. The programme for Government includes a commitment to publish and implement a ten-year haulage strategy, the first of its kind in Ireland, which will be focused on improving efficiencies and standards, and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future. A public consultation was held earlier this year and the responses to that consultation are being examined. Other forthcoming Government policies and initiatives such as the climate action plan and the new road safety strategy will be relevant in the context of the development of this new road haulage strategy. The intention is to carry out a further consultation on the draft strategy when these initiatives have been published. Like many other sectors, road haulage is facing the dual challenges of rising costs and labour shortages. The latest consumer price index release for September 2021 shows that prices, on average, were 3.7% higher in September 2021 year on year. The highest increases were in transport and fuel costs. In relation to the shortage of HGV drivers, the national logistics and supply chain skills group, chaired by my Department, has been taking action since it was established in 2019 on future skills needs across all areas of the supply chain. All relevant Departments and agencies, as well as the haulage and logistics sector, are represented on this group. I have asked the group to examine the HGV driver shortage issue and make recommendations. In the meantime, I have been working with colleagues across government to help address the current difficulties. For example, I have engaged with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English. Following those discussions, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU is being removed. The Road Safety Authority is also pursuing HGV driver licence exchange agreements with non-EU countries. I have held a range of meetings with the sector, as well as writing to Education and Training Boards Ireland to offer support for the many HGV driver courses offered by the ETBs right across the country.	spk_128
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	The climate action plan will be produced later today. We are going to need emissions reductions across every single sector and, as we are all aware and I am acutely aware from being in the Department, transport faces one of the bigger challenges in this area. We need to ensure that we can support the sectors that need the support most. We need a robust supply chain and that is why I am engaging with the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Freight Transport Association of Ireland and the logistics sector to ensure we can have a robust system. I spoke earlier about the diesel rebate scheme. That is just one part of it, as part of our ten-year haulage strategy. We need to be looking at where the sector will be over the next ten years. Now, with Covid and Brexit, this is a good opportunity to ensure we have a fit-for-purpose sector that is not only responding to the climate crisis but also ensures we have a robust supply chain and can keep foods and products on our shelves.	spk_130
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	I share the Deputy's concerns in regard to ensuring supports are in place. We introduced a grant scheme for alternatively fuelled HGVs and the uptake was extraordinary, which shows there is demand for this, although we need to do more. Technological advances will be required for the sector. I take the Deputy's point that we need HGV drivers. We can consider other matters through the ten-year haulage strategy regarding that final mile of delivery and what we can do to help reduce emissions. This is why we have opened the public consultation. We have had positive engagement from the sector but we need it to help the Government to help drivers to ensure there is a fit-for-purpose sector whereby we can reduce emissions but in a way-----	spk_132

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	I appreciate this issue is of great concern, which is why it has been raised in the House. I am very aware of increased prices at petrol and diesel pumps over recent weeks. This is an international trend. Wholesale energy prices have increased significantly following rises in international oil and gas prices and a post-lockdown surge in energy demand. While the trajectory of the global energy market is not within our control, indications are this current spike will abate over the coming months. My colleague the Minister for Finance sets policy in respect of tax and excise duties on fuel. The only increase in this year’s budget in this regard related to the already planned increase in carbon tax. At a time when the eyes of the world are on what governments in developed economies such as ours can do to address climate change, our carbon tax represents an important contribution to that effort. The diesel rebate scheme partially insulates the licensed haulage and bus sector from such fuel price increases. Under the scheme, qualifying road transport operators can apply for a repayment of part of the mineral oil tax paid on auto diesel purchased in the State. While this current spike in fuel prices is likely to be short lived, it is important to take this opportunity to take stock of our dependence on imported fossil fuels in the transport sector. The new climate action plan, which will be published today, will reduce our reliance on these fuels and allow us to transit to greener renewable energy sources for transport. Electrification of road transport is key. A comprehensive suite of measures is available to electric vehicle, EV, drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, and favourable motor and benefit-in-kind, BIK, tax rates. While I appreciate this does not relate to HGV drivers, the plan commits also to increasing biofuel blend rates. These are transitionary fuels that provide time for sectors such as haulage to invest in new, greener technology. As I mentioned, a grant scheme was launched in March to assist the purchase of alternatively fuelled heavy duty vehicles. The take-up of this scheme has been excellent and demonstrates the level of interest in this sector to make the transition.	spk_147
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	I take the point the HGV sector is reliant on fossil fuels and I am acutely aware of that. As part of this transition, we are trying to ensure we put in place supports such as the diesel rebate scheme. I mentioned the alternatively fuelled heavy duty vehicle grant, which had a significant uptake from the sector, showing the interest. We are also co-funding three research projects with Trinity College Dublin and University College Cork, focusing on decarbonising the freight sector. This will not be easy and it will not happen next week. I am very aware of that. Nevertheless, we are working across government to ensure we reduce our emissions and protect the sector. Part of that relates to the ten-year haulage strategy, the first of its kind in Ireland. Now is the time for people to feed in positively and constructively to the sector, as they are doing, relaying their needs and what they need to do to help support their sector into the future.	spk_149
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_18	I will continue to engage, as I have done since I came into this role, with the sector to ensure we protect it. I will also work with my Government colleagues, given this is not just a transport issue. For example, the Minister for Finance sets policy in respect of tax and excise duties on fuel and the only increase this year was the planned carbon tax increase. I will engage with them in respect of that ten-year haulage strategy, which is the vision. We need to set out that long-term plan as well as working on what I outlined earlier as the immediate concerns for the sector, namely, ensuring there is a robust supply chain and that we have the skillset, working with our educational centres, whether through skills for HGV drivers or research in the area of reducing emissions, and ensuring we have vehicles and the technology available.Some of the strategies are more for the long term. We are working on short, medium and long-term approaches. I share the Deputy's frustration and understand people's questions about the ambition to tackle these issues. This is a global challenge and we must rise to that challenge and work with sectors to ensure our approach is fair and achievable.	spk_151

The NTA is also engaged with public transport operators regarding the issue of antisocial behaviour. My Department has engaged regularly with the NTA and the three CIÉ companies on the issue of antisocial behaviour and in ensuring the safety of passengers and staff. In their responses, all three companies stressed their strong and close working relationships with An Garda Síochána on these issues. Furthermore, while I am of course concerned to ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place to ensure the safety of all passengers and staff, the allocation of all Garda resources, including the manner in which Garda personnel are deployed, is solely a decision for the Garda Commissioner and his management team. On the action being taken to ensure the safety of transport workers and passengers, my Department has been advised by Iarnród Éireann that a joint Iarnród Éireann-Garda focus on public order and antisocial behaviour has been in place since May of this year. A particular focus has been on the greater Dublin area with emphasis on the DART, the northern line and the Heuston to Portlaoise services. A new security monitoring centre, which has been in operation since January 2021, has played a key role in targeting high-risk locations with a particular focus on groups of youths with bicycles using the network to avoid Garda road checkpoints. For the months of June and July, 2,852 fixed penalty notices were issued during the joint operations for fare evasion, with 4,348 issued in the year to date.There has been a noticeable increase in compliance and a corresponding reduction in antisocial behaviour. A new text alert service has also been introduced to enable customers to discreetly report antisocial behaviour incidents and allow security personnel or gardaí to respond.	spk_120
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_21	It is important to note that An Garda Síochána engages extensively with transport operators and that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents and issues that have arisen at specific locations. There is ongoing communication between An Garda Síochána and the respective control centres and access to good-quality CCTV can assist the Garda when investigating serious incidents. For example, an interagency operation was established involving gardaí in Dublin and Iarnród Éireann targeting incidents of graffiti and criminal damage to train carriages on the north Dublin train line. As part of this operation, gardaí conducted patrols of rail lines in an effort to target groups involved in this activity. Iarnród Éireann's annual spend on security has risen from €3.7 million in 2016 to an expected spend this year of €5.2 million, with up to 20 security teams operating daily. It is a case of An Garda Síochána working with our public transport operators.	spk_122
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Public Transport	dbsect_21	To add to my earlier response, An Garda Síochána established regional quick-response hubs at Portlaoise and Thurles to support our intercity services in order to address incidents of antisocial behaviour on board our services, and this has had a significant impact in reducing antisocial behaviour and increasing compliance. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, while standing in for the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, spoke to the Garda Commissioner and senior gardaí about the issue of antisocial behaviour generally and a new operation will be launched very shortly. As the Deputy said, we have secured funding in the budget for 800 new gardaí next year, which will put us on track to meet and beat our target of having a 15,000-strong Garda Síochána force.	spk_124

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_22	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. My response to Deputy O'Rourke's question earlier outlines the position in relation to the driver shortage and increasing fuel costs for the haulage sector. I will focus in this response on the overall position as regards the road haulage sector and supply chain issues. The programme for Government includes a commitment to publish and implement a ten-year haulage strategy, the first of its kind in Ireland, which will be focused on improving efficiencies and standards, and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future. A public consultation was held earlier this year and the responses to that consultation are being examined. Other forthcoming Government policies and initiatives such as the climate action plan and the new road safety strategy will be relevant in the context of the development of this new road haulage strategy. The intention is to carry out a further consultation on the draft strategy when these initiatives have been published. Like many other sectors, road haulage is facing the dual challenges of rising costs and labour shortages. The latest consumer price index release for September 2021 shows that prices, on average, were 3.7% higher in September 2021 year on year. The highest increases were in transport and fuel costs. In relation to the shortage of HGV drivers, the national logistics and supply chain skills group, chaired by my Department, has been taking action since it was established in 2019 on future skills needs across all areas of the supply chain. All relevant Departments and agencies, as well as the haulage and logistics sector, are represented on this group. I have asked the group to examine the HGV driver shortage issue and make recommendations. In the meantime, I have been working with colleagues across government to help address the current difficulties. For example, I have engaged with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English. Following those discussions, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU is being removed. The Road Safety Authority is also pursuing HGV driver licence exchange agreements with non-EU countries. I have held a range of meetings with the sector, as well as writing to Education and Training Boards Ireland to offer support for the many HGV driver courses offered by the ETBs right across the country.	spk_128
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_22	The climate action plan will be produced later today. We are going to need emissions reductions across every single sector and, as we are all aware and I am acutely aware from being in the Department, transport faces one of the bigger challenges in this area. We need to ensure that we can support the sectors that need the support most. We need a robust supply chain and that is why I am engaging with the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Freight Transport Association of Ireland and the logistics sector to ensure we can have a robust system. I spoke earlier about the diesel rebate scheme. That is just one part of it, as part of our ten-year haulage strategy. We need to be looking at where the sector will be over the next ten years. Now, with Covid and Brexit, this is a good opportunity to ensure we have a fit-for-purpose sector that is not only responding to the climate crisis but also ensures we have a robust supply chain and can keep foods and products on our shelves.	spk_130
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_22	I share the Deputy's concerns in regard to ensuring supports are in place. We introduced a grant scheme for alternatively fuelled HGVs and the uptake was extraordinary, which shows there is demand for this, although we need to do more. Technological advances will be required for the sector. I take the Deputy's point that we need HGV drivers. We can consider other matters through the ten-year haulage strategy regarding that final mile of delivery and what we can do to help reduce emissions. This is why we have opened the public consultation. We have had positive engagement from the sector but we need it to help the Government to help drivers to ensure there is a fit-for-purpose sector whereby we can reduce emissions but in a way-----	spk_132

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_23	I appreciate this issue is of great concern, which is why it has been raised in the House. I am very aware of increased prices at petrol and diesel pumps over recent weeks. This is an international trend. Wholesale energy prices have increased significantly following rises in international oil and gas prices and a post-lockdown surge in energy demand. While the trajectory of the global energy market is not within our control, indications are this current spike will abate over the coming months. My colleague the Minister for Finance sets policy in respect of tax and excise duties on fuel. The only increase in this year’s budget in this regard related to the already planned increase in carbon tax. At a time when the eyes of the world are on what governments in developed economies such as ours can do to address climate change, our carbon tax represents an important contribution to that effort. The diesel rebate scheme partially insulates the licensed haulage and bus sector from such fuel price increases. Under the scheme, qualifying road transport operators can apply for a repayment of part of the mineral oil tax paid on auto diesel purchased in the State. While this current spike in fuel prices is likely to be short lived, it is important to take this opportunity to take stock of our dependence on imported fossil fuels in the transport sector. The new climate action plan, which will be published today, will reduce our reliance on these fuels and allow us to transit to greener renewable energy sources for transport. Electrification of road transport is key. A comprehensive suite of measures is available to electric vehicle, EV, drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, and favourable motor and benefit-in-kind, BIK, tax rates. While I appreciate this does not relate to HGV drivers, the plan commits also to increasing biofuel blend rates. These are transitionary fuels that provide time for sectors such as haulage to invest in new, greener technology. As I mentioned, a grant scheme was launched in March to assist the purchase of alternatively fuelled heavy duty vehicles. The take-up of this scheme has been excellent and demonstrates the level of interest in this sector to make the transition.	spk_147
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_23	I take the point the HGV sector is reliant on fossil fuels and I am acutely aware of that. As part of this transition, we are trying to ensure we put in place supports such as the diesel rebate scheme. I mentioned the alternatively fuelled heavy duty vehicle grant, which had a significant uptake from the sector, showing the interest. We are also co-funding three research projects with Trinity College Dublin and University College Cork, focusing on decarbonising the freight sector. This will not be easy and it will not happen next week. I am very aware of that. Nevertheless, we are working across government to ensure we reduce our emissions and protect the sector. Part of that relates to the ten-year haulage strategy, the first of its kind in Ireland. Now is the time for people to feed in positively and constructively to the sector, as they are doing, relaying their needs and what they need to do to help support their sector into the future.	spk_149
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Haulage Industry	dbsect_23	I will continue to engage, as I have done since I came into this role, with the sector to ensure we protect it. I will also work with my Government colleagues, given this is not just a transport issue. For example, the Minister for Finance sets policy in respect of tax and excise duties on fuel and the only increase this year was the planned carbon tax increase. I will engage with them in respect of that ten-year haulage strategy, which is the vision. We need to set out that long-term plan as well as working on what I outlined earlier as the immediate concerns for the sector, namely, ensuring there is a robust supply chain and that we have the skillset, working with our educational centres, whether through skills for HGV drivers or research in the area of reducing emissions, and ensuring we have vehicles and the technology available.Some of the strategies are more for the long term. We are working on short, medium and long-term approaches. I share the Deputy's frustration and understand people's questions about the ambition to tackle these issues. This is a global challenge and we must rise to that challenge and work with sectors to ensure our approach is fair and achievable.	spk_151
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	The Minister, Deputy Ryan, aims to publish the sustainable mobility policy framework before the end of this year. It will set out a strategic framework to 2030 for walking, cycling and public transport to support Ireland's overall requirement to achieve a 51% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of the decade. The framework will primarily focus on measures to promote and facilitate active travel and public transport for all and, in so doing, encourage less private car usage nationally to support our climate commitment. The climate action plan for 2021 sets out additional measures to promote other complementary transport mitigation measures such as the switch to electric car usage and greater use of renewable transport fuels. A collaborative approach has been taken by the Department in developing the sustainable mobility policy framework through public consultation and extensive stakeholder engagement. It will set out a comprehensive set of actions to increase active travel infrastructure provision and improve public transport capacity and services throughout the country. These actions will be supported by behavioural change and demand management measures to make sustainable modes the preferred choice for as many people as possible. Transport needs are not uniform throughout the country and we recognise that tailored solutions will be needed for both urban and rural areas. The new framework will be underpinned by funding under the national development plan, NDP, which provides €35 billion for transport over the next decade. This will enable significant investment in active travel, bus and rail infrastructure and the expansion of sustainable mobility options in our cities, towns and villages. This will be complemented by expanded public transport services throughout the country, as supported by the public service obligation, PSO, programme. The target of the policy framework will be to cater for daily travel needs in a more sustainable manner and deliver an additional 500,000 daily active travel and public transport journeys by 2030.	spk_153
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	The Deputy is entirely correct that this will require an approach across a number of areas, such as the safe routes to school initiative. However, it is not just about children in primary and secondary school having safe access; it is about local accessibility in towns and villages. It is not just an urban programme but one that will also work for rural areas. It is about enabling schools to work locally with their local authorities, particularly in tricky rural settings, to come up with solutions and models that can be replicated in other parts of the country. That was the call we put out through the National Transport Authority, NTA, when it was engaging with An Taisce on its Green-Schools initiatives with the local authorities. The message was that we were not just looking at urban areas but also at solutions for our rural towns and villages. The sustainable mobility framework will be closely aligned with the climate action plan and the strategic outcomes of the national planning framework, which will be especially important for regional accessibility, strengthening rural economies and ensuring we have sustainable mobility in the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society.	spk_155
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	The Deputy is right to mention Connecting Ireland. When we talk about public transport, there is the issue that people have a vision focusing on urban Ireland and our cities. Connecting Ireland is about delivering public transport in rural towns and villages throughout the country. That is key if we want to ensure people in rural Ireland have connectivity. However, we also need to be practical and realistic in recognising that not every rural area will have a public transport option. The aim is to maximise the potential of those routes and have evidence-based policy in regard to public transport services in rural areas throughout the country. The draft policy framework is looking at issues like ensuring continued mobility safety, decarbonising public transport, expanding the metropolitan area sustainability options, expanding rural and regional sustainable mobility options, and encouraging people to choose sustainable mobility over the private car. We want transport-led development. This is about an all-of-government approach to ensuring we are building in the right areas and, where we have housing developments, that there is a sustainable, integrated transport system aligned with them.	spk_157

Road traffic legislation sets out the standards for the use of such cameras and their effect in terms of road traffic law. Under section 81 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, electronic apparatus, including cameras, may be used to provide evidence in regard to offences under a number of the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts. The enforcement of road traffic law is a matter for the Garda Síochána, with some powers provided for local authorities in respect of parking controls. The installation of cameras for traffic management is a matter for the relevant road authority. Regarding the installation of cameras to detect red light offences, in 2015 to 2016, a pilot was successfully carried out at the intersection of Blackhall Place and Benburb Street in Dublin, on the red Luas line, under an agreement between the NTA and the Garda Síochána. The NTA operated the system and provided images to An Garda Síochána, which had responsibility for processing violations. The aim of the pilot was to reduce collisions at that intersection between cars and trams on the red line. Following a review of the project, two further locations have been selected for red light cameras, namely, Con Colbert Road and Queen Street. My Department has been advised the NTA will be developing system design and technical specifications for tenders to install and operate the three sites. Separately, the role of additional camera-based enforcement and its potential road safety benefits is being considered by the Department and transport agencies.	spk_159
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	Following the completion of the pilot, a review of the overall system was undertaken, and in 2019, An Garda Síochána confirmed acceptance of the review recommendations and that the pilot installation could be confirmed as permanent. However, it was necessary to retender the technical and operational parts of the project, as the original installation was a pilot project only. Under procurement legislation, the larger permanent operation requires a new, publicly advertised tender process. Due to Covid commitments, the NTA has not progressed the retendering process. It intends to develop the system design and technical specifications for the Blackhall Place site, as well as the additional sites at Con Colbert Road and Queen Street and seek tenders in the next year. While the Blackhall Place site is not currently operational, it is expected to be reactivated following the appointment of a specialist service provider. During 2023, it is expected the additional two sites, Con Colbert Road and Queen Street, will be activated.	spk_161
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	I hear the Deputy's concerns. There is no legislative barrier to this. The Department does the legislation and it is up to the agencies - the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, An Garda Síochána and the local authorities - to roll out these projects. I take her points on accessibility on public transport. We have increased Garda resources in this budget. The Deputy made reference to antisocial behaviour on our public transport services. This came up earlier, with other Deputies. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has spoken to the Garda Commissioner and the Garda is engaging extensively with public transport service operators in ensuring we can make certain both staff and passengers are safe. The work is ongoing, but I will relay Deputy Hourigan's comments to the Minister, Deputy Ryan.	spk_163
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	I thank the Deputy for his question and the opportunity to discuss the issue of increased capacity and the frequency on our rail lines, specifically the Dublin-Rosslare rail line. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, has responsibility for policy and overall funding for public transport, however, neither he nor my Department have a role in the day-to-day provision, operation, or maintenance of subsidised bus and rail services. That is the responsibility, first and foremost, of the NTA, in conjunction with public transport operators such as Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann, Go-Ahead Ireland, Luas or, in this instance, Iarnród Éireann. Iarnród Éireann has advised that its operational fleet is fully deployed in the provision of scheduled services at present, in line with prevailing passenger demand across the network. The current capacity is primarily based on demand levels pre-Covid, when rapid growth in passenger demand resulted in the use of 100% of the company's operational fleet at peak times. Post-Covid, demand remains suppressed in the short term, and as we continue to exit the Covid-19 restrictions, significantly altered travel patterns have emerged. Iarnród Éireann has advised that it intends to undertake an analysis of this new trend in customer habits and adapt its timetable to meet customer demands. It is expected this assessment will take a number of months as travel patterns become established, with a phased return to the workplace over the coming months, depending on the prevailing epidemiological situation. Once this process has been completed, a timetable and capacity proposal will be prepared and issued for public consultation on the Irish Rail website. It is currently estimated that this process will commence in the second quarter of 2022. The recently announced national development plan will see the introduction of additional infrastructure which will relieve congestion on the network while also delivering new trains to provide greater capacity for increasing passenger numbers into the future. A range of projects are under way which will continue over the next 12 months, such as the national train control centre, track laying and new intercity railcars. These 41 carriages are under construction and scheduled for delivery in 2022.	spk_165
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	Iarnród Éireann, supported by the NTA, is at an advanced stage in the tender process to order the largest and greenest fleet in Irish public transport history, for up to 750 electric and battery-electric powered carriages over a ten-year timescale. As well as increasing the Dublin area capacity, it will also see intercity carriages in use on commuter services allocated to intercity routes to increase capacity and frequency of services. With regard to the possibility of increasing the DART frequency on the Dublin to Rosslare route, between Bray and Greystones, there is an issue with physical infrastructure constraints. The railway between Bray and Greystones is single track, which means only one service can operate between Bray and Greystones at any given time. Journey time between the two takes ten minutes each way, and both of these factors dictate the level of frequency which can be achieved. The DART+ coastal project is in the design and planning phase. One of its key goals is to identify opportunities for capacity enhancement between Bray and Greystones. Public consultation will be under way on those emerging options.	spk_167

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	A Department internal audit report in 2019 recommended improvements in Coast Guard procurement. Implementation of these recommendations was underway prior to the Comptroller and Auditor General raising the issue of procurement of vehicles in 2020. In particular, new internal controls in accordance with best practice procurement procedures have been put in place. Additional resources have been allocated to the area and training has been enhanced. Insofar as this specific issue is concerned, it was identified as a deviation event through the Coast Guard’s deviation and risk management procedures. A corresponding investigation regarding the suitability of the assets procured in support of cliff rescue operations occurred on 4 February 2020. The recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report relate to specification of requirements, tendering supply and delivery of vehicles and procurement processes. These recommendations are accepted and are being implemented. The vehicles procured under the contract are currently fulfilling an operational role for the Coast Guard. The vehicles purchased are a considerable improvement on the previous vans in use by cliff rescue teams. This is because they have additional carrying capacity, improved storage of equipment, welfare facilities, air conditioning, dry equipment, additional radios and under-chassis sealing. Coast Guard cliff rescue teams continue to rely on multiple vehicle types to respond to cliff incidents. The Coast Guard continues to review procurement procedures on an ongoing basis to ensure that they comply with best practice in the area.	spk_175
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	It is important to say that improved procurement procedures have been implemented within the Coast Guard area. In 2019, my Department’s internal audit unit carried out a procurement gap analysis, which identifies a number of areas with significant scope for improvement. The following eight recommendations are contained in the March 2020 audit report: the Irish Coast Guard, IRCG, procurement procedures are to be documented; there is to be better procurement documentation filing and retention; there is to be a live contracts register on finance and procurement SharePoint site; avoid appointment of contractors without competition; improve tender specification costs; improve contract management, contract planning; and carry out evaluations of procurements. These eight recommendations in the internal audit report on Coast Guard procurement were all implemented by the end of November 2020. A procurement manual was finalised in November 2020 which sets out the process from a formal assessment of operational needs to a business case. Training and procurement workshops are available to all staff involved in the procurement process. The Coast Guard continues to revisit procurement procedures and updates the manual regularly to take into account new guidelines.	spk_177

We are all aware in our own communities of the excellent volunteers who do critical, Trojan work in coming to people’s rescue in their hour of need. It is critical. I am committed to ensuring that whatever resources and supports are needed are in place to ensure that we have continued service. On the Deputy’s point about Doolin, search and rescue and the Department are engaged in providing whatever supports are necessary to help resolve the situation. We have good management teams right across the country. Where there are challenges, we need to address them. We need to ensure that they are resolved. That is my commitment. I have been liaising with officials in my Department. I will do whatever is needed, the Deputy can be assured, to ensure that we get a resolution. At the moment, however, I have been assured that there is adequate cover. From time to time, certain teams step down for different reasons, such as operational reasons. In those situations, cover is provided elsewhere.I continue to monitor the situation and I understand the importance of this issue.	spk_179
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	The Minister for Transport has responsibility for overall policy and Exchequer funding in relation to the national roads programme. Under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, and in line with the national development plan, NDP, the management and improvement of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with local authorities. A key priority in the NDP, in line with the Department’s investment hierarchy, is to maintain the quality of the existing national road network. This consists of about 5,300 km of national roads, including 1,000 km of motorways, connecting Ireland’s cities and regions. I take the Deputy's point about ensuring that we have that connectivity. The NDP foresees Exchequer expenditure of about €2.9 billion on the protection and renewal of these national roads over the period to 2030. Such investment is required to keep the national road assets at a safe and robust level for all users. Investment in existing road assets can also assist in retrofitting them where applicable, for example by providing new bus lanes. Further, approximately €5.1 billion will be spent on new national road projects over the lifetime of the revised NDP to 2030. This funding will enable improved connectivity across the country, as well as compact growth, which are core components of the revised NDP. The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority and works on those roads are funded from councils' own resources, supplemented by Exchequer grants where applicable. Grant support provided by the Department under the regional and local road grant programme is focused primarily on the protection and renewal of the network and the NDP makes provision for expenditure of €5.35 billion on this in the period to 2030. Provision is also being made for expenditure of €677 million on targeted road improvements for that period. Within the context of the capital ceilings set for the Department and its delivery agencies, the funding allocation for new public transport and new roads is in keeping with the agreement in the programme for Government.

Ensuring that minimum standards are kept is a matter for local authorities. Local authorities, with TII, identify roads that need to be further maintained. The maintenance, protection and renewal budget was protected, which recognises the importance of road connectivity and safety for all road users. It is critical that we have new road infrastructure built as part of that. Public transport uses roads. We also need to make sure that we maintain and upgrade our existing road network to ensure we meet the minimum standards and that we retrofit, where possible, by putting in bus lanes, for example. All of this will form part of our vision for ensuring that we are connecting Ireland both in our rural and urban settings.	spk_183
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	I thank both Deputies. A list of projects is mentioned in the NDP. Projects currently under construction are the M50 traffic control management unit, the N5 from Westport to Turlough, the N56 from Dungloe to Glenties, the N22 from Baile Bhuirne to Macroom, the M8 Dunkettle interchange, and the N5 from Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge. There are other projects earmarked to begin construction within the coming months, for example, the N59 Moycullen bypass and the Listowel bypass. Deputies may feel that other projects are absolutely critical. We all have our own views on our own areas that we are familiar with, including local employment, local education and the connectivity that is required. It is up to the local representatives, working with local authorities, to put forward proposals regarding further projects that may be deemed necessary, looking at demographics, employment and future prospects over the next few years. That is part of the national development plan too. It explicitly states that local authorities can put forward proposals on projects that may be deemed necessary for their areas.	spk_186
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	As the Deputy knows, and this is probably the reason he is asking, in the programme for Government we committed that €360 million in cross-Government funding will be spent on walking and cycling infrastructure per annum over the lifetime of the Government. This investment will help to support the delivery of about 1,000 km of new and improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025 as well as additional investment in greenways. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this year we have seen a significant increase in funding in line with the Government's prioritisation of active travel and greenways. My Department provided approximately €287 million in funding this year to the National Transport Authority, NTA, for active travel projects. This allocation is enabling investment in the greater Dublin area and the regional cities along with an additional investment in projects in 19 other local authority areas. The latter funding stream constitutes the first ever major active travel investment programme for rural Ireland. A further €70 million was allocated to greenway projects. The significant increase in funding requires additional capacity and resources to be made available in the local authorities to deliver the projects as planned. To this end, earlier this year, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, wrote to the County and City Management Association to advise that approximately 250 additional staff would be allocated to local authorities around the country to work on the delivery of active travel projects. I understand the recruitment process is ongoing and I hope to see all the staff in place by early 2022. As we emerge from Covid, we have a major opportunity to change the way we travel in this country and I am pleased to say that, despite the challenges of Covid as well as the need to recruit additional staff in the local authorities, it is expected that 80% of the total active travel financial allocation will be spent by the end of this year.	spk_188
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	I think €287 million or quarter of a billion euro is a significant figure, especially in the context of Covid-19, given that greenways, which are part of this, were not considered essential works during the lockdown. That may have brought the figure down slightly but as the resources are allocated to local authorities in relation to active travel projects, we will see - and we will monitor this - an increase year on year in the roll-out of active travel infrastructure. I note what the Deputy says on rural towns and villages. It is important to say that additional funding of €72 million was announced in March for 340 sustainable transport projects in 19 local authorities outside the greater Dublin area in our regional cities. The NTA originally earmarked €50 million for the scheme but it was increased due to the volume of proposals. That shows there is an appetite to roll these out in our regional cities, towns and villages. I encourage local authorities to continue to do that but we need to resource those authorities around that.	spk_190
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	Absolutely. It is said by people who engage in and spearhead cycle buses that hopefully one day we will not need them and will have safe routes to school and protected infrastructure such that parents feel confident to let their children cycle to school appropriately. What is important about the safe routes to school programme is that the schools are actively involved in these solutions. It is not just the local authority coming in and proposing something outside of the school space. It is the schools working with parents and the real leaders are the students. They say what they require, be it cycle parking or a walk and stride facility. Our commitment is to roll out that €360 million per year on walking and cycling facilities. This is just the start and it will ramp up. If we get good examples in urban, rural and suburban areas that can be replicated across the country, and if leaders roll out schemes in areas where it was thought not to be possible, that will encourage others to do the same.	spk_192
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	I thank the Deputy. Providing a sustainable low-carbon transport system is a key priority for the Department. The programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reductions to 2030. Ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050 and electrification will be key to achieving that in the transport sector. EVs are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 climate action plan and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. To this end, my Department has convened the electric vehicle policy pathway working group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The working group comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial and taxation policies to help to drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.  Scrappage schemes were discussed as part of these considerations. The working group considered the potential of this incentive but concluded that a general scrappage scheme would entail significant additional costs. However, the group concluded that niche market scrappage schemes could potentially play an important role, such as in the small public service vehicles, SPSV, sector. Furthermore, considerable progress has been made as a result of the work of the low-emission vehicle task force to ensure conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. A comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and benefit-in-kind tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have contributed to increased take-up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to around 45,000	spk_194
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	The Deputy made some valid points in relation to looking at other areas. Preparations are under way to establish an office of low emissions vehicles. This office will play an important role in our transition to zero-emission vehicles and will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the roll-out of charge point infrastructure. In the context of rural Ireland, we spoke about Connecting Ireland, which concerns a public transport system across rural Ireland, but we have to be realistic. We will not have public transport in every area of rural Ireland. It is not feasible. We know this clearly. We need to look at ways to help people to move to a more environmentally friendly vehicle. I would like to see the office of low emissions vehicle looking at that. The move to electric vehicles will be a critical part in emissions reduction.	spk_196
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_24	I agree that we must consider targeted measures based on service provision across the country. There will be people who will need a private car. The evidence is there regarding emissions reductions with electric vehicles. In particular where people have no other alternative, we must look at measures in that respect. I will not go into the grants. Deputy Duncan Smith is very well aware that there is going to be a concerted public service element as well, including for taxis. The public sector is leading the way. An Post, for example, has invested hugely in electric vehicles for its fleet. We must lead as well, but also look at supports and targeted incentives for certain sectors and regions that may need extra help.	spk_198
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_25	The Minister, Deputy Ryan, aims to publish the sustainable mobility policy framework before the end of this year. It will set out a strategic framework to 2030 for walking, cycling and public transport to support Ireland's overall requirement to achieve a 51% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of the decade. The framework will primarily focus on measures to promote and facilitate active travel and public transport for all and, in so doing, encourage less private car usage nationally to support our climate commitment. The climate action plan for 2021 sets out additional measures to promote other complementary transport mitigation measures such as the switch to electric car usage and greater use of renewable transport fuels. A collaborative approach has been taken by the Department in developing the sustainable mobility policy framework through public consultation and extensive stakeholder engagement. It will set out a comprehensive set of actions to increase active travel infrastructure provision and improve public transport capacity and services throughout the country. These actions will be supported by behavioural change and demand management measures to make sustainable modes the preferred choice for as many people as possible. Transport needs are not uniform throughout the country and we recognise that tailored solutions will be needed for both urban and rural areas. The new framework will be underpinned by funding under the national development plan, NDP, which provides €35 billion for transport over the next decade. This will enable significant investment in active travel, bus and rail infrastructure and the expansion of sustainable mobility options in our cities, towns and villages. This will be complemented by expanded public transport services throughout the country, as supported by the public service obligation, PSO, programme. The target of the policy framework will be to cater for daily travel needs in a more sustainable manner and deliver an additional 500,000 daily active travel and public transport journeys by 2030.	spk_153
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_25	The Deputy is entirely correct that this will require an approach across a number of areas, such as the safe routes to school initiative. However, it is not just about children in primary and secondary school having safe access; it is about local accessibility in towns and villages. It is not just an urban programme but one that will also work for rural areas. It is about enabling schools to work locally with their local authorities, particularly in tricky rural settings, to come up with solutions and models that can be replicated in other parts of the country. That was the call we put out through the National Transport Authority, NTA, when it was engaging with An Taisce on its Green-Schools initiatives with the local authorities. The message was that we were not just looking at urban areas but also at solutions for our rural towns and villages. The sustainable mobility framework will be closely aligned with the climate action plan and the strategic outcomes of the national planning framework, which will be especially important for regional accessibility, strengthening rural economies and ensuring we have sustainable mobility in the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society.	spk_155
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Transport Policy	dbsect_25	The Deputy is right to mention Connecting Ireland. When we talk about public transport, there is the issue that people have a vision focusing on urban Ireland and our cities. Connecting Ireland is about delivering public transport in rural towns and villages throughout the country. That is key if we want to ensure people in rural Ireland have connectivity. However, we also need to be practical and realistic in recognising that not every rural area will have a public transport option. The aim is to maximise the potential of those routes and have evidence-based policy in regard to public transport services in rural areas throughout the country. The draft policy framework is looking at issues like ensuring continued mobility safety, decarbonising public transport, expanding the metropolitan area sustainability options, expanding rural and regional sustainable mobility options, and encouraging people to choose sustainable mobility over the private car. We want transport-led development. This is about an all-of-government approach to ensuring we are building in the right areas and, where we have housing developments, that there is a sustainable, integrated transport system aligned with them.	spk_157

Road traffic legislation sets out the standards for the use of such cameras and their effect in terms of road traffic law. Under section 81 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, electronic apparatus, including cameras, may be used to provide evidence in regard to offences under a number of the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts. The enforcement of road traffic law is a matter for the Garda Síochána, with some powers provided for local authorities in respect of parking controls. The installation of cameras for traffic management is a matter for the relevant road authority. Regarding the installation of cameras to detect red light offences, in 2015 to 2016, a pilot was successfully carried out at the intersection of Blackhall Place and Benburb Street in Dublin, on the red Luas line, under an agreement between the NTA and the Garda Síochána. The NTA operated the system and provided images to An Garda Síochána, which had responsibility for processing violations. The aim of the pilot was to reduce collisions at that intersection between cars and trams on the red line. Following a review of the project, two further locations have been selected for red light cameras, namely, Con Colbert Road and Queen Street. My Department has been advised the NTA will be developing system design and technical specifications for tenders to install and operate the three sites. Separately, the role of additional camera-based enforcement and its potential road safety benefits is being considered by the Department and transport agencies.	spk_159
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Road Traffic Offences	dbsect_26	Following the completion of the pilot, a review of the overall system was undertaken, and in 2019, An Garda Síochána confirmed acceptance of the review recommendations and that the pilot installation could be confirmed as permanent. However, it was necessary to retender the technical and operational parts of the project, as the original installation was a pilot project only. Under procurement legislation, the larger permanent operation requires a new, publicly advertised tender process. Due to Covid commitments, the NTA has not progressed the retendering process. It intends to develop the system design and technical specifications for the Blackhall Place site, as well as the additional sites at Con Colbert Road and Queen Street and seek tenders in the next year. While the Blackhall Place site is not currently operational, it is expected to be reactivated following the appointment of a specialist service provider. During 2023, it is expected the additional two sites, Con Colbert Road and Queen Street, will be activated.	spk_161
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Road Traffic Offences	dbsect_26	I hear the Deputy's concerns. There is no legislative barrier to this. The Department does the legislation and it is up to the agencies - the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, An Garda Síochána and the local authorities - to roll out these projects. I take her points on accessibility on public transport. We have increased Garda resources in this budget. The Deputy made reference to antisocial behaviour on our public transport services. This came up earlier, with other Deputies. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has spoken to the Garda Commissioner and the Garda is engaging extensively with public transport service operators in ensuring we can make certain both staff and passengers are safe. The work is ongoing, but I will relay Deputy Hourigan's comments to the Minister, Deputy Ryan.	spk_163
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Rail Network	dbsect_27	I thank the Deputy for his question and the opportunity to discuss the issue of increased capacity and the frequency on our rail lines, specifically the Dublin-Rosslare rail line. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, has responsibility for policy and overall funding for public transport, however, neither he nor my Department have a role in the day-to-day provision, operation, or maintenance of subsidised bus and rail services. That is the responsibility, first and foremost, of the NTA, in conjunction with public transport operators such as Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann, Go-Ahead Ireland, Luas or, in this instance, Iarnród Éireann. Iarnród Éireann has advised that its operational fleet is fully deployed in the provision of scheduled services at present, in line with prevailing passenger demand across the network. The current capacity is primarily based on demand levels pre-Covid, when rapid growth in passenger demand resulted in the use of 100% of the company's operational fleet at peak times. Post-Covid, demand remains suppressed in the short term, and as we continue to exit the Covid-19 restrictions, significantly altered travel patterns have emerged. Iarnród Éireann has advised that it intends to undertake an analysis of this new trend in customer habits and adapt its timetable to meet customer demands. It is expected this assessment will take a number of months as travel patterns become established, with a phased return to the workplace over the coming months, depending on the prevailing epidemiological situation. Once this process has been completed, a timetable and capacity proposal will be prepared and issued for public consultation on the Irish Rail website. It is currently estimated that this process will commence in the second quarter of 2022. The recently announced national development plan will see the introduction of additional infrastructure which will relieve congestion on the network while also delivering new trains to provide greater capacity for increasing passenger numbers into the future. A range of projects are under way which will continue over the next 12 months, such as the national train control centre, track laying and new intercity railcars. These 41 carriages are under construction and scheduled for delivery in 2022.	spk_165
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Rail Network	dbsect_27	Iarnród Éireann, supported by the NTA, is at an advanced stage in the tender process to order the largest and greenest fleet in Irish public transport history, for up to 750 electric and battery-electric powered carriages over a ten-year timescale. As well as increasing the Dublin area capacity, it will also see intercity carriages in use on commuter services allocated to intercity routes to increase capacity and frequency of services. With regard to the possibility of increasing the DART frequency on the Dublin to Rosslare route, between Bray and Greystones, there is an issue with physical infrastructure constraints. The railway between Bray and Greystones is single track, which means only one service can operate between Bray and Greystones at any given time. Journey time between the two takes ten minutes each way, and both of these factors dictate the level of frequency which can be achieved. The DART+ coastal project is in the design and planning phase. One of its key goals is to identify opportunities for capacity enhancement between Bray and Greystones. Public consultation will be under way on those emerging options.	spk_167

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Coast Guard Service	dbsect_28	A Department internal audit report in 2019 recommended improvements in Coast Guard procurement. Implementation of these recommendations was underway prior to the Comptroller and Auditor General raising the issue of procurement of vehicles in 2020. In particular, new internal controls in accordance with best practice procurement procedures have been put in place. Additional resources have been allocated to the area and training has been enhanced. Insofar as this specific issue is concerned, it was identified as a deviation event through the Coast Guard’s deviation and risk management procedures. A corresponding investigation regarding the suitability of the assets procured in support of cliff rescue operations occurred on 4 February 2020. The recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report relate to specification of requirements, tendering supply and delivery of vehicles and procurement processes. These recommendations are accepted and are being implemented. The vehicles procured under the contract are currently fulfilling an operational role for the Coast Guard. The vehicles purchased are a considerable improvement on the previous vans in use by cliff rescue teams. This is because they have additional carrying capacity, improved storage of equipment, welfare facilities, air conditioning, dry equipment, additional radios and under-chassis sealing. Coast Guard cliff rescue teams continue to rely on multiple vehicle types to respond to cliff incidents. The Coast Guard continues to review procurement procedures on an ongoing basis to ensure that they comply with best practice in the area.	spk_175
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Coast Guard Service	dbsect_28	It is important to say that improved procurement procedures have been implemented within the Coast Guard area. In 2019, my Department’s internal audit unit carried out a procurement gap analysis, which identifies a number of areas with significant scope for improvement. The following eight recommendations are contained in the March 2020 audit report: the Irish Coast Guard, IRCG, procurement procedures are to be documented; there is to be better procurement documentation filing and retention; there is to be a live contracts register on finance and procurement SharePoint site; avoid appointment of contractors without competition; improve tender specification costs; improve contract management, contract planning; and carry out evaluations of procurements. These eight recommendations in the internal audit report on Coast Guard procurement were all implemented by the end of November 2020. A procurement manual was finalised in November 2020 which sets out the process from a formal assessment of operational needs to a business case. Training and procurement workshops are available to all staff involved in the procurement process. The Coast Guard continues to revisit procurement procedures and updates the manual regularly to take into account new guidelines.	spk_177
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Coast Guard Service	dbsect_28	It is critical that we have a robust and well-resourced search and rescue, SAR, capability in Ireland. We are all aware in our own communities of the excellent volunteers who do critical, Trojan work in coming to people’s rescue in their hour of need. It is critical. I am committed to ensuring that whatever resources and supports are needed are in place to ensure that we have continued service. On the Deputy’s point about Doolin, search and rescue and the Department are engaged in providing whatever supports are necessary to help resolve the situation. We have good management teams right across the country. Where there are challenges, we need to address them. We need to ensure that they are resolved. That is my commitment. I have been liaising with officials in my Department. I will do whatever is needed, the Deputy can be assured, to ensure that we get a resolution. At the moment, however, I have been assured that there is adequate cover. From time to time, certain teams step down for different reasons, such as operational reasons.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Road Network	dbsect_29	The Minister for Transport has responsibility for overall policy and Exchequer funding in relation to the national roads programme. Under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, and in line with the national development plan, NDP, the management and improvement of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with local authorities. A key priority in the NDP, in line with the Department’s investment hierarchy, is to maintain the quality of the existing national road network. This consists of about 5,300 km of national roads, including 1,000 km of motorways, connecting Ireland’s cities and regions. I take the Deputy's point about ensuring that we have that connectivity. The NDP foresees Exchequer expenditure of about €2.9 billion on the protection and renewal of these national roads over the period to 2030. Such investment is required to keep the national road assets at a safe and robust level for all users. Investment in existing road assets can also assist in retrofitting them where applicable, for example by providing new bus lanes. Further, approximately €5.1 billion will be spent on new national road projects over the lifetime of the revised NDP to 2030. This funding will enable improved connectivity across the country, as well as compact growth, which are core components of the revised NDP. The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority and works on those roads are funded from councils' own resources, supplemented by Exchequer grants where applicable. Grant support provided by the Department under the regional and local road grant programme is focused primarily on the protection and renewal of the network and the NDP makes provision for expenditure of €5.35 billion on this in the period to 2030. Provision is also being made for expenditure of €677 million on targeted road improvements for that period. Within the context of the capital ceilings set for the Department and its delivery agencies, the funding allocation for new public transport and new roads is in keeping with the agreement in the programme for Government. A 2:1 ratio will be maintained between new public transport investment and new road investment.	spk_181

Ensuring that minimum standards are kept is a matter for local authorities. Local authorities, with TII, identify roads that need to be further maintained. The maintenance, protection and renewal budget was protected, which recognises the importance of road connectivity and safety for all road users. It is critical that we have new road infrastructure built as part of that. Public transport uses roads. We also need to make sure that we maintain and upgrade our existing road network to ensure we meet the minimum standards and that we retrofit, where possible, by putting in bus lanes, for example. All of this will form part of our vision for ensuring that we are connecting Ireland both in our rural and urban settings.	spk_183

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Cycling Facilities	dbsect_30	As the Deputy knows, and this is probably the reason he is asking, in the programme for Government we committed that €360 million in cross-Government funding will be spent on walking and cycling infrastructure per annum over the lifetime of the Government. This investment will help to support the delivery of about 1,000 km of new and improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025 as well as additional investment in greenways. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this year we have seen a significant increase in funding in line with the Government's prioritisation of active travel and greenways. My Department provided approximately €287 million in funding this year to the National Transport Authority, NTA, for active travel projects. This allocation is enabling investment in the greater Dublin area and the regional cities along with an additional investment in projects in 19 other local authority areas. The latter funding stream constitutes the first ever major active travel investment programme for rural Ireland. A further €70 million was allocated to greenway projects. The significant increase in funding requires additional capacity and resources to be made available in the local authorities to deliver the projects as planned. To this end, earlier this year, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, wrote to the County and City Management Association to advise that approximately 250 additional staff would be allocated to local authorities around the country to work on the delivery of active travel projects. I understand the recruitment process is ongoing and I hope to see all the staff in place by early 2022. As we emerge from Covid, we have a major opportunity to change the way we travel in this country and I am pleased to say that, despite the challenges of Covid as well as the need to recruit additional staff in the local authorities, it is expected that 80% of the total active travel financial allocation will be spent by the end of this year.	spk_188
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Cycling Facilities	dbsect_30	I think €287 million or quarter of a billion euro is a significant figure, especially in the context of Covid-19, given that greenways, which are part of this, were not considered essential works during the lockdown. That may have brought the figure down slightly but as the resources are allocated to local authorities in relation to active travel projects, we will see - and we will monitor this - an increase year on year in the roll-out of active travel infrastructure. I note what the Deputy says on rural towns and villages. It is important to say that additional funding of €72 million was announced in March for 340 sustainable transport projects in 19 local authorities outside the greater Dublin area in our regional cities. The NTA originally earmarked €50 million for the scheme but it was increased due to the volume of proposals. That shows there is an appetite to roll these out in our regional cities, towns and villages. I encourage local authorities to continue to do that but we need to resource those authorities around that.	spk_190
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Cycling Facilities	dbsect_30	Absolutely. It is said by people who engage in and spearhead cycle buses that hopefully one day we will not need them and will have safe routes to school and protected infrastructure such that parents feel confident to let their children cycle to school appropriately. What is important about the safe routes to school programme is that the schools are actively involved in these solutions. It is not just the local authority coming in and proposing something outside of the school space. It is the schools working with parents and the real leaders are the students. They say what they require, be it cycle parking or a walk and stride facility. Our commitment is to roll out that €360 million per year on walking and cycling facilities. This is just the start and it will ramp up. If we get good examples in urban, rural and suburban areas that can be replicated across the country, and if leaders roll out schemes in areas where it was thought not to be possible, that will encourage others to do the same.	spk_192
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_31	I thank the Deputy. Providing a sustainable low-carbon transport system is a key priority for the Department. The programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reductions to 2030. Ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050 and electrification will be key to achieving that in the transport sector. EVs are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 climate action plan and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. To this end, my Department has convened the electric vehicle policy pathway working group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The working group comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial and taxation policies to help to drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.  Scrappage schemes were discussed as part of these considerations. The working group considered the potential of this incentive but concluded that a general scrappage scheme would entail significant additional costs. However, the group concluded that niche market scrappage schemes could potentially play an important role, such as in the small public service vehicles, SPSV, sector. Furthermore, considerable progress has been made as a result of the work of the low-emission vehicle task force to ensure conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. A comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and benefit-in-kind tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have contributed to increased take-up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to around 45,000	spk_194
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_31	The Deputy made some valid points in relation to looking at other areas. Preparations are under way to establish an office of low emissions vehicles. This office will play an important role in our transition to zero-emission vehicles and will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the roll-out of charge point infrastructure. In the context of rural Ireland, we spoke about Connecting Ireland, which concerns a public transport system across rural Ireland, but we have to be realistic. We will not have public transport in every area of rural Ireland. It is not feasible. We know this clearly. We need to look at ways to help people to move to a more environmentally friendly vehicle. I would like to see the office of low emissions vehicle looking at that. The move to electric vehicles will be a critical part in emissions reduction.	spk_196
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-11-04	dail	33	Electric Vehicles	dbsect_31	I agree that we must consider targeted measures based on service provision across the country. There will be people who will need a private car. The evidence is there regarding emissions reductions with electric vehicles. In particular where people have no other alternative, we must look at measures in that respect. I will not go into the grants. Deputy Duncan Smith is very well aware that there is going to be a concerted public service element as well, including for taxis. The public sector is leading the way. An Post, for example, has invested hugely in electric vehicles for its fleet. We must lead as well, but also look at supports and targeted incentives for certain sectors and regions that may need extra help.	spk_198

The temporary standing down of Doolin Coast Guard unit operations is a proportionate response having regard to significant ongoing attempts by the Irish Coast Guard to address the unfortunate differences that have existed within the unit and their impact on the unit. Equally, the recent resignations of several Doolin Coast Guard volunteers have contributed to this decision.The key objective is to ensure the safety of the volunteers. The action is being taken in compliance with the search and rescue assurance obligations set out in the national search and rescue plan. As regards contingency plans, I have been advised by my officials that these are fully in place. The Inis Oírr Coast Guard unit, which falls under the direct management of the Doolin unit, shall continue to remain fully operational. In the interim, the Coast Guard is liaising with other search and rescue stakeholders in the area to provide full cover for services that otherwise would be provided by the Doolin unit. The Coast Guard is currently deploying various contingencies based on an assessment of risk within the area, and in particular Kilkee and Killaloe Coast Guard units. All other Coast Guard units, shoreline and cliff rescue services remain in place, along with the four search and rescue Coast Guard helicopters. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, community rescue boats and Naval Service will continue to assist, particularly in those areas of greatest risk, until the issue has been resolved. The Coast Guard and the Department have taken these unfortunate differences within the Doolin unit volunteers extremely seriously and have consistently striven over the past number of years to try to assist in the repair of the breakdown in relationships that have occurred within the unit. These actions include: dignity and respect training for the Doolin unit; a number of facilitated group meetings with the unit; one-to-one sessions with Irish Coast Guard management and the Doolin unit members; and an independent investigation by a HR consultancy with subsequent report and follow-up actions and recommendations. Follow-up actions included an intensive support package put in place with the coastal unit sector manager attending training sessions weekly in Doolin to monitor and assist in supervising the situation. Unfortunately, during the period of March 2020 to April 2021, there were limitations on volunteer training due to Covid restrictions. Confidential counselling services are also contracted by the Coast Guard and are readily available to all volunteers who wish to avail of these services. The Irish Coast Guard very much acknowledges and recognises the strenuous efforts and leadership displayed by many members of the unit, its management team and other stakeholders to address these difficulties. The Irish Coast Guard will continue to offer support to all those affected by this event with the aim of strengthening the unit's management structure and providing relevant training and mediation services as may be required. The Irish Coast Guard is committed to supporting the near 900 dedicated volunteers who help provide the important and life-saving services of the Coast Guard. Ongoing consultation with Coast Guard volunteers is key to the success of the Coast Guard. For this reason, Coast Guard volunteers have for some time had a representative body called the Coastal Unit Advisory Group. This group represents Irish Coast Guard volunteers and provides advice and input to the Coast Guard under agreed terms of reference between management and the volunteers. This group meets regularly and is involved in working with Coast Guard management to deliver a world-class service while protecting the safety and well-being of the volunteers within the Coast Guard units. My office has been in touch with the Coastal Unit Advisory Group with a view to arranging a meeting shortly.	spk_323

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-10-07	dail	33	Recovery of Tourism and Aviation: Statements	dbsect_35	I am glad to have this opportunity to update the House on the recovery of aviation, which is a key supporting element in the recovery of tourism that the Minister has just outlined. The Government is very much alive to the challenges faced by both sectors and has proven its commitment to their recovery through the various strategic and financial supports provided to date. I am pleased to report that we are seeing some positive trends towards recovery in Irish aviation but there is still some distance to go. Much still depends on the international Covid context, global vaccination rates and the return of consumer confidence in respect of safe air travel. I take this opportunity to touch upon two other key developments which will impact aviation during the recovery ahead: the domestic regulatory reform process to establish a single aviation regulator in Ireland; and the sustainability challenge faced by the sector in responding to the EU's recent commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 55% by 2030. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, my officials and I have remained in close contact with key stakeholders in the aviation sector.It was clear from this engagement that the single most important factor for Irish aviation was the reopening of international travel, subject to public health considerations. This reopening began on 19 July, following a period of extensive preparation and collaboration between Departments, industry and international partners. Central to this was the substantial work undertaken to introduce the enhanced passenger locator form and the EU digital Covid certificate. Under these arrangements, we have seen a very welcome recovery in passenger numbers, with throughput at the State airports in mid-September up nearly 300% on the levels of 19 July. However, passenger numbers at Irish airports are running at around 50% of pre-pandemic levels, compared with an average of 70% at other European airports. I am hopeful this will improve shortly and there are positive signs in this respect. The news that Ryanair will reopen its Cork Airport base from December, which secures 60 jobs, is very welcome. We have seen the limited return of Aer Lingus to Shannon on the London to Heathrow route and its recent announcement of the phased reintroduction of numerous European routes from Dublin this winter is another welcome development. The news of the intended relaxation of US travel rules for vaccinated European travellers from November means we can look forward to an increase in transatlantic traffic over the coming months. The announced return of both American Airlines and United Airlines to Shannon is a further positive development, particularly as transatlantic connectivity is key to many commercial activities in the mid-west region, as well as serving as a boon to our tourism and hospitality sector. Much of the recovery in passenger numbers has been driven by our successful vaccination programme and those of our European neighbours. At this stage, approximately 90% of incoming passengers completing the electronic passenger locator form are fully vaccinated. Ireland's reputation as a safe destination is also enhanced by our impressive vaccination figures and our position at the top of the Bloomberg Covid resilience ranking. This is a vindication of Ireland's careful approach to Covid-19 and international travel and I am confident this approach will reap benefits from here on in. We cannot underplay, however, the seriousness of the impact that Covid has had on the aviation sector. The industry is emerging from its greatest ever crisis and it needed substantial support throughout this time to remain resilient. Here again, the Government was not found wanting. From the beginning of the pandemic, the Government has taken strong and targeted action with a broad range of unprecedented Exchequer supports to help mitigate the effects of the crisis, including a wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, a commercial rates waiver and deferred tax liabilities. It is estimated that Irish airlines and airports will have availed of over €440 million through several of the available supports by the end of 2021. In addition, through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund, DAA secured €40 million and Aer Lingus secured €150 million. In November 2020, a dedicated funding package for Irish aviation totalling €80 million was announced. This package included the regional airports programme, which provides over €21 million for 2021 to Ireland West, Donegal and Kerry airports and supports the operation of our public service obligation air service between Donegal and Dublin. The Covid-19 regional State airports programme for 2021 provides €32 million to Cork and Shannon airports. A €26 million Covid supplementary supports scheme will compensate airport operators towards the losses caused by Covid-19 and the travel restrictions imposed to limit its spread. This saw €20 million in compensation disbursed to Dublin, Cork, and Shannon, providing the State airports with flexibility to roll out route incentives and charge rebates in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity. Of the total, €6 million was provided for Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West airports. I assure Deputies that the Government is keeping under review the need for any additional targeted supports to this vital sector. Deputies will be aware that the economic recovery plan published by the Government on 1 June explicitly references this and recognises that additional supports may be required to support the aviation sector's recovery as it reopens. International travel is vital for the continued economic well-being of this country and maintaining its recovery, and it will continue to remain a priority for the Government. Supports needed to help all regional airports, including Shannon and Cork, are being considered in the context of budget 2022. I recently wrote to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the provision of support for the licensed travel trade in light of continuing uncertainty for that sector. The travel trade is expected to be one of the last to recover from the impact of the pandemic. Consumer confidence remains unstable and the industry has forecast that most bookings in 2021 will relate to 2022 and that trade will not recover to any meaningful extent until that year at the earliest. The availability of general wage supports undoubtedly sustained many small businesses over the course of the pandemic but the risk of insolvencies has re-emerged now that travel agents and tour operators are falling outside eligibility for the Covid restrictions support scheme since the more general reopening of non-essential retail from 17 May. That is despite low levels of holiday booking. Support for this sector is support for small business and I will continue to advocate for it in discussions with my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. As the aviation sector continues to recover from the Covid-19 crisis, we must ensure we have a robust regulatory regime to sustain the recovery. The Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020, which is moving through the legislative process, will provide this. Whereas the current regulatory regime was put in place in the early 1990s, and has served the sector well over time, the institutional structures no longer reflect international best practice. This Bill therefore proposes to put in place a modern regulatory system that will underpin Irish aviation for the next decade and more. This Bill has three main objectives. First, it merges the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority with those of the Commission for Aviation Regulation. In doing so, it establishes a single, independent and strengthened aviation regulator. Second, it establishes a new commercial semi-State company to manage the air traffic control requirements of Irish controlled airspace, AirNav Ireland. Third, it makes changes to how airport charges are set at Dublin Airport by putting a greater emphasis on the needs and expectations of the consumer. As Deputies will be aware, recovery from Covid cannot come at the expense of the climate and the aviation sector in particular is conscious of the need for a sustainable recovery in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and the EU's commitment to reduce overall carbon emissions by 55% by 2030. I am happy to advise that Dublin Airport was formally designated as level 3+ carbon-neutral in December 2020 by the global Airport Carbon Accreditation programme and is the first airport in Ireland to achieve carbon-neutral status. All Irish airports are encouraged to sign up to Airports Council International, ACI, Europe's carbon accreditation programme and, where feasible, the regional airports programme will seek to support eligible airports to achieve goals in this respect. In addition, officials in my Department are also engaged in the negotiation of several key files at EU level as part of the EU's Fit for 55 package. These measures aim to address the sustainability challenge for aviation but will require efforts and investments by both airlines and airports. I fully recognise that the need to meet this sustainability challenge is coming at a time when the sector is trying to regain its footing but the aviation sector is nothing if not innovative. I am confident that the supports and commitments to the sector provided by the Government will position it to rise to the dual challenge of recovering in a sustainable manner.	spk_239

The Government will continue to support eligible regional airports under the regional airports programme to support connectivity and ensure safety, security and climate-related efficiency and resilience at these airports. All airports plan to invest in sustainability projects and moving towards carbon neutrality which is very welcome as we look to the future.

The Minister for Transport has responsibility for overall policy and securing Exchequer funding for the national roads programme. Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Tll, under the Roads Acts, 1993 to 2015, and in line with the NDP, the planning, design, improvement and upgrading of individual national roads is a matter for Tll, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Tll ultimately delivers the national roads programme in line with Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework, and the NDP. In the new NDP, launched on 4 October, approximately €5.1 billion is earmarked for new national road projects to 2030. This funding will enable improved connectivity across the country as well as compact growth, which are core components of the revised NDP. The funding will enable the development of numerous national road projects, including the completion of projects at construction stage and those close to it, as well as the development of many others. The N6 Galway city ring road is one of the projects included in the new NDP, which is currently at the planning application stage. The proposed project around Galway city comprises 12.5 km of motorway and 6 km of single carriageway. The route would run between the existing N6 at Coolagh to the existing Ballymoneen Road and continues as a single carriageway road for a further 5 km of protected road, west of Barna. The new orbital route would travel around the city and include a new bridge crossing of the River Corrib. An oral hearing commenced on 18 February 2020 and concluded on 4 November 2020, inclusive of a seven-month gap in proceedings due to Covid-19 restrictions. Galway County Council is awaiting a decision from An Bord Pleanála, which has recently been pushed back to a decision by a new target date of 19 November 2021. If planning approval is received from An Bord Pleanála and there are no legal challenges, the proposed project will require Government approval under the public spending code to proceed to the next stage, including procurement of a contractor, given that the project cost is expected to be more than €100 million. It would also be subject to final Government approval in advance of construction. As the Deputy said, this project is a key component of the Galway transport strategy, which realises Galway city and county councils' vision of all elements of transport working together to achieve an integrated, sustainable transport system. The project would, as the Deputy said, free up road space in the city by removing through traffic for use by improved public transport services and active travel modes, while improving air quality and reducing noise levels in the city. As the principal economic centre of the west, Galway city is critical to employment in the region and this project would contribute towards ensuring the city is able to cater for future economic expansion and development. As a gateway to Connemara and the western region, which includes large Gaeltacht areas, the optimisation of transport connectivity within Galway city will be essential to help the region chart a steady course for economic growth. The additional bridge crossing of the Corrib will provide this accessibility to the west. By reducing traffic volumes on the existing road network, this proposed project will drastically improve journey times and allow for safer and more reliable journeys for road users. It will improve the existing collision rating, which currently stands at twice the average rate in the country. The project will provide direct access to major employment centres at Parkmore and Ballybrit business parks, and offers an opportunity to execute the vision of the Galway transport strategy. Galway County Council has an advanced negotiating strategy in place for the proposed Galway city ring road. All affected householders were invited to participate and discussions and negotiations have been ongoing with those willing to participate since mid-2019. If the scheme is approved and confirmed, the council will prioritise the acquisition and agreements associated with the affected residential properties.	spk_281

We will then proceed to the next stage, procurement of a contractor. Given that the project will cost in excess of €100 million, it will require further Government approval. There is another process under the national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, which involves four priorities, all of which are given equal weight and ranking. The first priority is to ensure that roads have regional connectivity, the second is decarbonisation and another is to ensure the mobility of goods and people in our urban centres. All of these are taken into consideration when looking at projects. I will give the Deputy more information and I will relay his questions to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.	spk_293

The project would, as the Deputy said, free up road space in the city by removing through traffic for use by improved public transport services and active travel modes, while improving air quality and reducing noise levels in the city. As the principal economic centre of the west, Galway city is critical to employment in the region and this project would contribute towards ensuring the city is able to cater for future economic expansion and development. As a gateway to Connemara and the western region, which includes large Gaeltacht areas, the optimisation of transport connectivity within Galway city will be essential to help the region chart a steady course for economic growth. The additional bridge crossing of the Corrib will provide this accessibility to the west. By reducing traffic volumes on the existing road network, this proposed project will drastically improve journey times and allow for safer and more reliable journeys for road users. It will improve the existing collision rating, which currently stands at twice the average rate in the country. The project will provide direct access to major employment centres at Parkmore and Ballybrit business parks, and offers an opportunity to execute the vision of the Galway transport strategy. Galway County Council has an advanced negotiating strategy in place for the proposed Galway city ring road. All affected householders were invited to participate and discussions and negotiations have been ongoing with those willing to participate since mid-2019. If the scheme is approved and confirmed, the council will prioritise the acquisition and agreements associated with the affected residential properties.	spk_281

If planning approval is received from An Bord Pleanála and there are no legal challenges, the proposed project will then require Government approval under the public spending code to proceed to the next stage. That will include procurement of a contractor. Given that the project will cost more than €100 million, it will also be subject to final Government approval in advance of construction. I can ask the Minister to come back to the Deputy on the sequencing of approvals, if this project is approved by An Bord Pleanála.	spk_283

Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic impacted the timeline for this vital regional project. As I said, the oral hearing commenced on 18 February 2020 and concluded on 4 November 2020 due to a seven-month gap in proceedings as a result of Covid. I am confident that An Bord Pleanála will make its decision next month and I am hopeful for a positive outcome. The programme for Government commits to a 2:1 ratio of spending on new public transports over new roads. This commitment has been confirmed in the NDP, published this week, which makes clear that substantial funding will be made available over the coming decade for new national road programmes and projects. As the principal economic centre in the west, Galway city is critical to employment in the region and this project would contribute towards ensuring the city is able to cater for future economic expansion and development.	spk_286

If this project is approved by An Bord Pleanála and if there are no legal challenges, the next step is to seek Government approval, as required under the public spending code. We will then proceed to the next stage, procurement of a contractor. Given that the project will cost in excess of €100 million, it will require further Government approval. There is another process under the national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, which involves four priorities, all of which are given equal weight and ranking. The first priority is to ensure that roads have regional connectivity, the second is decarbonisation and another is to ensure the mobility of goods and people in our urban centres. All of these are taken into consideration when looking at projects. I will give the Deputy more information and I will relay his questions to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.	spk_293
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-10-06	dail	33	Hospital Services	dbsect_3	I thank Deputy Carey for raising this important issue. I acknowledge what a tragedy the Whiddy Island disaster was and express my deepest sympathies to those who died and the families they left behind. A tribunal of inquiry was established in April 1979, with the High Court judge, Mr. Justice Declan Costello, being appointed to lead the inquiry. A number of public hearings with oral testimony were conducted throughout 1979 and Mr. Justice Costello submitted his report in May 1980. The report concluded that a number of factors contributed to the disaster, including the poor condition of the French-registered oil tanker, along with Gulf Oil not following the correct safety procedures and a lack of regulation of the safety of oil jetties. The then Minister for Labour put in place the Dangerous Substances (Oil Jetties) Regulations in 1979, which regulate the safety of oil jetties in the State. I understand there have been further developments in this area with the Health and Safety Authority publishing its code of practice for health and safety in dock work in 2016, which addresses safety arrangements at oil jetties. Given the broad range of issues involved across a number of Departments, the original report into the inquiry and any subsequent documentation will need to be reviewed in light of any request received from the families and a consensus reached across Government Departments on specific issues raised. Separately, it is important to note that the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, was only established as an independent body following the enactment of the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000, with a mandate to examine and, if necessary, carry out investigations into all types of marine casualties to, or on board, Irish-registered vessels worldwide and other vessels in Irish territorial waters and inland waterways.  The Deputy will be aware that on 9 July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, issued a judgment concerning the independence of the MCIB and the findings have since been addressed through the resignation of two board numbers in July last year and the introduction of amending regulations under the European Communities Act 1972. While these actions addressed the CJEU ruling from an EU perspective, separate revision of the 2000 Act is required to facilitate the appointment of new members of the MCIB. Drafting of the Bill to amend the Act of 2000 is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to progress the publication of the Bill in the coming period as a part of the Government's autumn legislative programme. Separately, an independent review of the organisational structures for marine casualty investigation in Ireland was initiated in March of this year. The key objective of the review is to assess the current organisational structures for marine casualty investigation and to set out in a report any recommendations to achieve the most appropriate and effective marine casualty investigation structures for Ireland, taking into account national, EU and international obligations. Following a competitive tender process, Clinchmaritime Limited was selected to undertake the review and tasked to report back to the Minister for Transport with recommendations on how Ireland should approach marine casualty investigations going forward. Clinchmaritime Limited is headed by Captain Steve Clinch, a former chief inspector of marine accidents in the UK's marine accident investigation branch who has experience working at a high level in EU and international capacities relating to marine casualty investigations. Captain Clinch began the review process in late March and a report on the review of organisational structures underpinning marine casualty investigation in Ireland has been submitted to my Department and is currently being examined.	spk_5

In regard to meeting the Whiddy Island families, I would of course be happy to meet them, as would the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, if any request was made to my office to do so. I again want to say that any request from the families will of course be considered by all Departments involved, taking account of the report of the tribunal of inquiry and any subsequent information available. Maritime safety is a key concern of my Department. There have been great changes in the maritime sector generally in terms of technology and updated safety procedures over the past number of years. My Department is committed to ensuring the safety of the sector and all of those who work in it. More recently, a review of maritime regulations was undertaken in 2020 and earlier this year my Department published its strategy for the next five years for the Irish Maritime Directorate, which includes actions to progress the development of maritime safety legislation. Work is ongoing with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on an amendment to the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000, which was subject to extensive pre-legislative scrutiny earlier this year. It is hoped to progress this Bill through the autumn session.  As I also mentioned, the independent report into the organisational structures underpinning marine casualty investigation in Ireland is currently being considered by my Department. It is worth noting that, simultaneous to the review, officials in the Department of Transport ran a public consultation between March and May of this year and the submissions received on foot of this consultation were provided in full to Captain Clinch to inform his review. Finally, I would like to once again express my sincere condolences to those affected by the Whiddy Island disaster.	spk_7
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-10-06	dail	33	Hospital Services	dbsect_3	I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. I would like to clarify that the provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage supports fire authorities by establishing policy, setting national standards for fire safety and fire service provision, providing essential training programmes, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.Dublin City Council provides fire prevention and fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authorities. It also provides an emergency ambulance service by arrangement with the National Ambulance Service of the HSE. Local authority fire services in Ireland are provided by 3,200 professional, competent and highly committed personnel at all levels in 217 full-time and retained fire stations. It is important to note that the number of fire service front-line staff has been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of recent years, even when staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in other areas of the local authority sector. Under the Local Government Act 2001, arrangements on staffing in each local authority are the responsibility of the chief executive. With regard to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, I understand that Dublin City Council, as the employer, has engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies Fórsa and SIPTU at the Workplace Relations Commission. Unfortunately, the parties were not able to reach agreement on all the proposals, some of which are intended to alleviate pressures caused by current staffing arrangements. I encourage the parties to continue to use the State's established statutory industrial relations machinery to resolve the issues concerned. Also in respect of staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, I am aware that the most recent firefighter recruitment campaign began in September 2019. All recent fire brigade recruit training has taken place in the shadow of the pandemic, which has placed considerable additional challenges on the process. The first class of recruits from that campaign began training in April 2020 and have taken up positions across the brigade. A second recruit class began training in June 2021 and will finish this December to take up positions across the brigade in January 2022. A third recruit class will begin training early in February 2022, with a start date for a fourth and final class of the remaining panelled recruits currently under review. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage funds new fire appliances and specialist equipment under national procurement programmes. Dublin City Council was allocated four new class-B fire appliances in the latest appliance procurement programme, at an approximate cost of €1.9 million. Dublin City Council was also grant-aided to procure three class-B fire appliances in both the 2015 and 2017 programmes. Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet is one of the key national priorities for the fire services capital programme. Dublin City Council received approval in 2018 to purchase six four-wheel drive vehicles for €170,000. In July 2019, the council received approval to purchase a new turntable ladder or aerial appliance, at a cost of €800,000 plus VAT. In September 2021, Dublin City Council requested approval for the purchase of a new turntable ladder, at a cost of €850,000. This application is under consideration by the Department and is likely to be approved in the immediate future. The provision of enhanced communications and mobilisation systems for fire services across the country, including in Dublin, has also been proceeding over the past several years. The Ctrí project is delivering the next generation of communications and mobilisation systems for local authority fire services. All fire station equipment and radio communication terminals in fire service vehicles across the country, including Dublin, have been replaced successfully with digital equipment. While the current three regional systems have operated successfully since the early 1990s, the replacement of first-generation mobilisation technology is enabling us to develop enhanced resilience for 999 calls.	spk_10
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-10-06	dail	33	Hospital Services	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputies again for raising the issue. Bearing in mind the concerns the Deputies have raised, there are several important points I would like to finish on to put the circumstances into context. The prioritisation of work and effective management of all resources is, in the first instance, a matter for management in each of the fire services, based on their assessment of local risk, needs and resources. On the staffing requirements in each local authority, under the Local Government Act 2001 it is the responsibility of the chief executive to employ required staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of his or her local authority. I encourage both staff and management sides to use the industrial relations machinery of the State to resolve the issues under discussion, which affect the optimal use of financial and staffing resources in protecting and keeping communities safe in Dublin. Since the onset of Covid-19, the Department has monitored regular reports from fire services regarding the impact the pandemic has had on staffing levels. During this period, necessary restrictions have limited opportunities for some fire services to undertake recruitment and training activities. However, recruitment, training and deployment of new recruits have continued in Dublin Fire Brigade. There is little doubt that fire services in Ireland, including Dublin, are provided with the best of equipment to undertake the difficult roles they have sometimes been called on to perform. All requests for funding from the fire services capital programme of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are considered promptly and have regard to local authorities' own priorities, consistent with national policy, the value for money offered by proposals, and the totality of requests. I will, however, relay the Deputies' concerns to the Minister.	spk_13

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-10-06	dail	33	The National Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 and Supporting Community Safety: Statements	dbsect_14	I thank the Minister of State, the Ceann Comhairle and Deputies. Community safety is about people being safe and, importantly, feeling safe in their community. At its heart, community safety is the principle that every community has the right to be and feel safe in order to thrive and flourish. Ireland is generally regarded as a safe country in international terms, with relatively low crime rates and a general feeling of safety and security. However, we recognise that this is not always the case in every community and that people living in disadvantaged areas can experience a different reality. The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report recommended that reform of An Garda Síochána be undertaken to free up experienced trained members of An Garda Síochána for front-line policing duties, where their expertise would be most utilised. The report also recommended that community safety be viewed as a whole-of-government responsibility, and it recognised that simply putting more gardaí on the beat does not address the underlying issues that impact on community safety. This is why, under the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, we are advancing a number of reforms to policing in the State, but also putting community safety measures and structures on a statutory footing, as well as recognising in law that community safety is not solely the responsibility of An Garda Síochána. It is the State's responsibility as a whole and each State service has a role to play. The new local community safety partnerships, LCSPs, will, when the Bill is enacted, replace the existing joint policing committee structures. The LCSPs will be supported through a national governance structure and will ensure communities are safer and feel safer by making community safety a whole-of-government responsibility and priority. This structure will ensure that communities are empowered to have a strong say in what actions are prioritised by the services operating in their area, and will also have a key oversight role in ensuring those actions are followed through. This will enable the local community safety partnership to function as a forum for dialogue between the community and service providers, and should strengthen trust in the people providing services. The local community safety partnership will also work to identify specific initiatives where the community can support local services and An Garda Síochána in their community safety work, including outreach programmes. The Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Helen McEntee, agreed in principle to establish a new community safety innovation fund in April of this year. The scheme, when established, will consider applications to allocate funds to community safety projects and other policy initiatives in the area, including the work of the new local community safety partnerships. This fund will reflect the significant successes of An Garda Síochána and the Criminal Assets Bureau in disrupting criminal activity and seizing proceeds of crime by providing additional funding for investment in community safety projects. While State services carry out their individual responsibilities, too often their interventions rely on a reactive response to emergency and crisis situations. The aim of community safety is to focus all relevant Government services on prevention and early interventions, and the impact that a shared approach to problem solving can have in ensuring that situations do not develop to the point where they impact on the safety, or feeling of safety, of the community at large. This will mean State services working with each other and the community to ensure there is better co-ordination between services, such as educational and youth work with young people, the availability of local health and mental health services, drug prevention, housing and the built environment, and actions taken to combat alcohol and substance abuse, domestic abuse, youth crime, antisocial behaviour and hate crime. This approach has had positive results, for example, in Northern Ireland, where policing and community safety partnerships bring together members of the community alongside representatives from policing, probation, housing, youth, emergency and education services. Often, the risk a person poses may be to themselves, but their behaviour can also negatively impact on the sense of safety of those within their community. Ensuring that people in these situations can get the right support at the right time is vital. This means harm prevention and interventions delivered proactively by the service best placed to deliver it, and doing so in a joined-up, integrated way, with other services. This will include addressing individual mental health and addiction needs, services and supports for homeless people, reduction strategies for childhood trauma and ensuring older people and other at-risk groups have access to effective supports and advocates. These are some of the key underlying issues that make communities unsafe or feel unsafe, and dealing with them in an effective way, before they reach the point where an emergency or crisis develops, is central to community safety. Clearly, this approach goes far beyond the traditional policing response and requires all relevant State bodies and voluntary organisations to work together in a joined-up way in partnership with the local community to prioritise and address issues in their own area. Each community's issues will be different and that requires solutions tailored to the needs of that community. The local community safety partnership will be responsible for developing a tailored and prioritised local community safety plan in conjunction with both community and public services. The intention is to build the capacity of local residents to enable them to engage meaningfully in the local community safety partnership and grow local community leadership and participation. Developing this will be a key aspect of the role of the community safety co-ordinator, whose role is to support the partnership, engage the residents in the community on safety issues and link them in with the work of the partnership. There are currently three pilot LCSPs - in Dublin's north inner city, Longford and Waterford - working to develop structures and processes to address the issues mentioned. These pilots will run for two years and the lessons learned from them will inform the eventual roll-out of a community safety partnership in every local authority area. As Deputies will recognise, the Government is committed to improving community safety, not only through increasing the number of gardaí on our streets, but also through giving communities the structures and supports they need to feel safe and be safe. I thank the House for the time to address this issue.	spk_187
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-10-05	dail	33	Proposed Legislation	dbsect_30	I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter and for the opportunity to provide clarity on some issues. The Coroner Service comprises the network of coroners located in districts throughout the country. Coroners are independent quasi-judicial officeholders whose core function is to investigate sudden and unexplained deaths so that a death certificate can be issued. This is an important public service to the living, in particular, to the next-of-kin and friends of the deceased. Coroners not only provide closure for those bereaved, but also perform, as Deputy Ó Laoghaire said, a wider public service by identifying matters of public health and safety concerns. The timing and conduct of inquests in any district is a matter entirely for the coroner concerned. Neither I nor my Department has any function in this regard. Most coroners hold inquests in local court houses, and as a result of Covid-19 public health considerations, inquests have unfortunately been severely curtailed. My Department is aware that the delay in holding inquests is causing distress for families and officials from my Department are liaising with the Courts Service on this matter.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-10-05	dail	33	Proposed Legislation	dbsect_30	I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Improving public transport services and infrastructure is central to improving citizens' quality of life and addressing our climate action challenge, and the Government is committed to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland. As the Government, we need to provide people more options so that they can make the switch to sustainable mobility. Within the national development plan, the Government has committed that MetroLink will be one of those options. MetroLink faces imminent and important milestones in the coming months. These milestones will determine its progress in the coming years. First, there is the Government's approval of the preliminary business case. Second, there is the submission of a railway order application to An Bord Pleanála. There has been no impact on either of these significant milestones in recent days. Regarding the first milestone, the Department of Transport has received the preliminary business case for the project. This represents decision gate No. 1 under the public spending code and indicates that the preliminary business case is currently under review. For major projects like MetroLink, the public spending code requires a Government decision. The Minister expects to seek such a Government decision in the near future. Approval by the Government will allow MetroLink to move into the statutory planning system, subject to the completion of the necessary planning and environmental documentation. The second impending milestone is the submission of the railway order application. That application requires the finalisation of an extensive set of documentation, including environmental impact assessment reports. That work is ongoing. The Minister informed the House recently of his understanding that an extensive body of work remained in terms of finalising the preliminary design, completing the required environmental impact assessment reports and closing out property referencing issues. He stated his understanding that this work would be completed during quarter 1 next year. Subject to the Government decision, the project will then be ready to seek planning permission. The preliminary business cases for BusConnects and DART+ are also being reviewed by the Department. The Minister expects to bring these projects to the Government for approval by the end of the year in line with the requirements of the public spending code. This will allow applications for a railway order for the DART+ West project and planning applications for the BusConnects core bus corridors to be submitted to An Bord Pleanála. In addition to this necessary preparatory work, we are also seeing delivery on the ground. On active travel, we are all aware of the real progress that has been made in rolling out new and improved infrastructure across Dublin. We have seen some fantastic initiatives rolled out across all four Dublin local authority areas and the national development plan will support that in the years ahead. Regarding BusConnects, we have already seen the roll-out of new services, with Howth starting earlier this year and Lucan to start by year's end. I am delighted to say that the reaction to the Howth spine has been positive. The Luas green line capacity enhancement project has been successfully delivered with the delivery of eight new trams and 26 tram extensions. Regarding rail, construction is continuing on the 41 new carriages for the greater Dublin area commuter rail fleet. They will arrive next year and enter into service in 2023. I assure the Deputies that the Government is committed to improving and expanding public transport in Dublin. We have a busy programme ahead of us, but progress is being made and that progress will be supported by the funding secured in the national development plan.	spk_331
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-10-05	dail	33	Proposed Legislation	dbsect_30	I will relay the Deputies' comments to the Minister. I reiterate that the national development plan supports and commits to BusConnects, DART+ and MetroLink. The most important date for MetroLink will be when it secures planning permission. To do that, it needs to enter the planning system and, to do that, it needs Government approval. The focus within the Department is on completing the review of the preliminary business case and secure Government approval. At project level, the focus will be on completing the work needed to submit a planning application. That work will be finished during quarter 1 of 2022. Those are the key dates for this project. We are in a similar position with DART+. The most advanced projects within the overall project are DART+ Fleet and DART+ West. The key focus within the Department is on completing the review of the preliminary business case and the key focus at project level is on finalising the railway order application for DART+ West and the contract negotiations for DART+ Fleet. Public consultation is still ongoing in respect of DART+ West. That will need to finish and the issues raised will need to be considered before the project is ready to enter the planning system. In the meantime, the Minister expects to have brought the preliminary business case to the Government for approval. I again thank the Deputies for the opportunity to address the House on this matter.	spk_334
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-10-05	dail	33	Proposed Legislation	dbsect_30	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan. I thank Deputy Collins for raising the matter of the regulation of horse-drawn carriages for hire and reward within the Dublin area. The Minister has asked me to use this opportunity to outline how this issue came about and to set out the work under way with Dublin City Council to resolve this issue. As stated by the Deputy, in February 2011, Dublin City Council took over from the Garda Carriage Office responsibility for the licensing of horse-drawn carriage operators and drivers. This was achieved through by-laws enacted under Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides a general power to local authorities to make by-laws relating to its property or services or to regulate matters of local concern. It is under this Act that local authorities can choose, using by-laws, to regulate horse-drawn carriages that operate for hire or reward within their functional areas. These by-laws allow relevant local authorities to set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations. In 2018, Dublin City Council became aware that, specifically in the context of Dublin, the legal basis for making by-laws to regulate horse-drawn carriages was uncertain. Local authorities can only use their general by-law making powers for purposes not covered elsewhere in legislation. However, the power to regulate the business of horse-drawn carriages for hire or reward in Dublin was vested exclusively under the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853 to 1855 in the Dublin Metropolitan Police, the predecessor of An Garda Síochána. This is the legislation which gives rise to the lacuna mentioned by the Deputy. Officials in the Department of Transport, in conjunction with colleagues in other Departments and the Office of the Attorney General, investigated the issue in 2019 and determined that the Dublin Carriage Acts would need to be repealed and replaced with legislation that affirms the power of local authorities to regulate this activity. Accordingly, in December 2019, the Government approved a proposal to draft a general scheme to make the necessary repeals and assert the power of local authorities in this area. I should note that this issue relates solely to the power of Dublin City Council to regulate and license the business of horse-drawn carriages. I understand that equine welfare issues are often raised in conjunction with this topic, but I must clarify that equine welfare issues are entirely separate from the licensing lacuna. Animal welfare issues are a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The provisions of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which relate to the welfare of and cruelty to animals, as well as the provisions of the Control of Horses Act 1996, continue to apply irrespective of whether a licensing regime for horse-drawn carriages is in place. Noting that, it had been hoped originally that the licensing issue could have been progressed during 2020. Unfortunately, this was not possible due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and the need to prioritise work associated with the national response to that pandemic. However, I am pleased to report on behalf of Minister, Deputy Ryan, that work on the development of the general scheme resumed this year. Officials in the Department of Transport are working closely with key stakeholders, including Dublin City Council, on the development of the legislation. I recognise that some here today are frustrated by the time taken to resolve this particular issue in Dublin. However, the development of legislation of this nature, particularly when it involves the repeal of legislation which predates the foundation of the State, is complex and technical in nature and it can be quite difficult to give precise timelines for completion. It is also important to ensure nothing in the forthcoming legislative proposals inadvertently disturbs existing regimes elsewhere in the country, such as the long-established regime for jarveys in Killarney and around Killarney National Park. Nevertheless, I have been advised this work is progressing at pace as the number of legal issues left to be resolved is narrowed. Once these issues have been fully clarified, it would be the hope of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, that a general scheme would be published without delay. Naturally, the Minister will be in touch with the Chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications once the general scheme is published with a view to arranging pre-legislative scrutiny and to proceed with the resolution of this legal lacuna once and for all.	spk_336

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-10-05	dail	33	Coroners Service	dbsect_32	I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter and for the opportunity to provide clarity on some issues. The Coroner Service comprises the network of coroners located in districts throughout the country. Coroners are independent quasi-judicial officeholders whose core function is to investigate sudden and unexplained deaths so that a death certificate can be issued. This is an important public service to the living, in particular, to the next-of-kin and friends of the deceased. Coroners not only provide closure for those bereaved, but also perform, as Deputy Ó Laoghaire said, a wider public service by identifying matters of public health and safety concerns. The timing and conduct of inquests in any district is a matter entirely for the coroner concerned. Neither I nor my Department has any function in this regard. Most coroners hold inquests in local court houses, and as a result of Covid-19 public health considerations, inquests have unfortunately been severely curtailed. My Department is aware that the delay in holding inquests is causing distress for families and officials from my Department are liaising with the Courts Service on this matter. The Courts Service works closely with coroners across the country to facilitate inquests and continues to do so while ensuring adherence to public health guidelines.	spk_320

This is an essential tool for law enforcement across the EU and, of course, is of particular value to law enforcement co-operation between Ireland the UK. Deputies will be aware that if Ireland wishes to take part in an EU measure with a legal basis that falls under Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution is required. The Council intends to adopt this measure on 24 September 2021. Therefore, it is necessary to secure Oireachtas approval, as a matter of urgency. In light of this, I ask Deputies to pass this motion without a vote. It is worth noting that this measure provides for the continuation of existing arrangements for a period of nine months, from 1 October 2021, until 30 June 2022, of the time period set out in the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, to share Prüm data. I trust that Deputies understand the urgency and necessity of this motion passing today. It is anticipated that the European Commission will have completed an evaluation of the UK by 30 June 2022 and a mechanism will be the subject of a separate decision, which will come before the Houses in advance of that date. My Department has provided a short note for the attention of the Business Committee, which Deputies will have seen and it provides some background information on this draft Council proposal. I will now give some additional information, which underpins why it is necessary for Ireland to opt into this measure. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement stipulates that member states may continue to supply Prüm data to the United Kingdom, pending the outcome of evaluations required by the TCA, until 30 September 2021. This interim period can be extended once, until 30 June 2022, by the specialised committee on law enforcement and judicial co-operation. An evaluation of the UK by the European Commission, to permit ongoing sharing of Prüm data will not be concluded by the end of September. Consequently, the Commission has published this proposal, in order to facilitate the extension of the period to ensure the continued exchange of Prüm I emphasise that the effective implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is an EU priority and Ireland will play its full part in that. I have previously mentioned that this is a necessary measure to ensure there is no break in the sharing of Prüm I trust that the House can support the exercise of Ireland's opt-in in respect of this measure."	spk_122
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-09-21	dail	33	EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Motion	dbsect_8	I thank the Deputies for their contributions on this motion. A number of specific questions were raised, which I want to address. First, regarding the timing of this proposal, the Commission published its proposal on 27 August, so detailed discussions took place in recent weeks on technical aspects of the proposal. The Department moved as soon as the proposal was published to obtain legal advice and then sought to obtain Government approval. Regarding the evaluation process, the Commission carries out an evaluation of the arrangements the UK has put in place to connect to the Prüm system and that involves an evaluation by the Commission of technical connection, training, security and data protection steps that the UK has put in place. The Commission carries out the evaluation, not the Department. As the UK has already participated in Prüm before Brexit, it is expected that the evaluation will be positive and on time for next June. In relation to our technical capacity, no further preparations are required in Ireland for us to participate, so once the extension is granted, we can continue to exchange and, equally, once the permanent evaluation is completed and agreed, we can take part. Regarding data protection, the Prüm measures include specific and bespoke data protections and in addition, the Commission has adopted an adequacy decision, including strong safeguards for law enforcement data exchange with the UK. This has been subject to consultation with the Parliament. This includes a sunset clause of four years. Prüm is limited to fingerprints, DNA and vehicles. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, these measures are essential to ensure the continued close law enforcement co-operation that Ireland shares with the United Kingdom and it is vital that we meet the highest standards possible when it comes to the investigation and the prosecution of crimes and the ongoing transfer of Prüm data, which will help to ensure that we can do that. This extension allows until 30 June 2022 for the European Commission to complete its evaluation and any further measures will come before the House in advance of that date. On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank all Members for attending today.	spk_132
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-09-16	dail	33	Road Projects	dbsect_18	"The Irish aviation sector is critical to Ireland's economic development by being a key enabler of international trade and business, including foreign direct investment and tourism. However, the impact of Covid-19 on travel is the most challenging crisis in its history. Many analysts are predicting that it will take several years for the sector to return to 2019 levels of activity. While air traffic data for Europe show some recovery, the pace of recovery is still slow in the Irish market, with traffic currently at approximately 50% of 2019 levels. The Government has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including those in the aviation sector. These supports include: the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS; waiving of commercial rates; deferral of tax liabilities; the Covid restrictions support scheme; the credit guarantee scheme; and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, working capital scheme, with some of these now extended to the end of the year. My Department has estimated that Irish airlines and airports have availed of over €300 million through a number of these supports to date. Furthermore, liquidity funding has been provided through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund, bringing funding to almost €500 million. As regards supports specifically targeted at the protection of employment, the EWSS has been a key component of the Government's response to Covid-19 and has been extended to the end of the year. In November 2020, in recognition of the difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of €80 million specifically for Irish aviation. The European Commission has approved, under state aid rules, a €26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by Covid-19. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I have continued to engage with all aviation stakeholders throughout the Covid crisis, including through the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, NCADF. Separately, the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, brings together representatives of employers and trade unions with Ministers to discuss economic, employment and labour market issues. The LEEF has played an important role during the crisis. In March, a LEEF aviation subgroup was established to consider the needs of the sector. I chair this subgroup and it has held five meetings since March, most recently on 14 September.
               The Government's economic recovery plan, published on 1 June, recognised that further targeted supports may be required later in 2021 to assist the restoration of Ireland's air links and to protect jobs in the sector, and my officials are currently considering options in this area. Most of the recommendations from the aviation recovery task force's final report of July 2020 and the NCADF aviation restart plan of April 2021 have been progressed insofar as practicably possible.

The EU digital Covid certification system has been successfully introduced in Ireland, wage subsidies have been extended, other targeted financial supports have been made available, slot alleviation measures for airlines have been implemented, and EU Aviation Safety Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control protocols for safe air travel have been fully implemented. My Department will forward a report to the Deputy, in tabular format, on the status of the implementation of each of the recommendations from both reports.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-09-16	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_19	"The Irish aviation sector is critical to Ireland's economic development by being a key enabler of international trade and business, including foreign direct investment and tourism. However, the impact of Covid-19 on travel is the most challenging crisis in its history. Many analysts are predicting that it will take several years for the sector to return to 2019 levels of activity. While air traffic data for Europe show some recovery, the pace of recovery is still slow in the Irish market, with traffic currently at approximately 50% of 2019 levels. The Government has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including those in the aviation sector. These supports include: the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS; waiving of commercial rates; deferral of tax liabilities; the Covid restrictions support scheme; the credit guarantee scheme; and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, working capital scheme, with some of these now extended to the end of the year. My Department has estimated that Irish airlines and airports have availed of over €300 million through a number of these supports to date. Furthermore, liquidity funding has been provided through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund, bringing funding to almost €500 million. As regards supports specifically targeted at the protection of employment, the EWSS has been a key component of the Government's response to Covid-19 and has been extended to the end of the year. In November 2020, in recognition of the difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of €80 million specifically for Irish aviation. The European Commission has approved, under state aid rules, a €26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by Covid-19. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I have continued to engage with all aviation stakeholders throughout the Covid crisis, including through the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, NCADF. Separately, the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, brings together representatives of employers and trade unions with Ministers to discuss economic, employment and labour market issues. The LEEF has played an important role during the crisis. In March, a LEEF aviation subgroup was established to consider the needs of the sector. I chair this subgroup and it has held five meetings since March, most recently on 14 September.
               The Government's economic recovery plan, published on 1 June, recognised that further targeted supports may be required later in 2021 to assist the restoration of Ireland's air links and to protect jobs in the sector, and my officials are currently considering options in this area. Most of the recommendations from the aviation recovery task force's final report of July 2020 and the NCADF aviation restart plan of April 2021 have been progressed insofar as practicably possible. For example, non-essential international travel was permitted to resume on 19 July. The EU digital Covid certification system has been successfully introduced in Ireland, wage subsidies have been extended, other targeted financial supports have been made available, slot alleviation measures for airlines have been implemented, and EU Aviation Safety Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control protocols for safe air travel have been fully implemented.

Covid-19 has had a profound effect on the delivery of these services, which must comply with occupational and public health guidelines. Fewer daily tests can now be conducted due to social distancing and priority is given to essential workers and then to those who have had tests cancelled due to Covid. In line with the gradual reopening of services this summer, driving tests for all those who are eligible to take the test and have been waiting longest have now recommenced. Critical front-line workers continue to be the priority for the driver testing services. The latest figures available to Sunday, 12 September, show, in spite of the Covid challenges, 101,870 tests have been offered and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, has delivered 92,672 driving tests in 2021. It is highly significant that no Covid case has been attributed to the driving test. My Department is liaising with the RSA on an ongoing basis to meet the growing demand for tests. The RSA has a complement of 100 permanent driver testers. An additional 40 temporary driver testers have been authorised, along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020. There is an average of 3,254 tests conducted per week and the number of tests scheduled is increasing on a gradual basis. However, it has be noted that approximately 5% of all tests scheduled are not conducted or are abandoned on the day for a number of reasons, such as the driver not having NCT certification or adequate insurance.

This motion is an attempt to damage him, not because of the error he made, which should not have happened and for which he repeatedly apologised, but to sow division among the Government parties. Our citizens demand and deserve that their parliamentarians work on issues that matter to them. This motion is a distraction from that important work. It is very clear that in our first week back here in Dáil Éireann, Sinn Féin is prioritising making personal attacks rather than focusing on the important issues that matter to people. As colleagues have stated here this evening, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is a politician of vast experience, ability and integrity. He has been deservedly praised for his careful handling of Brexit and his relationships with the EU and its institutions. He has helped to ensure that Ireland's interests and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement were at the heart of the Brexit negotiations. His tireless work in Northern Ireland in restoring the institutions there has been also widely praised. If Sinn Féin Members were honest, they would admit that he acted at all times with integrity and honesty. I have seen at first hand his dedication to public service. In late December last year, including on Christmas Eve, instead of spending time with his family, he worked with me and colleagues across Government to ensure Irish citizens were not stranded abroad at Christmas due to the necessary restrictions that were brought in as a result of Covid-19. At all times, the interests of the Irish people were at the forefront of his response. However, Sinn Féin's view is that the Minister made a mistake and should be punished by hounding him out of office. It is such hypocrisy. Some Sinn Féin Members of this House have made very public mistakes, by making offensive and divisive statements in public and on social media, but, after apologising, they remained in their positions. Is it Sinn Féin's contention that only its Members can apologise and move on but Members of other parties must be pilloried before this House? There has been much written about Sinn Féin appointing its own members to various boards. Is that not cronyism? Sinn Féin Members know that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, should not resign. They do not want him to do so. That is because they know there is no one within their own ranks who has the ability to deliver for Ireland on the world stage. What they want is to cause friction within Government and within the coalition parties. There is no greater good being served by this motion, which is a classic example of ""Do what I say but not what I do"". This underlines the cynicism at the heart of today's motion. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, entered politics to make a positive difference in people's lives. He still has that focus. Politics should be about implementing policies that make the lives of citizens better, not about personality. It should be about the good we can do, not the damage we can inflict when the occasion arises. I urge the House to support the Government motion."	spk_307

Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 ""Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation"" in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - 'Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection'.2.

Including such matters as:- Identification and description of defect, - Nature of defect — design, product, workmanship, - Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage, - Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling, - Period of construction affected, - Type of dwelling affected, - Location of dwellings affected.3. Establish the scale of the issue - estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.- In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.5. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners' management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings, - Efficient means of carrying out work, - individual dwellings or whole building approach, - routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation, - Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution - advice and support.6. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.7. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.8.

Launched on Monday, the programme provides tangible evidence of the Government's strong commitment to providing quality work experience and training opportunities for jobseekers, in particular, those whose jobs were permanently lost due to the pandemic.  The Government is putting in place a wide range of measures to support people whose jobs will not return after Covid-19 to help them find new jobs in new sectors of the economy. This work placement experience programme is such one such measure.  Apprenticeships and work placement programmes are proven and recognised internationally to be very effective in providing an opportunity for unemployed people to get on-the-job experience, improve their employment prospects and to get new jobs. Such approaches are supported by the EU under its recommendation on post-Covid labour market recovery and its effective active support to employment, EASE, and by our labour market advisory council. These programmes give relevant on-the-job experience and the confidence to find future employment.  The work placement experience programme is an entirely new scheme and is much different from schemes which went before it. The focus of this programme is on quality placements, accredited training and development and a higher payment rate than previous schemes, at €10.20 per hour for 30 hours work per week. Importantly, participation in the scheme will be completely voluntary. The payment rate of €306 per week is equivalent to open labour market rates and will provide six months' work experience with in-built training opportunities to 10,000 people. Training opportunities will comprise 60 hours per placement and 20 of those hours will be accredited. Persons who have been unemployed for six months, including time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment, will be eligible to participate in this programme.  The personal weekly rate will make the offering very attractive for young people, for whom some 4,000 places have been ring-fenced. Many young people whose employment has been especially adversely affected by Covid-19 will see this new programme as an excellent opportunity to improve their skills, get on-the-job experience and give them the confidence to find new employment opportunities. Stringent safeguards are being introduced with this programme to guard against any abuses. Each participant will have a case officer assigned to him or her. There will monthly compliance checks and two review visits during the course of each placement. All roles will be quality-checked in advance to ensure there is a training and development aspect to the role. The work placement experience programme is a very positive initiative and I encourage jobseekers and businesses to engage with it.	spk_297
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-07-15	dail	33	Departmental Funding	dbsect_36	This strategy aims to get people back to work as the economy and the labour market recover from Covid-19. Pathways to Work 2021-2025 is a strategy that sets out 83 whole-of-government commitments aimed at reducing unemployment to or below pre-pandemic 2019 levels. A key commitment under the strategy is the new work placement experience programme. This active labour market programme provides quality training and work experience opportunities for jobseekers out of work for six months or more to learn new skills in the workplace and to help them find new jobs. I have already outlined - I will do so again - that this work placement experience programme is different from earlier versions. It is positive that we can always strive to improve schemes and programmes. These will be quality placements involving accredited training and development and a higher payment rate than previous schemes of €10.20 per hour for 30 hours per week. Importantly, participation in the scheme will be completely voluntary and that point is very important. Nobody has to participate in this scheme. If you do not want to participate and decide not to do so, there will be no impact on your social welfare payments. I believe, however, that the programme will prove very attractive to many people. The payment rate of €306 per week is equivalent to open labour market rates. It equates to €10.20 per hour. The programme will provide six months' work experience with in-built training opportunities for 10,000 people. The training opportunities comprise 60 hours per placement, of which 20 hours will be accredited. Of course, there need to be appropriate safeguards such as stringent measures in place to include advance checks on placements, confirmation of training plans, monthly compliance checks and case officer engagement with the host and with the jobseeker over the six-month period.

She sends her apologies for not being in the Chamber for this debate. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented challenge across our health services and none more so than in our nursing homes. The National Public Health Emergency Team, the Department, the HSE and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, placed a focus on supporting older people in nursing homes throughout the pandemic. Quality care and patient safety is a priority and our continued focus is, and will always be, to deliver safe and high-quality services. From the start of the pandemic, the HSE, through the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, has developed an extensive body of guidance and support tools to assist in the management of Covid-19 cases, including in relation to decisions on transfer of patients and residents between care facilities, where appropriate. The decision to discharge patients from hospitals to nursing home settings is always subject to clinical assessment. Discharges to nursing homes and other settings are a regular, daily feature of a functioning health system. The period from early March 2020 to mid-April 2020 saw an increase in the number of such discharged patients as the health system prepared itself for an expected surge in Covid-19 cases. From an older person's perspective, being admitted for longer than necessary increases the risk of a patient contracting a healthcare associated infection or deconditioning. The vast majority of these discharges took place from 10 March 2020 onwards, when clear public health guidance was in place across all acute hospitals. On 10 March 2020, the HSE issued interim guidance on transfer between care facilities, which included preliminary guidance on the transfer of hospitalised patients from an acute hospital to a residential care facility in the context of the pandemic. This guidance was circulated to all acute hospitals, community healthcare organisations and residential care facilities accepting admissions of residents. In order to ensure sufficient acute hospital capacity to manage the anticipated surge in hospitals, emergency funding was made available to ensure patients who were clinically stable and appropriate for transfer could have their discharge facilitated, while adhering to the guidance. There was also an emphasis on ensuring that those patients who had completed their acute medical treatment should be prioritised for such transfers, either to residential care or with some home support, so as to avoid their exposure to the anticipated surge and prevent hospital-acquired Covid-19. The protocols set out in the guidance, along with infection prevention and control advice and supports, were put in place to assist the nursing home sector, with a view to mitigating the level of risk and transfer of Covid-19. It must be recognised that the pandemic has not concluded, and at this time a priority focus of Government remains on the ongoing management of Covid-19 and our response to it, to ensure that the positive gains now being experienced are preserved and that those most vulnerable to the virus continue to be safeguarded in the light of residual risk. The Department is continuing to look at options that may be available to the State in listening to the voices of those who have lost a loved one.I conclude by expressing my sincere condolences to those who have lost a loved one during this difficult time.	spk_325
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-07-15	dail	33	Departmental Funding	dbsect_36	The pandemic has been a particularly difficult time for all residents, relatives and staff of our nursing homes. As the House will be aware, the Covid-19 nursing home expert panel established last year provided a comprehensive report and package of recommendations in respect of the ongoing response to Covid-19 and longer-term strategic reform of the care of older persons. Many of the short and medium-term recommendations of the Covid-19 nursing home expert panel report have been implemented. Several of these relate to the delivery of a broad suite of supports provided to private nursing homes, including free personal protective equipment, serial testing, HSE Covid-19 response teams, infection prevention and control training and temporary accommodation for staff. Continued learning and understanding of the progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations. There has been significant and ongoing consideration of the impact of the pandemic. There have been various examinations and reports with a focus on Covid-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older people. There has been a clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic as the national and international understanding of the virus evolves. Where necessary we will ensure that the public health led approach evolves as evidence and learning materialises. The findings of these reports confirm that the infectious nature of Covid-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings. I look forward to supporting the significant work that is in train to further improve services for older persons.	spk_327

The Department provides An Taisce with funding for a variety of initiatives, including the National Spring Clean, Irish Business Against Litter, national anti-litter league and green schools programme. All payments made to An Taisce are in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circular 13/2014 regarding the management of grant funding provided from public money.Grant funding is paid on the basis of vouched expenditure only. An Taisce is required to provide supporting invoices stating that its claims relate to activities and services appropriate to the grant scheme objectives. The An Taisce green schools initiative, which Deputy Mattie McGrath outlined, is a whole-school programme and awards scheme comprising seven steps. It takes a thematic approach to environmental education. Key themes include litter and waste, energy, water, travel and biodiversity. Approximately 4,000 primary, secondary and special schools in Ireland are participating in the programme. This programme has been operating in Ireland since 1997 and is operated by the environmental education unit of An Taisce in partnership with local authorities and is supported by a number of Government Departments and agencies as well as corporate funders. The programme covers a wide range of thematic areas and impact measurements indicate substantial positive changes in knowledge, behaviour and opinion leadership among the participants. There are also substantial direct and indirect cost savings for schools in respect of waste, energy, water, and transport fuel with an associated reduction in greenhouse gases. The national spring clean is Ireland's largest anti-litter initiative and has been operating since 1999. The programme encourages and supports individuals and groups across society to take part in their own clean-up events. In 2020, the national spring clean took place without incident during a pandemic. The number of events in 2020 was 5,413 and approximately 2,900 tonnes of litter was collected. In 2021, the national spring clean progressed under level 5 restrictions. Family or household bubble groups held their own clean-up within a 5 km radius of their homes. As the level of restrictions is lifted, the spring clean will be able to expand its scope and carry on through the summer and into autumn The estimated allocation to An Taisce for 2021 is in line with the 2020 allocation of €675,000.

As he is aware, the programme for Government sets out several commitments in respect of the important policy area of building defects and provides for an examination of defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations in the Joint Committee on Housing's Safe as Houses? report. In that context, a working group to examine defects in housing was established. The Minister appointed Mr. Seamus Neely, former chief executive of Donegal County Council, as chair to the independent working group. The chair will oversee the effective implementation of the group's terms of reference, which have recently been adopted. The membership of the working group includes representatives with relevant expertise and experience from Engineers Ireland, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland, the public sector, the local authority sector, the legal sector, the Department of Finance, the Construction Defects Alliance, and the Apartment Owners Network. The group's terms of reference, as set out in a response to a parliamentary question, include:1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 ""Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation"" in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - 'Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection'.2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 - 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners' management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:- Identification and description of defect, - Nature of defect — design, product, workmanship, - Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage, - Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling, - Period of construction affected, - Type of dwelling affected, - Location of dwellings affected.3. Establish the scale of the issue - estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.- In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.5. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners' management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings, - Efficient means of carrying out work, - individual dwellings or whole building approach, - routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation, - Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution - advice and support.6. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.7. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.8.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-07-15	dail	33	Employment Schemes	dbsect_38	The new work placement experience programme is a key measure in our economic recovery plan and in the Government’s new employment services strategy, Pathways to Work. Launched on Monday, the programme provides tangible evidence of the Government's strong commitment to providing quality work experience and training opportunities for jobseekers, in particular, those whose jobs were permanently lost due to the pandemic.  The Government is putting in place a wide range of measures to support people whose jobs will not return after Covid-19 to help them find new jobs in new sectors of the economy. This work placement experience programme is such one such measure.  Apprenticeships and work placement programmes are proven and recognised internationally to be very effective in providing an opportunity for unemployed people to get on-the-job experience, improve their employment prospects and to get new jobs. Such approaches are supported by the EU under its recommendation on post-Covid labour market recovery and its effective active support to employment, EASE, and by our labour market advisory council. These programmes give relevant on-the-job experience and the confidence to find future employment.  The work placement experience programme is an entirely new scheme and is much different from schemes which went before it. The focus of this programme is on quality placements, accredited training and development and a higher payment rate than previous schemes, at €10.20 per hour for 30 hours work per week. Importantly, participation in the scheme will be completely voluntary. The payment rate of €306 per week is equivalent to open labour market rates and will provide six months' work experience with in-built training opportunities to 10,000 people. Training opportunities will comprise 60 hours per placement and 20 of those hours will be accredited. Persons who have been unemployed for six months, including time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment, will be eligible to participate in this programme.  The personal weekly rate will make the offering very attractive for young people, for whom some 4,000 places have been ring-fenced. Many young people whose employment has been especially adversely affected by Covid-19 will see this new programme as an excellent opportunity to improve their skills, get on-the-job experience and give them the confidence to find new employment opportunities. Stringent safeguards are being introduced with this programme to guard against any abuses. Each participant will have a case officer assigned to him or her. There will monthly compliance checks and two review visits during the course of each placement. All roles will be quality-checked in advance to ensure there is a training and development aspect to the role. The work placement experience programme is a very positive initiative and I encourage jobseekers and businesses to engage with it.	spk_297
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-07-15	dail	33	Employment Schemes	dbsect_38	This strategy aims to get people back to work as the economy and the labour market recover from Covid-19. Pathways to Work 2021-2025 is a strategy that sets out 83 whole-of-government commitments aimed at reducing unemployment to or below pre-pandemic 2019 levels. A key commitment under the strategy is the new work placement experience programme. This active labour market programme provides quality training and work experience opportunities for jobseekers out of work for six months or more to learn new skills in the workplace and to help them find new jobs. I have already outlined - I will do so again - that this work placement experience programme is different from earlier versions. It is positive that we can always strive to improve schemes and programmes. These will be quality placements involving accredited training and development and a higher payment rate than previous schemes of €10.20 per hour for 30 hours per week. Importantly, participation in the scheme will be completely voluntary and that point is very important. Nobody has to participate in this scheme. If you do not want to participate and decide not to do so, there will be no impact on your social welfare payments. I believe, however, that the programme will prove very attractive to many people. The payment rate of €306 per week is equivalent to open labour market rates. It equates to €10.20 per hour. The programme will provide six months' work experience with in-built training opportunities for 10,000 people. The training opportunities comprise 60 hours per placement, of which 20 hours will be accredited. Of course, there need to be appropriate safeguards such as stringent measures in place to include advance checks on placements, confirmation of training plans, monthly compliance checks and case officer engagement with the host and with the jobseeker over the six-month period. It is really important to say that apprenticeship programmes are proven internationally to be effective at helping people to get their foot in the door, to get on-the-job experience, to develop skill sets and, ultimately, to improve their chances of securing employment.	spk_299

Delivery of the driving test and the driver theory test, DTT, service are the statutory responsibility of the RSA and I have no power to intervene in individual cases. The gradual reopening of in-person driver theory test centres commenced on 8 June. The SRA reopened test centres and introduced capacity to increase the number of tests from an average of 15,000 tests in normal pre-Covid times to 25,000 tests monthly to tackle the backlog and shorten waiting times. The test centres have extensive Covid-19 measures in place to protect both customers and staff and to ensure the safe delivery of the service. The Department is working to increase capacity to 50,000 tests per month over time, if public health guidance permits. The service provider has sourced an additional 40 temporary team members to support the expected increase in capacity to 50,000 in-person test appointments. A pilot online driver theory test has been running for truck and bus categories and has been extended to include car and motorbike tests. The new offering saw 4,000 theory tests available for all categories of vehicles during June. The RSA has increased this by a further 6,000, bringing the total to 10,000 online tests that will be conducted during July. Tests are on a first-come, first-served basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year. The current number of confirmed bookings on the system is 116,024 scheduled tests. During the five weeks up to 5 July, 37,303 theory tests were scheduled to take place, 28,945 tests were taken and, of those, 22,603 were passed. The number of people who failed to pass was 6,342. It is clear that the service is back up and running. However, I am concerned at the number of applicants who do not show up for their test. The no-show figure is notable at 5,351. It is hugely disappointing that nearly 15% of candidates for the theory test are no-shows on the day, especially when there has been such high demand for the service.This puts an unnecessary strain on the service and further complicates matters for the many people awaiting a test and who will ultimately be delayed as a result. I know the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is concerned about this too and I understand it is looking at communications and reminders in order to reduce this number. Due to the suspension of driving testing services in the initial pandemic response, along with the health protocols required since the resumption of services, a significant backlog has developed. Driving tests for essential workers continue to be a priority for the driving testing service. However, in line with the gradual reopening of services, driving tests for all those who are eligible to take the test and have been waiting longest have recommenced in a limited fashion since the end of May. The further reopening of driving testing services will be the subject of discussions between the Department of Transport and the RSA in the coming weeks. The RSA driver testers are undertaking driving tests in extremely difficult conditions in an enclosed space where physical distancing is very difficult. They are using vehicles provided by the test candidates, which are not controllable environments. An additional 40 temporary testers were recruited in the second quarter of the year and 18 of the new recruits have completed training and been live testing since the week commencing 7 June. There are 21 more who have successfully completed training and began live testing yesterday, 12 July. Sanction was recently received for a further 40 temporary testers.	spk_346
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-07-13	dail	33	Olympic Games	dbsect_39	I thank the Deputies for raising the matter. I completely understand the frustration and concerns, particularly with young people who want to get on the road, get driving and through the theory test. In my opening remarks I highlighted that the online service is up to 10,000 tests per month but the real way to expedite the processing of the backlog is through in-person theory tests in testing centres. That capacity pre-Covid was 15,000 tests and it is now 25,000 tests per month. Deputy Calleary asked about the timeline for increasing this to 50,000 tests per month and it will be based on public health directions. I know the Department of Transport is working with the RSA on that. There are 116,000 scheduled theory tests so once 50,000 tests per month are allowed, it will get through the theory test backlog pretty swiftly. Deputy McHugh highlighted a case and I know it is very frustrating for many young people who are trying to access services. Special cases are operational matters for the RSA but I know the driver theory test provider makes special arrangements on the day for people with special needs. Concerns were also raised around the closure of some centres and I can follow up in order to get details for the Deputy. There is progress in the online theory test process. The fastest way to get through the backlog is by using the in-person theory tests in centres, and the RSA has said the operator will supply extra staff in order to try to get through the backlog as quickly as possible. The Deputies can rest assured that I completely understand their frustrations and the Department is working in conjunction with the RSA on whatever we can do to expedite the matter.	spk_350

The current number of confirmed bookings on the system is 116,024 scheduled tests. During the five weeks up to 5 July, 37,303 theory tests were scheduled to take place, 28,945 tests were taken and, of those, 22,603 were passed. The number of people who failed to pass was 6,342. It is clear that the service is back up and running. However, I am concerned at the number of applicants who do not show up for their test. The no-show figure is notable at 5,351. It is hugely disappointing that nearly 15% of candidates for the theory test are no-shows on the day, especially when there has been such high demand for the service.This puts an unnecessary strain on the service and further complicates matters for the many people awaiting a test and who will ultimately be delayed as a result. I know the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is concerned about this too and I understand it is looking at communications and reminders in order to reduce this number. Due to the suspension of driving testing services in the initial pandemic response, along with the health protocols required since the resumption of services, a significant backlog has developed. Driving tests for essential workers continue to be a priority for the driving testing service. However, in line with the gradual reopening of services, driving tests for all those who are eligible to take the test and have been waiting longest have recommenced in a limited fashion since the end of May. The further reopening of driving testing services will be the subject of discussions between the Department of Transport and the RSA in the coming weeks. The RSA driver testers are undertaking driving tests in extremely difficult conditions in an enclosed space where physical distancing is very difficult. They are using vehicles provided by the test candidates, which are not controllable environments. An additional 40 temporary testers were recruited in the second quarter of the year and 18 of the new recruits have completed training and been live testing since the week commencing 7 June. There are 21 more who have successfully completed training and began live testing yesterday, 12 July. Sanction was recently received for a further 40 temporary testers.	spk_346
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-07-13	dail	33	Driver Test	dbsect_42	I thank the Deputies for raising the matter. I completely understand the frustration and concerns, particularly with young people who want to get on the road, get driving and through the theory test. In my opening remarks I highlighted that the online service is up to 10,000 tests per month but the real way to expedite the processing of the backlog is through in-person theory tests in testing centres. That capacity pre-Covid was 15,000 tests and it is now 25,000 tests per month. Deputy Calleary asked about the timeline for increasing this to 50,000 tests per month and it will be based on public health directions. I know the Department of Transport is working with the RSA on that. There are 116,000 scheduled theory tests so once 50,000 tests per month are allowed, it will get through the theory test backlog pretty swiftly. Deputy McHugh highlighted a case and I know it is very frustrating for many young people who are trying to access services. Special cases are operational matters for the RSA but I know the driver theory test provider makes special arrangements on the day for people with special needs. Concerns were also raised around the closure of some centres and I can follow up in order to get details for the Deputy. There is progress in the online theory test process. The fastest way to get through the backlog is by using the in-person theory tests in centres, and the RSA has said the operator will supply extra staff in order to try to get through the backlog as quickly as possible. The Deputies can rest assured that I completely understand their frustrations and the Department is working in conjunction with the RSA on whatever we can do to expedite the matter.	spk_350

The Minister and I do not have any role in the conduct of its investigation. I understand that, for its convenience, the commission is supported by the IT unit in my Department. I am informed that in May 2019, having been made aware of the loss of a USB stick containing personal data relating to the commission, my Department notified the Data Protection Commission, as required under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the Data Protection Act 2018. I am further informed that, in keeping with the usual policy, my Department's data protection officer investigated the circumstances surrounding the missing USB stick, and the outcome of that investigation was subsequently notified to the Data Protection Commission. I understand the investigation found that despite a thorough search of both premises, the missing USB stick was not located. An Post indicated that no USB stick was identified in its recovery or reclaim unit. The USB stick in question was an Integral Courier USB key with hardware encryption. The encryption used with this device is advanced encryption standard, AES, 256-bit, which is ISO 27001 compliant, a leading international standard for information security. The data contained on the USB stick had been uploaded to the commission’s secure system prior to the stick being mislaid so the information itself was not lost. As the data contained on the USB stick continued to be available to the commission and the missing USB stick was fully encrypted to industry standard, the risk to individuals whose personal data was on the USB stick was evaluated, as required by data protection legislation, and found to be low.	spk_109

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-07-08	dail	33	Missing Persons	dbsect_24	The roll-out of community CCTV schemes across the country has benefitted many communities, helping people to feel safer in their local areas. It is a priority of mine to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to their local CCTV schemes while ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of statutory data protection considerations. Since 2017, the Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of €40,000. The scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for the extension or upgrade of existing community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to €5,000 for minor maintenance costs. The scheme is open for applications from all counties. A total of 34 schemes have been funded to date with commitments of almost €940,000 made to these schemes across ten counties and I can confirm that funding continues to be available for 2021. If the Deputy is aware of groups in County Carlow wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from the Department's website, and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address. The Deputy will be aware that community-based CCTV is governed by the Garda Síochána Act 2005, section 38(3)(c), and the Garda Síochána (CCTV) Order 2006, SI 289 of 2006. This legal framework sets out a number of safeguards, requiring that any proposed community CCTV scheme must: be approved by the local joint policing committee; have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller; and have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.	spk_135

The Deputy's question was in relation to additional Garda CCTV cameras being provided in Carlow. I understand there are currently 14 CCTV cameras in Carlow town centre and three cameras situated in the town park as part of the Garda CCTV system. It is important to note this is a Garda CCTV system and is not part of the community CCTV scheme, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, for which the Department provides grant aid. Any amendments to the Garda CCTV system are operational matters for the Garda Commissioner and are not connected to the community CCTV scheme.	spk_137

As I said, these are matters for the Garda Commissioner as they are operational matters. To update the Deputy, as of 31 May 2021 there were 337 gardaí assigned to the Kilkenny-Carlow division. This represents an increase of almost 19% since December 2015, when there were 284 Garda staff members assigned to the division. A detailed breakdown of the Garda workforce is available on the Department's website. As the Deputy will know, An Garda Síochána has been allocated an unprecedented budget of €1.952 billion for 2021. This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing Garda recruitment. As a result, the number of Garda members is now approximately 14,500 and there are over 3,000 Garda staff nationwide. Taken together, this increase in the number of Garda members and staff is delivering significant growth in operational policing hours nationwide.	spk_139

As the Deputy will understand, the proportion of applications for involuntary detention reflects the unfortunate reality that gardaí often encounter persons with severe mental health issues and will be called upon by members of the public, or indeed family members, where a person is experiencing high levels of distress. Very often, members of An Garda Síochána are the first available front-line service to whom people will turn in such situations. An application for involuntary detention is never made lightly and takes full account of An Garda Síochána‘s obligation to protect the human rights and welfare of individuals and communities. The only statutory option available to gardaí responding to persons in a mental health crisis and who potentially pose a risk of harm to themselves or others is to invoke section 12 of the Mental Health Act 2001. Section 12 requires gardaí to take the person into custody in order to have them assessed by a registered medical practitioner. Members of An Garda Síochána receive training in mental health issues as part of their recruit training and through continuous professional development training delivered throughout their career. As the Deputy may be aware, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland concluded that societal issues such as the mental health of individuals should not be the responsibility of An Garda Síochána alone, and the commission recommended the establishment of multi-agency teams that would include gardaí to respond to the needs of individuals with mental health issues. A pilot crisis intervention team is being developed in the Limerick Garda division, as the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, mentioned earlier. This pilot is being progressed in close collaboration with the HSE and it is hoped to begin the roll-out of the pilot team early next year.	spk_156

I thank the Deputies for introducing this Bill and their contributions this evening. Organised crime has destroyed lives and undermined communities all over Ireland. It affects every community but those that are already disadvantaged have borne the brunt of the harm. It is absolutely right, therefore, that we recognise and seek to alleviate that harm through increased investment into those communities. I welcome and look forward to the debate this evening. The Garda and the Criminal Assets Bureau have had very significant success in recent years hitting the criminal gangs that have spread such misery. As the Deputies have mentioned, in 2019, a record €65 million was frozen on foot of CAB's work, up from €8.3 million in 2018. This dramatic increase reflects a one-off seizure in 2019 and there is a very significant difference between assets being initially frozen and those assets being disposed of and their value realised but the amounts involved are nonetheless very substantial. In a reflection of the importance of CAB's work, an increase in funding of almost 10% was approved in its budget for 2021. To ensure successes are reflected in increased community investment, in April my colleagues, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, announced agreement in principle to establish the community safety innovation fund to support vital projects and ensure this money is used for the benefit of disadvantaged communities. This fund will be included in the justice Vote as part of the Estimates process for 2022 and the allocation to it will reflect the amounts returned to the Exchequer from the proceeds of crime. The establishment of the fund will provide additional money for investment in important community projects but it will not replace existing sources of funding. It is being designed to encourage and recognise the efforts of local communities on the ground based on their local experience and unique perspectives and to support communities in building resilience and enhancing existing community services. The establishment of the fund will ensure that the best proposals to improve community safety will get the funding they need and encourage the development of innovative ways in which to improve community safety from those people who understand local community safety needs best. It will also allow best practice on community safety to be shared with other partnerships around the country as new proposals get developed. In practical terms, while the Proceeds of Crime Acts provide for the return of assets seized by CAB to the Exchequer, this does not happen at the time of seizure. A court determination is required and a seven-year period must elapse before ultimate confiscation. It is only at this point that the money is returned and available to the Exchequer. The seven-year period may be waived only if all relevant parties consent, and potential delays can and do arise through legal challenges. Given the uncertainty involved in the amounts and the time that elapses between seizure and realisation of value, it is not practical or appropriate to directly link project budgets to such seizures. Such a direct link would not provide any certainty for projects or allow them to take any sort of a long-term view on their work, whereas the approach being taken by the Government will provide certainty and funding to local communities. Accordingly, as agreed with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, the allocation to the fund will be made taking a longer term view reflecting the revenue that is returned from proceeds of crime actions. This funding is expected to operate in a similar manner to that successfully used at present around dormant accounts funding, which operates on the basis of rolling plans and allocations for specific purposes, making it clear how the extra resources are being targeted and ensuring accountability. Enhancing community safety is a priority for the Government and this is reflected in Justice Plan 2021, which was published by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, earlier this year. The Government's goal is to provide more targeted and effective support to the most disadvantaged communities and foster safe local areas for families, residents and businesses in order to feel more secure. The objective is to link with other whole-of-government strategies and structures, such as the healthy communities initiative being developed under Slåintecare and the existing local community development committees, to allow these areas to develop and flourish and for areas to break the cycle of disadvantage. While State services carry out their individual responsibilities, too often their interventions rely on a reactive response to emergency and crisis situations. The aim of community safety is to focus all relevant government services on prevention and early interventions and the impact that a shared approach to problem-solving can have in ensuring that situations do not develop to the point where they impact on the safety or feeling of safety of the community at large. This will mean State services working with each other and the community to ensure there is better co-ordination between services such as educational and youth work with young people, the availability of local health and mental health services, drug prevention, housing and the built environment and actions taken to combat alcohol and substance abuse, domestic abuse, youth crime, antisocial behaviour and hate crime. This policy will be supported by the policing, security and community safety Bill, legislation that will place a statutory obligation on Departments, local authorities, public bodies and agencies to have regard to harm prevention in their activities and to co-operate with each other to deliver safer communities. Justice Plan 2021 contains a number of specific commitments to enhance community safety. These include publishing the scoping exercise on criminal activity in Drogheda, agreeing a cross-Department implementation plan and supporting and working with Dublin City Council to ensure the implementation of the report on Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview in north Dublin city. It also commits to establishing three pilot community safety partnerships in Dublin city, Longford and Waterford. On the question of Drogheda, I welcome today's announcement by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, of new national and local structures that will drive and co-ordinate a plan to increase safety and well-being in Drogheda. The Minister also today welcomed a commitment by Mr. Martin O'Brien, the chief executive of the Louth and Meath Education and Training Board, that the training board will host new structures to deliver services in Drogheda. The Drogheda implementation board will be the core driver and co-ordinator of change in Drogheda through the actions to be outlined in the Drogheda implementation plan, which will be brought to the Cabinet and published by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, before the summer break. The Minister also announced Mr. Michael Keogh, a former senior official in the Department of Education who is from Drogheda, as the chair of the Drogheda implementation board. The Government will agree the Drogheda implementation plan and the Minister will publish it before the summer break. Local community safety partnerships will be piloted in Dublin's north inner city, Waterford city and county and Longford county. The locations of the pilots were chosen based on a number of factors, including population density, crime rates and deprivation. These locations allow the proposed structure to be trialled in a high population density area, a medium population density area and a low population density area with a regional distribution. The pilots will run for 24 months and be subject to a robust independent evaluation from the outset in order to ensure the proposed structures are fulfilling their objectives. The lessons from the pilots and their evaluation will be taken into account in the drafting of the statutory framework for community safety and will be applied to the national roll-out of similar partnerships in communities across the country. At the beginning of the year, a chair was appointed to the local community safety partnership in the north inner city electoral area and last month I announced the chairs for Waterford and Longford local community safety pilots. These chairs bring extensive expertise and experience to their roles and I look forward to working closely with them and with the local communities over the coming months as the partnerships are established. The local community safety partnerships will replace the joint policing committees, building on the work they have done to date. Each partnership will devise and oversee a local community safety plan that will be informed by the community itself. The plans will detail how best the community wants to prevent crime and will reflect community priorities and local safety issues. The goal is to make communities safer for families, residents and businesses. These partnerships will operate at local authority administrative level and replace and build upon joint policing committees.They will bring together residents, community representatives, business interests, councillors, local authorities and State services such as An Garda Síochána, Tusla and the HSE to devise and implement local community safety plans. Partnerships will support a strategic approach to this work so that issues arising can be dealt with in a co-ordinated manner, and addressed collectively by relevant service providers in partnership with the community. It is not intended that the local community safety partnerships will replace or impede the functioning of successful local safety initiatives. The intention is that where local safety fora are active, the local safety partnerships will serve as a useful forum to which they can escalate any issues as appropriate, and gain access to a range of service providers. The pilots will inform the development of the roll-out of local community safety partnerships in every local authority area as part of the provisions of the policing, security and community safety Bill. I will speak briefly in respect of the specific provisions of the Bill. I note that the Deputies' Bill suggests that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would conduct reviews of supports for disadvantaged communities and prioritise the resulting recommendations. I suggest to the Deputies that this process of ongoing review and prioritisation would be more appropriately conducted through the community safety innovation fund as I have set out above. As I have also mentioned, there are practical issues with the sort of ring-fencing that the Bill envisages. However, the Government and I support the principle behind the Bill that revenue from proceeds of crime seizures should support investment into disadvantaged communities. I believe that we are agreed across the House that this is the case. The question of how best to achieve this is one I am happy to discuss both now and in the future with Deputies and we will not be opposing this Bill on Second Stage.	spk_459
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-07-08	dail	33	Proceeds of Crime (Investment in Disadvantaged Communities) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_65	I thank the Deputies for their contributions. I welcome the debate and the opportunity to discuss these issues. Targeting the money is central to fighting organised crime. Those who mastermind crimes such as drug trafficking, human trafficking and fraud depend on hiding and converting the proceeds of those crimes. By pursuing the proceeds, we can bring those responsible to justice and meaningfully reduce the incentive to commit the crimes in the first place. We can also use the proceeds to help with the damage that organised crime does to our local communities. The establishment of the community safety innovation fund will ensure that there is proper reinvestment into communities, reflecting the successes we have had in pursuing the proceeds of crime. I acknowledge the support of colleagues across the Government, in particular the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in facilitating the establishment of the fund. Enhancing community safety is a priority for the Government. It is reflected across the Justice Plan 2021, which was published by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, earlier this year.Our goal is to provide effective support and allow areas to develop and to break the cycles of disadvantage. I emphasise, as I did in my opening speech, that the establishment of the community safety fund is intended to complement existing structures. It will not replace existing sources of funding. Rather, it will be an additional and alternative route to funding for important community projects. I also wish to acknowledge the work of CAB. The bureau is widely regarded as a best-practice model in the context of combating organised crime. It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The investigations conducted by the Criminal Assets Bureau and the consequential proceedings and actions resulted in more than €194.5 million returned to the Exchequer since its establishment in 1996. I thank all the Deputies for their contributions and look forward to considering these questions further.	spk_475
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-07-07	dail	33	Post Office Network: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_7	"I thank the Deputies for their contributions and for the opportunity to address this motion today. I know Deputies raised the important matter of the post office network in October last year and the motion before us today recognises the views of the Members who participated in that debate. I noted at the time I was in agreement with many of the sentiments expressed by Deputies and the Government does not intend to oppose today's motion from the Regional Group. The Government's programme is clear, and a modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprise as part of our commitment to a sustainable nationwide post office network. The Government's objectives for An Post include harnessing the opportunities presented by e-commerce and the digital economy, capturing and retaining market share in parcels and delivering a sustainable nationwide post office network offering a range of e-commerce, financial and Government services. Deputies are aware of the scale of the transformation that An Post is undergoing, which is a vital part of the delivery of its strategic plan. In order to implement the plan, the cost of which was estimated to be in the region of €150 million, the Government provided a long-term low-interest loan of €30 million to the company in December 2017 to support and protect the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a five day per week mail delivery service. An investment loan of €40 million from the European Investment Bank has also been made available to finance innovation and modernisation projects. This borrowing is being used to help to fund the capital costs associated with five investment programmes that form part of the transformation plan, including post office renewal. A capital expenditure programme has also been approved, which, as part of the company's commitment to the sustainability of its network, is designed to develop the newer elements of An Post's financial services business and mitigate declining core mail volumes and revenues on the retail side of the business. The deal agreed between An Post and postmasters in 2018 centred around a renewed vision of the post office network and a revised postmaster contract. There is an acceptance that new business lines were required, with a focus on financial and new government services, along with a capital investment plan for the renewal of existing offices. The agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters' Union underpinned significant change and investment to redefine the post office network, including reducing the number of post offices, modernising the postmaster contract and updating the brand. The consolidation of the post office network has assured the widest possible distribution across the State with an ever-improving network. The key focus continues to be to future-proof the company and keep it relevant to customers in the types of services it provides. This restructuring has seen the development of new areas of business, particularly in parcel delivery but also in new retail areas and financial services, resulting in a return to annual profitability since the implementation of the plan. Acknowledging that the transformation plan has been severely affected by Covid-19 and the transformation payments to postmasters provided under this agreement ceased at the end of June, my officials and I have been engaging extensively with An Post on the matter. I am pleased to advise Deputies that An Post reached an agreement with the Irish Postmasters' Union in late June for an €8.5 million fund that will benefit all post offices over the next 18 months. Due to the improving financial position of the company, An Post will fund this programme from its own resources. The agreement is in line with An Post's strategic plan and it recognises the central role of the post office network to the company. It provides for a tailored payment for each post office based on the forecasted business loss and it will benefit the entire network. It will take account of products affected during Covid-19, such as foreign exchange transactions. An Post has invested in its network and as part of this proposal it will equip postmasters with commercial training and marketing support to promote their businesses, as well as maintaining continued investment in new products and services. I stress that the terms under which postmasters are contracted to An Post is a matter between postmasters and An Post and any negotiations are a matter for both parties directly. An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and formats, including, among others, the diversification and growth of financial services products that it provides for individuals and small and medium enterprises, including loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products. It will also provide local banking in association with major banks and a full range of State savings products. An Post is a strong commercial semi-State body and its strategy, as approved by the Minister, seeks to build on its growth and diversification. The post office network is one of the company's core strengths and the continued development of the network and its services is a vital component in its sustainability. As with many businesses, the post office must continue to develop commercial strategies to enable it to grow and maintain its relevance for users. We are working with An Post to investigate the scope to channel additional services through the network. All options will be considered fully and the ongoing transformation in the company aims to ensure the commercial viability of An Post and the continued fulfilment of its mandate to provide mail delivery services and ensure a viable post office network. It is important to note that An Post is a commercial State body with a mandate to act commercially. It has statutory responsibility for the State's postal service and the post office network. Decisions relating to the network, including those relating to the size, distribution and future of the network, are operational matters for the board and management of the company. It is long-standing Government policy that postal services would not be directly subsidised by the Government but we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. At a recent meeting of a joint Oireachtas committee, the chief executive of An Post noted that the company has been commercially successful and self-sufficient and there are no plans to bring forward a public service obligation at this time. If An Post, postmasters and the Government continue to work together, we can ensure the network can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable, community-focused services. We want to have a sustainable post office network available to all our citizens, both urban and rural, in the medium and long term. The Government continues to provide significant business to An Post through the Department of Social Protection social welfare contract and National Treasury Management Agency business, which sees over 44 million transactions through the post office network. This includes €20.6 billion of State savings administered for the National Treasury Management Agency, 520,000 Department of Social Protection clients paid every week, with an annual value of €7.2 billion, €160 million in television licence income and 198,000 passport applicants. The Government decided in March to set up an offline services group to explore the potential of a one-stop approach, including the identification of suitable services based on the recommendations of the offline services report, and to examine the feasibility of directing more Government business to the post office network. The group is co-chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Departments of the Taoiseach; Transport; Foreign Affairs; Rural and Community Development; Social Protection; Housing, Planning and Local Government; and the Revenue Commissioners are represented, along with the Road Safety Authority and the Local Government Management Agency. In conducting its work, this group is considering the increased use of the post office network for the delivery of government services. Like many other aspects of our lives, the way in which the public accesses government services is likely to have been profoundly affected by the pandemic and we must consider these changes and our response to them very carefully. The group is increasingly looking at the strengths of An Post in terms of brand, digital presence and reach and its characteristic of being a unique human network. It is clear An Post has the capability to compete for more than just offline services and can offer an ""omni-channel"" agency role to the Government and other customers. We must consider our approach to government service provision in light of our experience, not in terms of individual offline services, such as offline applications for motor tax, but as a modern, customer-focused collective whole. The Government is committed to working with An Post and postmasters to ensure the network can continue to play a strong role in delivering State services. While respecting An Post's commercial mandate, every effort will be made to give effect to the Government's commitment to ensure a sustainable and viable post office network."	spk_17
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-07-06	dail	33	Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence: Statements	dbsect_13	I welcome the statement from the Taoiseach and the shared level of concern demonstrated by Deputies. I also welcome the opportunity to hear their views on how we ensure the best outcomes for victims of domestic abuse and violence. No person or family should have to endure these experiences. My Department is fully committed to combating this type of violence. Along with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, one of my key focus areas is the continued implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey. We are working to create a victim-centred system that supports and empowers victims and gives them the confidence to engage with all services knowing they will be supported, informed and treated with respect and dignity at every point and by every person they come into contact with. The supports being introduced will be provided regardless of whether criminal proceedings are in train and will extend beyond the trial and verdict because victims do not stop needing support at the end of a trial. The way our system has historically treated victims of sexual violence has, quite simply, not been good enough. Victims did not feel supported and the system did not protect them from further trauma. When it was published, it was made clear that Supporting A Victim's Journey was to be a living document and we are continuing to listen to victims as they courageously share their experience of the criminal justice system with us. We are considering how best to address additional concerns that have been raised and will continue to prioritise this aspect of our work.  The issue of emergency calls from victims of domestic violence not being responded to has also been raised by a number of Deputies. It is, of course, of particular concern to us all that anyone experiencing domestic abuse and, indeed, anyone in a vulnerable position, who summoned the courage to seek assistance may not have received it. It is vital that the best interests of victims and anyone whose calls were cancelled inappropriately are the priority and focus as this is being investigated.  In February, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, requested the Policing Authority to oversee the ongoing work by An Garda Síochána to review how 999 calls were handled. It is welcome that there has been ongoing engagement on this issue between the authority and the Garda Commissioner at both their public and private meetings. The report from the authority on this matter will be provided to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and she will consider any recommendations made in that report. Importantly, the Garda Commissioner has assured the Minister that when someone calls 999 now, he or she can expect and trust that An Garda Síochána will help and, of course, that should always be the case. When I launched the Women's Aid impact report for 2020 last month, I was immediately taken aback by the headline figures of more than 30,000 disclosures of abuse against women and children, almost 25,000 disclosures of domestic violence, including coercive control, and 340 disclosures of rape to the Women's Aid helpline.Each of these calls represents a woman or, perhaps, a family in dreadful circumstances, desperate for help. It was upsetting and it is an area that is justifiably a priority for this Government. I was heartened also at the report launch. It is important to recognise the incredible work undertaken by everyone across the sector who plays such an important, but usually unheralded, role as we strive to achieve our strategic objectives on domestic abuse intervention. This collective contribution not only brings a focus to the often hidden consequences of domestic violence but also provides the support services so vital to those who reach out. I share that collective aim. I am committed to making sure we have the necessary systems in place to ensure victims' needs are met in every practical, legal and emotional way. Supporting victims is crucial and this means, in part, having in place robust legislation to bring perpetrators to justice. The landmark Domestic Violence Act 2018 recognises in law the devastating impact of coercive control on those on whom it is inflicted. I echo the Taoiseach in welcoming recent convictions for coercive control. It conveys the message that perpetrators cannot act with impunity, and it changes how as a society we view and tackle such heinous behaviour. The bravery of the victims in these cases is to be commended. It is hoped that as more convictions follow, other victims of coercive control will feel confident to come forward. The Taoiseach spoke earlier about my Department's continuing commitment and response to combating domestic abuse and the wider issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The Taoiseach and a number of Deputies referred to the audit on Government responsibility, the review being undertaken by Tusla of emergency accommodation, and the development of the third national strategy. I can inform Deputies the audit report has been finalised and I expect to bring it to Government before the summer recess. I understand the review of emergency accommodation is also nearing completion. It is vital we have in place the right structures and supports for victims. This is a personal priority for the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman and me. The information from the audit and review will feed into the development of the third national strategy to address domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. This whole-of-government strategy will place a priority on prevention and reduction, it will include a national preventative strategy, and it is on track to be adopted before the end of the year. Domestic abuse can devastate an entire family unit. It is important to mention a number of important actions under way in my Department to ensure we have a justice system that works for families. A family justice oversight group has been established to agree a high-level vision and key medium and longer term objectives for the development of a national family justice system. In parallel, a dedicated family court structure is being established under the forthcoming family court Bill. As part of its work, a public consultation on the future of the family justice system has been recently completed and a dedicated consultation with children and young people will commence later this year. As I mentioned, a family court Bill is being drafted and its enactment will be a key element in the development of a more efficient and user-friendly family court system. This will be a system that puts families at the centre of its activities, provides access to specialist supports, and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings. I thank Deputies for their invaluable contributions on this important and often difficult issue. We are working hard on it and will continue to do so, liaising closely with all relevant groups and stakeholders across the sector to meet the needs of victims and to continue to combat domestic abuse.	spk_210
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-30	dail	33	Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Second Stage	dbsect_20	"I thank the Deputies for their contributions over the course of the debate of this Bill and for the constructive engagement by the House to progress this matter as quickly as possible.The measures in this Bill provide that a licensee may sell alcohol to persons in an outdoor seating area not within their licensed premises and provide for an increase in the number of judges in the High Court, which has become acutely urgent in the circumstances of Covid-19. This is important legislation at a sensitive time, intended to clarify the position of licenceholders who wish to sell and serve alcohol adjacent to a licensed premises in an area approved by the relevant local authority. These premises have no remedy to amend their licence to include that area under current legislation. To ensure maximum equity with businesses that seek to comply with the Government's guidance and regulations for outdoor activity in the Covid context, it was considered prudent to provide some clarity and assurances for licensees who rely on private property immediately adjacent to their licensed premises to provide outdoor seating areas. The Minster, Deputy Humphreys, outlined the main provisions of the Bill previously in this House. It is clear this effective measure to address this matter for licensees for the period ahead is appropriate. Together with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, I am committed to delivering the Government's commitment to modernise alcohol legislation. The complexity of the law in this area and the challenges of this matter demonstrate the real impetus for this reform. We look forward to producing legislation and working with the House to codify the licensing laws and to bring a more permanent solution to the situation that has arisen here. It is important to note that the creation of an offence and the application of the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 pertain to these outdoor seating areas. The overwhelming majority of licensees complied with the provisions of the enforcement powers Act and it is anticipated that the provisions in this Bill will be similarly adhered to with very few exceptions. The Bill also provides for objections to renewals. It outlines that failure to operate an outdoor area in accordance with the Acts shall be grounds for objection to the renewal of the licence or a certificate of registration in regard to clubs. This shall apply irrespective of whether, at the time of renewal, the licensee has ceased to operate the outdoor seating area. It is also noted that there is sunset clause in place until 30 November. The House will have an opportunity to consider whether it is appropriate for this legislation to be renewed at that time. I will refer to some of the issues raised by Deputies in the House this evening. Regarding yesterday's decision, which I acknowledge was a very difficult one, the Government has always stated that when we reopen sections of the economy, we want them to stay open. We are working to ensure we can reopen indoor hospitality. That work is currently under way on foot of NPHET advice. A number of other issues were raised by Deputies in regard to the Bill. Deputy McNamara referred to private lands and the outdoor seating areas. In the Bill, ""private lands"" means land other than State land within the meaning of the State Property Act 1954.It is important to note that the permissive inclusion of outdoor seating areas on private lands for the purpose of this Bill is subject to a number of conditions. These conditions are set out in the definition of ""outdoor seating area"". The definition applies to land which is not already the subject of a licence. The number of seated patrons who can be accommodated in the area must not exceed the number of patrons who may be accommodated in the licensed premises and the areas should contain sufficient seating to accommodate this number of patrons. In addition, this cannot contain any bar area across which intoxicating liquor can be served to the public. The sale or supply of intoxicating liquor by the licensee in this outdoor seating area should not be the primary purpose of the business. With regard to outdoor recreational spaces, the Minister, in her other remit as Minister for Rural and Community Development, has provided a significant amount of funding to local authorities under the outdoor recreation scheme for the local authorities to invest in public realm facilities and infrastructure. It is also a commitment of the Government throughout the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure we can accommodate the public to enjoy an outdoor summer. This will have longer term benefits for towns and villages across the country. Another issue raised which I wish to address related to the courts and the appointment of judges. As regards the propriety of the amendment to section 9 of the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1995 being progressed in section 8 of this Bill, it was originally intended to accommodate this provision in the forthcoming courts and civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill, but due to its urgency this Bill was viewed as an appropriate legislative opportunity given its urgency, which is also linked to Covid-19 matters. Despite measures taken by the Courts Service to meet the demands placed on it during the pandemic, including facilitating increased use of remote hearings, the courts and the Judiciary continue to face unprecedented challenges in respect of available resources, particularly in the High Court. The existing backlog and waiting times for hearings have increased since the beginning of the pandemic and it is anticipated that there will be a significant demand for access to the courts once public health restrictions have lifted. Furthermore, the difficulties facing the court have been exacerbated by the appointment of a number of judges to various State bodies and tribunals of investigation. Section 8 is urgently required. It provides an opportunity to address the challenges facing the court. It is crucial to address the significant volume of work before the courts and the workload. Most importantly, it is in the interest of the administration of justice to do so. Why is it necessary to include this amendment in section 8 now? It is urgently needed because, as I said, it provides an opportunity to address the challenges facing the courts in the pandemic, including the increase in backlogs of cases, increasing waiting times and the anticipated demand on the courts and the Courts Service. Currently, the maximum permitted number of ordinary judges of the High Court is 37. In total, there are 40 serving judges on the court. However, one of these is the President of the High Court and two have been assigned to the Law Reform Commission and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, respectively. The last time the number was increased was in 2015. Of the 37 ordinary judges of the court, three are currently appointed to tribunals of investigation and to Judicial Council commitments and one has recently been nominated for appointment to the Court of Appeal. Arrangements are being made for this appointment by the President. In real terms, therefore, the number of judges available to sit in the High Court in the coming months will be reduced to 36, which is less than the maximum currently provided for in law. Finally, I thank Deputies for their engagement on this Bill. I look forward to progressing the legislation through the House."	spk_272

The proposed amendment removes paragraph (d) of the definition of a ""specified person"" to exclude, in the context of an outdoor seating area, any other person for the time being in charge of a premises. With regard to a relevant premises, a specified person means a licensee, occupier, manager or another person in charge of the premises at the time. This is important as these persons may all be given a direction by a member of An Garda Síochána where that member suspects with reasonable cause that a specified person is not complying with the Licensing Acts, the Registration of Clubs Acts, an authorisation or the provisions in this Bill insofar as they relate to an outdoor seating area. The definition of a ""specified person"" captures the persons in charge of a licensed premises.

An outdoor seating area is clearly defined as an area ""abutting the premises"". That is the area we are talking about here. Regarding the number of seated patrons, which was raised by Deputies Howlin and Mattie McGrath, the number of seated patrons who can be accommodated in the area must not exceed the number of patrons who may be accommodated in the licensed premises. In addition, the area which should contain sufficient seating to accommodate this number of seated patrons, cannot contain any counter or barrier across which intoxicating liquor can be served to the public, and the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor by the licensee in this outdoor seating area should not be the primary purpose of the business. This is a common-sense provision to ensure that the licensee is managing the number of patrons that he or she is used to having on the premises."	spk_281

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-17	dail	33	Regional Airports and Aviation: Statements	dbsect_32	I am delighted to have the opportunity to update the House this evening on what the Government is doing to support our regional airports and aviation in general. As an island nation, Ireland is particularly dependent on air connectivity, both socially and economically, and we all know that international travel and regional connectivity, which is facilitated by our regional airports, is vital for the economic well-being of the regions served. Government policy on regional airports seeks to optimise conditions for regional development and connectivity for both social and economic benefits. The Government recognises that, as employers, airports contribute to the local economy and employment is also supported through the various ancillary services that are provided to the airports. However, we are all too aware of the impact Covid-19, coupled with the emergence and spread of variants of concern, have had on international travel. Globally, aviation is experiencing the most challenging crisis in its history, with European flights reducing from more than 11 million in 2019 to 5 million in 2020. Restrictions on international travel to date have further suppressed passenger numbers. Passenger air travel revenues have fallen to a fraction of 2019 levels. Scheduled carrier flights were down by approximately 60% and at year's end more than 4,000 aircraft, which represents half of the European aircraft fleet, were grounded. A similar number of flights across Europe is forecast for 2021 in a base case scenario. However, Eurocontrol, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, has indicated that if more states relax their restrictions sooner and fully implement procedures, such as the EU's digital Covid certificate, as soon as possible, its forecast optimistic scenario could see the network handling 69% of 2019 traffic levels in August. In Ireland, the general reduction in passenger numbers has severely impacted the aviation industry. This has led to companies, both in Ireland and in a wider European context, taking action to rationalise their cost base, including redundancies and staff reduction measures, as well as taking steps to safeguard liquidity through borrowing and new shareholder capital. I deeply regret the most recent announcement of the loss of 480 jobs as a result of the entry into voluntary liquidation of Stobart Air over the weekend. This came further to the announcement by Aer Lingus of the closure of its base at Shannon recently. I acknowledge the devastating impact of these announcements on all the staff involved and to all those in the aviation industry who continue to be impacted by the most sustained and deepest period of suppression this sector has ever faced. Job cuts have unfortunately been a feature of other European airlines, including the loss of 24,000 jobs at Lufthansa, 10,000 jobs at lAG, 5,000 jobs at KLM, with further job losses signalled in industry-wide restructuring as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. These job losses have arisen even with the provision of substantial state supports and are indicative of the scale of the crisis in the sector. As Deputies will be aware, Stobart Air's plans to secure a new buyer failed over the weekend and this action resulted in Stobart Air commencing a process of voluntary liquidation. This resulted in Stobart Air's franchise agreement with Aer Lingus being terminated with immediate effect. I assure the House that the restoration of regional connectivity is a critical priority for the Government. The market has already moved to replace some of the lost routes, with Aer Lingus and BA CityFlyer now operating temporary replacement services which will cover most of the affected routes operating out of Dublin Airport and Belfast City Airport. Together with routing options, this will allow passengers impacted by the situation to return home. The termination of the franchise agreement with Aer Lingus also had immediate implications for both of our Government public service obligation, PSO, supported air services operated by Stobart Air on two routes between Dublin Airport and Donegal and Kerry airports. I am, however, happy to advise that work is under way in my Department to launch an emergency procurement process with a view to restoring air services on these vital regional routes as quickly as possible in the coming weeks. I fully understand the importance of having these services in place by 19 July, when international travel is to return. My Department plans to issue a request for quotes directly to airlines in the coming days in accordance with applicable EU rules on air service PSOs. It is anticipated that this accelerated procurement process will be completed by early July with a view to services recommencing under the new operator or operators as soon as possible thereafter. The new contract will be subject to a maximum term of seven months and will operate in accordance with EU law. To mitigate against any further disruption to these services, my Department will also launch a procurement process for the continued provision of the services for a maximum of four years. This will apply after the temporary contract has expired. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I will continue to engage closely with aviation stakeholders, including representatives of the airports in Kerry and Donegal, to keep them informed of plans in this regard. I am happy to advise Deputies that a number of airlines have already been in contact to indicate their interest in operating these routes. The Government is fully cognisant of the ongoing and deep impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector and has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including those in the aviation sector. These supports are unprecedented and include the wage subsidy scheme, the waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS. Liquidity funding is also available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund. This is also being availed of. Taking all of these supports into account, it is estimated that more than €450 million will have been made available to the sector by the end of June. I acknowledge the importance of providing clarity on the extent and duration of the employment supports beyond the end of June. Airlines have been reassured that there will be no cliff edge in the horizontal State supports that have been available from the start of the pandemic. The Government has also allocated funding of €80 million for an aviation-specific support package in 2021. This represents a quadrupling of the funding provided to our regional airports and in support of our PSO services for Donegal and Kerry in a normal year. Some €21 million of this funding is being provided to our smaller regional airports at Donegal, Knock and Kerry under the new regional airports programme for the period 2021-2025. Furthermore, in acknowledgement of the severe impacts on our two State regional airports and in recognition of the importance of these airports in the south-west and mid-west regions which they serve, an unprecedented €32 million is being made available to support the airports at Cork and Shannon this year. This level of funding to our State airports is unprecedented as Ireland's State airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon operate under a commercial mandate and, ordinarily, do not benefit from Exchequer support. In recognition of the impact of Covid-19 on all our airports, schemes that are compliant with state aid rules have also been developed following extensive engagement with the European Commission by my Department. Under these schemes, a further allocation of up to €6 million is available to the airports at Donegal, Kerry and Knock. These schemes also include €20 million in compensation for the State airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon. This funding will provide State airports with flexibility to roll out route incentives and charge rebates in consultation with airlines with a view to supporting the recovery and growth of connectivity. My Department is currently assessing applications for this funding and hopes to be in a position to disburse this compensation in the coming weeks. Additional funding that might be necessary for our regional State airports at Cork and Shannon will be considered in the context of the Estimates process this year in respect of budget 2022. Government fully accepts and is willing to keep under review any additional supports in this sector, if required. Deputies will be aware that the economic recovery plan published by Government on 1 June explicitly references this and recognises that additional supports may be required to support the aviation sector's recovery as it opens up. The regional airports programme published by Government in February provides certainty for the airports that deliver connectivity to the regions for the next four years. Donegal Airport, Kerry Airport and Ireland West Airport, Knock, are eligible for funding under this programme. In addition to targeting the funding of safety and security projects and activities, the scope of the new programme has been expanded to encourage airports to reduce emissions and build climate resilience. The programme honours commitments in the programme for Government, which recognises the value of aviation to economic development, international connectivity and tourism, to deliver funding that will support services and ensure safety at our regional airports. All eligible capital projects submitted for funding by our regional airports were approved this year. Some €2 million in grant funding has been made available to deliver runway upgrade works and a new fire training centre in Knock. More than €1.7 million in funding has been provided to Kerry Airport to deliver replacement vehicles and CCTV upgrade works. Almost €900,000 in funding has been provided to Donegal Airport to fund a new fire truck and other projects including runway lighting. Projects supported under the €32 million regional State airports programme, to which I referred earlier, include a runway overlay project at Cork Airport. This is currently being assessed but, given the costs involved, this project is subject to appraisal under the public spending code. Pending a satisfactory evaluation, I hope to be in a position to formally approve funding of €10 million for this project in the coming weeks. The funding that Government will provide to Cork Airport has allowed this project to be brought forward to this year. This is a vital and strategic project for Cork Airport and the management of the airport aims to complete the project within ten weeks, taking the opportunity to complete it while passenger numbers are suppressed so the airport can be ready to operate in an unconstrained manner once it reopens on completion of the works at the end of November. Projects costing more than €6 million are also being supported at Shannon Airport this year. These include an airfield rehabilitation project and upgrades to security scanners and security screening. This funding is being provided in addition to €6 million in funding allocated to Shannon Airport for a hold baggage screening project last year. Both of these airports will also benefit from operational funding of €15.6 million this year. I assure Deputies that the Government is committed to continuing to support this sector. The Minister and I have engaged extensively with all aviation stakeholders, including through the aviation recovery task force, the National Civil Aviation Development Forum and the aviation subgroup of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, which I chair. It is clear from this engagement that the single most important factor for Irish aviation is the earliest and widest reopening of international travel possible, subject to public health considerations. The main requirement of all aviation stakeholders has been clarity on a plan to permit the resumption of non-essential international air travel. This has now been addressed with the Government announcement on 26 May of a roadmap for the gradual reopening of international travel on 19 July. The current advice to avoid non-essential travel and related penalties will remain in place until 18 July. However, from 19 July, citizens will be advised to travel safely and in accordance with public health guidance and restrictions and to avoid non-essential travel to countries in which an emergency brake has been applied. From 19 July, we will also operate the EU digital Covid certificate for travel originating within the EU or the EEA. This certificate will show if a passenger is vaccinated against Covid-19, has recovered from Covid-19 or has a negative test result. All passengers will be advised to observe public health restrictions and to present for post-arrival testing if they develop symptoms. Furthermore, from 19 July Ireland will also broadly align itself to the EU approach to non-essential travel into the EU from third countries outside the EU or the EEA. To protect its citizens against the importation of variants, an emergency brake mechanism will be co-ordinated at EU level to react swiftly to the emergence of a variant of concern or variant of interest. It is important to point out that, with regard to third countries such as the US and UK, strict travel restrictions remain in place. The US, for example, continues to limit entry for non-essential travel. For travellers entering the UK from outside the common travel area from countries on the green list, a negative test is required, carried out up to 72 hours in advance of travel, with a further requirement for a test up to two days following arrival.For travellers from countries on the UK's amber or red lists, there is a requirement to quarantine and take two Covid tests. Mandatory hotel quarantine applies for those arriving from red-listed countries. These requirements apply to all those entering the UK from outside the common travel area, even those who have been vaccinated. I and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, along with my departmental officials, will continue to engage at every level across Government to ensure that all options relating to testing which strike the right balance between protecting public health and protecting our economy are considered. That same balance applies to aviation and maritime transport. I highlight that during the normal regular engagements at interdepartmental level, including with the CMO, the Department of Health and the HSE, my Department has consistently highlighted the need to reopen international travel as soon as possible in a manner that continues to protect public health. The possible use of antigen testing for the purpose of reopening international travel has been suggested by my Department on several occasions. I most recently raised this issue in the context of correspondence to senior Ministers on 11 May to set out a number of issues that required urgent clarification in the context of the Government's consideration of the aviation restart plan. This included consideration of antigen testing to replace PCR tests for international travel, perhaps on a pilot basis initially. However, to date, the public health advice, which is based on World Health Organization advice, has been that the use of antigen testing is not suitable for the purposes of supporting international travel. The advice has been that while antigen testing may play a role as an added screening measure in some settings, such as the workplace, it is not considered appropriate for international travel. I note the comments made by the CMO yesterday and will continue to be guided by the Department of Health and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, with regard to testing.	spk_247
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-17	dail	33	Regional Airports and Aviation: Statements	dbsect_32	I thank the Deputies for contributing to this debate. I fully understand and appreciate the level of concern raised by all Deputies regarding connectivity to our regions, the pressure that those in the aviation sector are under and the impact on all of those who have lost their jobs. I can assure all of those involved in the sector that the Government is fully committed to helping the sector get back on its feet. There will be no cliff edge in the horizontal supports that have been available from the start of the pandemic to this industry. The Government will continue to monitor and review the direct supports to the airports and any further supports that may be considered necessary, as we have acknowledged in the economic recovery plan. I recognise also the importance of providing clarity on the extent and duration of the supports beyond 2021. In this context, the Government will continue to monitor and consider what further supports may be needed to help all regional airports, including Shannon and Cork, as part of the upcoming Estimates process. A recent report from the Central Bank on Covid-19 and the public finances in Ireland outlined that the fiscal support package introduced in Ireland was large in a euro area context, with the increase in primary Government spending in Ireland the second highest in the euro area in the first three quarters of last year. The report found that the fiscal measures introduced have mitigated the impact of the pandemic on households, firms and the broader economy. This supports the Government’s policy of providing horizontal financial supports with a view to mitigating the impact of the pandemic on the broader economy. The Government is confident that this strategy will facilitate a speedy recovery of all sectors, including aviation, as soon as restrictions are lifted. As I mentioned earlier, the programme for Government acknowledges the value of aviation in supporting economic development, international connectivity and tourism via our airports. Getting international travel back up and running is vital for the continued economic well-being of this country and will continue to be a priority for me and this Government. I hear what Deputies have said in regard to antigen testing. As I said in my opening statement, I and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will continue to engage at every level across government to ensure that all options in regard to testing are considered which strike the right balance between protecting public health and protecting our economy. We will continue to be guided by the Department of Health and NPHET in regard to Covid-19 testing and how it might be used in settings, including in regard to international travel. I assure Deputies that the Government is committed to supporting the regions and regional connectivity, and that is why we have moved quickly to seek to reinstate these services lost to Donegal and Kerry, about which I share the concerns of Deputies, as well as committing to renewing the PSO services on these routes under a new contract for up to a further four years. The funding that has been made available to these airports in 2021 is a clear indication of the importance the Government attaches to airports being well-positioned to weather the current crisis for the recovery and growth into the future. It is worth noting that the capital funding of €900,000 to Donegal Airport, €2.2 million to Knock Airport and €1.7 million to Kerry Airport, which I announced on 19 April under the regional airports programme, represented funding of 100% of all eligible projects submitted by airports this year. In addition, I have asked airports to give further consideration to projects with a sustainability focus, which will help expedite airports’ efforts to reduce emissions in line with the goal to move towards carbon neutrality. These additional projects submitted are currently being evaluated by my Department. I am fully aware of the devastating impact of Covid-19 on Shannon Airport, like all airports in Ireland and around the world, and the importance to the mid-west of having strategic routes from Shannon Airport to London Heathrow, a European hub airport and the US. Prior to the pandemic, Shannon Group was delivering on its commercial mandate, improving profitability and recording strong growth in its commercial property company. While the impact of Covid-19 left Shannon Group in a very vulnerable position, the general Covid-19-related supports put in place by the Government and the specific Government supports targeted at Shannon Airport, which totalled some €30 million in 2020 and 2021, should serve to secure the position of the group and aid its recovery. In a positive development, I can advise Deputies that Ryanair resumed scheduled air services at Shannon Airport on 1 June, and flights operating include those to the UK, Poland, Lithuania and Spain. Shannon Airport has also advised me that Ryanair services from the airport will increase from July. Regarding the restoration of other routes and the introduction of new air services, I understand the Shannon to London Heathrow route operated by Aer Lingus is expected to be back in September. I also understand Aer Lingus has indicated its intent to come back on transatlantic routes and that Shannon Airport is working hard to get its transatlantic routes back. Regarding the appointment of a new chair to the Shannon Group, a selection process is under way by the Public Appointments Service, which is expected to bring forward a shortlist of suitable candidates to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for his consideration shortly, and the appointment will be made as soon as possible thereafter. The programme for Government commitment seeks to ensure that local development plans are developed to stimulate economic activity for those areas that were expecting economic development arising from new fossil fuel infrastructure and, as part of this, consider the potential of the Shannon Estuary in terms of regional economic development across transport and logistics, manufacturing, renewable energy and tourism, and develop a strategy to achieve this potential with support from the Exchequer. The Tánaiste will make an announcement on this programme for Government commitment to establish a Shannon Estuary task force over the coming weeks. I acknowledge that the anticipated closure of the airport in Cork from 12 September to 22 November this year will be highly disruptive for many in the Cork region. However, taking a range of factors into consideration, Cork Airport decided that the optimal approach for completing this project would be to close the airport for ten weeks, rather than risk restricting works to night-time hours only, which would push out the project's delivery timescale to nine months. The airport has engaged extensively with airline customers and stakeholders on this issue, and the vast majority of those stakeholders were in support of the airport's approach. Delivering the runway project over the shorter time period is safer in both construction and aeronautical terms, will have the lowest impact on passengers and airlines, and is the most cost-effective option when compared with the alternative night-time closure option. The runway upgrade is a complex and large project that also involves a full renewal of all the airside electrical systems. Given the costs involved, the project falls within the scope of the public spending code and, given the detailed procurement process involved for an infrastructure project of this scale and the requirements under the public spending code, it would not be feasible to bring this project forward any earlier than is currently planned. While I know this sector has greatly suffered and is continuing to be impacted by Covid-19, I am optimistic that the aviation sector can and will bounce back, and will help to drive Ireland's economic recovery and facilitate a return to growth as restrictions are gradually eased in the coming weeks.	spk_273
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-15	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_34	I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the Government's supports for local authorities, with particular reference to County Cork.The All-Ireland Research Observatory, AIRO, report the Deputy refers to was received by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on 9 June and is under consideration by officials. It is a wide-ranging report which covers funding from a variety of different Departments for a range of issues and schemes. Many of the funding lines are outside the remit of the Department. The report has also been sent for consideration to other relevant Government Departments. The funding system for local authorities is complex with authorities deriving their income from a variety of sources, including local sources such as commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from central Government. Most of the funding from central Government must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into five broad programme categories: recreational, education, environment, housing and transport. On funding streams specifically from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Housing, €135.3 million and €167.5 million was provided to Cork County Council in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The increase between 2019 and 2020 is due to an increase in housing funding, as well as funding in respect of the Covid-19 commercial rates and other Covid-19 related expenses which occurred in 2020. It is a matter for each local authority to consider how it can maximise local income sources and manage its own spending in the context of the annual budgetary process. Local authority members may decide, as part of the process, to vary the annual rates on valuation, ARV, and local property tax, LPT, in order to increase the revenue available to them. I note for 2020 and 2021, Cork County Council raised its LPT rate by 5% and 7.5%, respectively, forgoing the maximum 15% raise, or just over €3 million in 2020 and €2.4 million in 2021. I also refer to the recently announced plans to reform the local property tax. These reforms will involve bringing new homes which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system, as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within their county. This will be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, recently published the heads of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021. The Bill will give effect to a package of measures, in line with the programme for Government, to address the future of the local property tax. The legislation required to implement those changes falls under the remit of the Department of Finance, as a tax policy matter, and will be considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, also signalled the Government's intent to move to 100% local retention from 2023. Any changes to the allocation process may be considered in that context.	spk_299
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-15	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_34	That report was received by the Department on 9 June and is under consideration. I will be relaying Deputy Moynihan's message to the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien. As I stated, the report has also been shared with other Departments. I refer to the unprecedented support for local authorities during the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the earliest priorities of the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, was to secure funding to provide a waiver of commercial rates for businesses impacted by the pandemic, while supporting local authorities. In 2020, Cork County Council applied a 100% commercial rates waiver to just over 9,000 businesses and recouped €34.7 million from this Department. In recognition of Covid-19-related income losses and additional Covid-19-related expenditure incurred in 2020, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provided funding of €6.7 million to Cork County Council. Given the ongoing impacts of Covid-19, the Government's support for local authorities continues. The Government has introduced a commercial rates waiver for 2021, which has been extended to the end of September, at an estimated cost of €480 million. This waiver applies to businesses most seriously affected by ongoing restrictions. As with all public health measures and associated supports, the waiver of commercial rates will be kept under review, as has been the case since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Department will continue to engage with the local government sector and individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic and provide them with the necessary financial supports.	spk_303
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-15	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_34	I am delighted to have the opportunity to update the House on what the Government is doing regarding the sudden announcement by Stobart Air that it was ceasing operations. I refer to the impact of this announcement on connectivity to Kerry and Donegal, Government support for the aviation sector and affected employees, and the current crisis in the aviation industry and its impact on the mid-west. As Deputies will be aware, Stobart Air contacted the Department in the early hours of Saturday morning to advise that it was terminating the franchise agreement with Aer Lingus and its wet lease agreement with British Airways, BA, with immediate effect. This resulted in all Aer Lingus regional flights to the United Kingdom operated by Stobart Air also ceasing with immediate effect. Regrettably, Stobart Air's plans to secure a new buyer failed over the weekend and this action resulted in Stobart Air commencing a process of voluntary liquidation. The announcement is deeply regrettable in respect of the 480 Stobart Air workers directly impacted by this decision. The restoration of regional connectivity is of critical importance to the Government. The market has already moved to fill some of the lost routes, with Aer Lingus and BA CityFlyer now operating temporary replacement services which will cover most of the affected routes operating out of Dublin and Belfast City airports. Together with rerouting options, this will allow passengers impacted by the situation to return home. Regarding the PSO air services from Dublin to Donegal and Kerry, work is under way in my Department to launch an emergency procurement process to try to restore air services on these vital regional routes as soon as possible. My Department plans to issue a request for quotes directly to airlines in the coming days in accordance with applicable EU rules on air service public service obligations. It is anticipated the emergency procurement process will be completed by early July with a view to services being recommenced by the new operator or operators as soon as possible thereafter. The new contract will be subject to a maximum term of seven months and will operate according to EU law. To mitigate any further disruption to these services, my Department will also launch a procurement process, for a maximum of four years, for the continued provision of the services after the temporary contract has expired. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I will continue to engage closely with aviation stakeholders, including those in Kerry and Donegal airports, to keep them informed of plans in this regard. I am happy to advise that several airlines have been in contact to indicate their interest in operating these routes. The Government is aware of the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector and it has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including the aviation sector. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, the waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS. Liquidity funding is also available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund for medium and large enterprises, and this is being availed of. The Government also allocated funding of €80 million for aviation-specific support in 2021 in recognition of the impact of Covid-19 on our smallest airports in Donegal, Kerry and Knock. In addition to the €21 million in funding under the regional airports programme, a further allocation of up to €6 million to regional airports under a state aid compliant scheme will also be available in 2021. Applications for funding under this scheme are being assessed by my Department and I hope to be able to allocate funding in the coming weeks. In acknowledgement of the severe impacts on our two State regional airports and in recognition of the importance of these airports to the south west and mid-west regions they serve, an unprecedented €32 million is also being provided in support to Cork and Shannon airports this year. Additionally, my Department is assessing applications for funding of these airports and Dublin Airport under a €20 million Covid-19 supplementary support scheme, and I expect to be able to provide funding under this scheme shortly. This support will allow the airports the flexibility to provide route incentives and airport charge rebates to stimulate recovery and lost connectivity.	spk_312
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-15	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_34	In response to Deputy Cairn's concerns regarding employees, I chair a subgroup of the Labour Employer Economic Forum comprising representatives of employers and employees within aviation, which is examining the further needs of the sector. There are also references in the national economic recovery plan to additional supports for the aviation sector, if required. All of this is under consideration. I am aware of the stresses and concerns for employees in the sector but the Government has acted quickly. We have been watching the situation closely. What we wanted to do straightaway when Covid struck was to protect our airports and infrastructure to make sure they were in a position to rebound through this. On the PSO and expediting that process, we engaged on that over the weekend. Officials have been engaging with the European Commission on that process. I assure Deputies that the process will happen as fast as possible. This week the Department will write directly to airlines. They will need a week to reply but every effort is being made to expedite the process. I am hopeful that by the time we open up international travel on 19 July, we will have those routes in place, all going well.  On the issue of the market responding, it is a positive step that the market responds and is a good sign for Ireland. We should look at that positively. The fact that the market stepped in and that there are expressions of interest for the PSO routes is positive. The Deputies can be assured that regional connectivity and restoring international travel in a safe way are priorities for Government.	spk_317

As Deputies will be aware, Stobart Air contacted the Department in the early hours of Saturday morning to advise that it was terminating the franchise agreement with Aer Lingus and its wet lease agreement with British Airways, BA, with immediate effect. This resulted in all Aer Lingus regional flights to the United Kingdom operated by Stobart Air also ceasing with immediate effect. Regrettably, Stobart Air's plans to secure a new buyer failed over the weekend and this action resulted in Stobart Air commencing a process of voluntary liquidation. The announcement is deeply regrettable in respect of the 480 Stobart Air workers directly impacted by this decision. The restoration of regional connectivity is of critical importance to the Government. The market has already moved to fill some of the lost routes, with Aer Lingus and BA CityFlyer now operating temporary replacement services which will cover most of the affected routes operating out of Dublin and Belfast City airports. Together with rerouting options, this will allow passengers impacted by the situation to return home. Regarding the PSO air services from Dublin to Donegal and Kerry, work is under way in my Department to launch an emergency procurement process to try to restore air services on these vital regional routes as soon as possible. My Department plans to issue a request for quotes directly to airlines in the coming days in accordance with applicable EU rules on air service public service obligations. It is anticipated the emergency procurement process will be completed by early July with a view to services being recommenced by the new operator or operators as soon as possible thereafter. The new contract will be subject to a maximum term of seven months and will operate according to EU law. To mitigate any further disruption to these services, my Department will also launch a procurement process, for a maximum of four years, for the continued provision of the services after the temporary contract has expired. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I will continue to engage closely with aviation stakeholders, including those in Kerry and Donegal airports, to keep them informed of plans in this regard. I am happy to advise that several airlines have been in contact to indicate their interest in operating these routes. The Government is aware of the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector and it has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including the aviation sector. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, the waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS. Liquidity funding is also available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund for medium and large enterprises, and this is being availed of. The Government also allocated funding of €80 million for aviation-specific support in 2021 in recognition of the impact of Covid-19 on our smallest airports in Donegal, Kerry and Knock. In addition to the €21 million in funding under the regional airports programme, a further allocation of up to €6 million to regional airports under a state aid compliant scheme will also be available in 2021. Applications for funding under this scheme are being assessed by my Department and I hope to be able to allocate funding in the coming weeks. In acknowledgement of the severe impacts on our two State regional airports and in recognition of the importance of these airports to the south west and mid-west regions they serve, an unprecedented €32 million is also being provided in support to Cork and Shannon airports this year. Additionally, my Department is assessing applications for funding of these airports and Dublin Airport under a €20 million Covid-19 supplementary support scheme, and I expect to be able to provide funding under this scheme shortly. This support will allow the airports the flexibility to provide route incentives and airport charge rebates to stimulate recovery and lost connectivity.	spk_312
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-15	dail	33	Aviation Industry	dbsect_38	In response to Deputy Cairn's concerns regarding employees, I chair a subgroup of the Labour Employer Economic Forum comprising representatives of employers and employees within aviation, which is examining the further needs of the sector. There are also references in the national economic recovery plan to additional supports for the aviation sector, if required. All of this is under consideration. I am aware of the stresses and concerns for employees in the sector but the Government has acted quickly. We have been watching the situation closely. What we wanted to do straightaway when Covid struck was to protect our airports and infrastructure to make sure they were in a position to rebound through this. On the PSO and expediting that process, we engaged on that over the weekend. Officials have been engaging with the European Commission on that process. I assure Deputies that the process will happen as fast as possible. This week the Department will write directly to airlines. They will need a week to reply but every effort is being made to expedite the process. I am hopeful that by the time we open up international travel on 19 July, we will have those routes in place, all going well.  On the issue of the market responding, it is a positive step that the market responds and is a good sign for Ireland. We should look at that positively. The fact that the market stepped in and that there are expressions of interest for the PSO routes is positive. The Deputies can be assured that regional connectivity and restoring international travel in a safe way are priorities for Government.	spk_317

It contains a number of recommendations focusing primarily on legislative, structural and resourcing measures to enhance the capacity of agency and multi-agency enforcement, and the prevention of corruption and white-collar crime. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, published the cross-government plan on implementing the Hamilton review on 19 April 2021. The implementation plan sets out 22 actions to be completed by State agencies and Departments to progress the Hamilton report’s recommendations within the next year and a half, and sets timelines for the completion of these actions. The actions in the implementation plan include an advisory council against economic crime and corruption to advise and make proposals on strategic and policy responses that will be established at the centre of Government by the autumn; a multi-annual strategy to combat economic crime and corruption will be developed and submitted to Cabinet by next spring; and a resourcing plan for the long-term needs of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau will be submitted by An Garda Síochána to the Policing Authority and Department of Justice by this summer. Legislation to extend the surveillance powers currently available to An Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners to other bodies with a remit to investigate economic crime and corruption is to be developed by the end of this year, among other legislative proposals. I can inform the Deputy that work is under way in my Department to establish a cross-sector, partnership-based advisory council against economic crime and corruption to lead implementation of the action plan, including the establishment of a forum of operational representatives.	spk_102

Under the justice plan 2021, my Department is committed to supporting and working with Dublin City Council, DCC, to ensure the implementation of the report on Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview. As the Deputy is aware, DCC commissioned this report in response to the escalating levels of violence in these areas of north Dublin in 2019 and 2020. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the areas’ assets, services, and significant levels of State supports, as well as its inherent challenges. The Darndale implementation oversight group was established in February of this year and meets monthly, and is chaired by former Assistant Garda Commissioner Jack Nolan. The importance placed on the implementation of the report by An Garda Síochána is demonstrated by the presence of the local chief superintendent, superintendent and inspector, all of whom sit on the group. Further reflecting the importance of this work, the implementation group and my Department have agreed that the Department will also now be part of this group. While many of the report's recommendations relate to issues such as youth services, drugs services, the physical environment and community services and facilities, I am informed that implementation of the Garda actions is well under way, including the community hub proposal. As well as important recommendations related to crime prevention and dismantling gangs, two key recommendations include the need to strengthen community participation and leadership, and the need for more collaboration in the delivery of State services. This closely aligns with the work my Department is undertaking to develop a new community safety policy in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. This new policy will ensure communities are safer and feel safer by making community safety a whole-of-government responsibility and priority, to be delivered at a local level through community safety partnerships, supported through a national governance structure. Three pilot partnerships are being established in Dublin's north inner city, Longford and Waterford and will run for the next two years.	spk_108

These partnerships are community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives. There are 105 Garda youth diversion projects nationally and the intention is to further develop the service so it is available to every child in the State who could benefit from this. On the budget for the Garda youth diversion projects, €18 million of funding has been provided in 2021 with a further allocation of €3 million for the Greentown pilot projects, the bail supervision scheme and the University of Limerick research evidence into policy, programmes and practice project.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-03	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_21	I am advised by local Garda management that it is continually monitoring and preparing all policing plans pertaining to the Coolock area in line with the needs of the community. This includes having regular liaisons with resident groups and taking into account evolving crime trends. The Deputy is correct that this issue needs to be monitored and we have to ensure that the outputs are meeting the needs of the local community. Prior to Covid, local Garda management conducted numerous clinics on a weekly basis, which served as an important conduit between the force and the local community. Despite the pandemic, and in line with Government guidelines, liaison continues between the Garda and the local community through online platforms where possible, supporting and assisting the most vulnerable in the community. With the further easing of restrictions and new public health measures being announced, local Garda management is currently reviewing a plan to reinstate a full community policing engagement programme. It is envisaged that all Garda clinics will be reinstated in the coming months, with the addition of a new Garda clinic based at the Darndale Belcamp Village Centre to serve the surrounding communities. Discussions have also been taking place with stakeholders and community leaders.	spk_112

The Government is fully committed to combating domestic violence in all its forms. I am acutely aware of the effects of these awful crimes and there was a significant increase in calls to An Garda Síochána in this regard in 2020. Recommendation 1.3 from Supporting a Victim's Journey is focused on developing better inter-agency co-operation and communication and suggests three sub-actions to deliver on this. The first is to conduct an audit of how responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services are segmented. A draft report was recently submitted to both the Department of Children Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Justice and has been finalised.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-03	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_21	Regarding the figures for Operation Faoiseamh, which began at the start of the pandemic, An Garda Síochána and the Government have put a major focus on this area. An Garda Síochána received approximately 43,500 calls to respond to domestic abuse incidents in 2020, which was an increase of 17%. More than 4,000 criminal charges were created in 2020 for breaches of orders under the Domestic Violence Act 2018, which is an increase of 24%. The Garda received approximately 10,000 calls to respond to domestic abuse incidents in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 7%, and more than 1,000 criminal charges were created in the first quarter of this year for breaches of orders under the Domestic Violence Act 2018. The increase in reported incidents during the restrictions, together with the proactive approach taken by An Garda Síochána, has resulted in more files being referred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for prosecution. This demonstrates that Operation Faoiseamh is working and it reinforces the message that perpetrators cannot act with impunity. Regarding the audit, I expect it to come before me very shortly and I will be discussing the report with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman. I completely comprehend the urgency regarding this matter and it is a priority for the Department.	spk_127

Deputy Connolly raised this issue yesterday, as she said, in respect of funding for refuge spaces. That falls within the remit of Tusla and it has undertaken a review of the need for refuge spaces and other accommodation. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is committed to ensuring that the needs of service users are met and that the recommendations of the review inform strategic actions under the third national strategy for domestic sexual and gender-based violence. Tusla also continues its ongoing engagement with all its funded service providers regarding service needs and supports, as the Deputy is aware. There are some 60 services throughout the country and we are acutely aware that the housing crisis is placing additional pressures on refuges and is making identifying longer-term services more difficult. Tusla has also advised that the length of stay for women and families in refuges has increased due to the lack of appropriate move-on accommodation. I assure the Deputy, however, that we are doing much work at Government level concerning that audit and also regarding supporting victims' journeys. A great deal of work is happening in that area and its progression is a priority for me.	spk_129
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-03	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_21	I thank the Deputy for her question. As she said, the programme for Government contains a commitment to increase diversity within An Garda Síochána, prioritising the identification and removal of barriers to recruiting and retaining people from diverse and minority backgrounds. This work is being taken forward as part of An Garda Síochána's equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, strategy. The Garda Commissioner and the Secretary General of my Department are leading on this issue across the public service. My Department's Justice Plan 2021 commits to supporting the EDI strategy to ensure An Garda Síochána can attract, retain and develop a diverse and inclusive workforce, including preparation of a diversity recruitment roadmap. This roadmap will be informed by the ongoing work of An Garda Síochána to identify key challenges related to the recruitment and retention of individuals from minority backgrounds. The EDI strategy sets out 11 strategic goals to be met by the end of this year to increase equality, diversity and inclusion within the Garda organisation, including the establishment of governance structures to ensure the strategy's goals are met. The EDI leadership council, chaired by the newly appointed deputy commissioner with responsibility for strategy, governance and performance and comprising colleagues from across the public sector, including my Department, and academia, has been established to oversee this work, including addressing the issue of greater diversity in recruitment within the Garda. The Deputy will be pleased that the EDI strategy also provides for the establishment of an internship programme for both school-leavers and graduates. The aim of this programme is to attract graduates and school-leavers from communities that have been traditionally under-represented within An Garda Síochána. To support the objective of attracting, developing and retaining individuals of talent and representation from minority and diverse communities, the Garda national diversity and inclusion unit, GNDIU, in conjunction with the Garda human resources, equality, diversity and inclusion section, is actively engaging with representatives of minority groups.	spk_178

That training includes contributions from a number of minority communities as well as NGOs. The training will be delivered to both Garda members and staff and will build on the diversity training embedded into all aspects of the BA in applied policing that is undertaken by all trainee and probationer gardaí. The training will support the delivery of a human rights-based policing service to diverse communities in a non-discriminatory and professional manner. This is a key target of the Garda diversity and integration strategy for 2019 to 2021. There are currently 281 Garda diversity officers located across the country. In addition, the GNDIU is available to assist and support all members on the front line. The unit monitors hate crime and hate-related incidents via PULSE, engages with social and written media on developing policy and strategy, and advises and supports investigators.	spk_180

There is ongoing communication between different groups, including, for example, the Cavan Cross Cultural Community, Dublin City Interfaith Forum, The Federation for Victim Assistance, the Garda Traveller advisory group, the Immigrant Council of Ireland and the Irish Criminal Justice and Disability Network. There is significant engagement between a number of sectors and An Garda Síochána to ensure the strategy is rolled out.	spk_182

This roadmap will be informed by the ongoing work of An Garda Síochána to identify key challenges related to the recruitment and retention of individuals from minority backgrounds. The EDI strategy sets out 11 strategic goals to be met by the end of this year to increase equality, diversity and inclusion within the Garda organisation, including the establishment of governance structures to ensure the strategy's goals are met. The EDI leadership council, chaired by the newly appointed deputy commissioner with responsibility for strategy, governance and performance and comprising colleagues from across the public sector, including my Department, and academia, has been established to oversee this work, including addressing the issue of greater diversity in recruitment within the Garda. The Deputy will be pleased that the EDI strategy also provides for the establishment of an internship programme for both school-leavers and graduates. The aim of this programme is to attract graduates and school-leavers from communities that have been traditionally under-represented within An Garda Síochána. To support the objective of attracting, developing and retaining individuals of talent and representation from minority and diverse communities, the Garda national diversity and inclusion unit, GNDIU, in conjunction with the Garda human resources, equality, diversity and inclusion section, is actively engaging with representatives of minority groups.	spk_178
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-06-03	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_31	Members of An Garda Síochána will undertake training that covers hate crime and diversity awareness. That training includes contributions from a number of minority communities as well as NGOs. The training will be delivered to both Garda members and staff and will build on the diversity training embedded into all aspects of the BA in applied policing that is undertaken by all trainee and probationer gardaí. The training will support the delivery of a human rights-based policing service to diverse communities in a non-discriminatory and professional manner. This is a key target of the Garda diversity and integration strategy for 2019 to 2021. There are currently 281 Garda diversity officers located across the country. In addition, the GNDIU is available to assist and support all members on the front line. The unit monitors hate crime and hate-related incidents via PULSE, engages with social and written media on developing policy and strategy, and advises and supports investigators.	spk_180

Garda diversity forums have been established and they are going to liaise and communicate directly with different minority groups. There is ongoing communication between different groups, including, for example, the Cavan Cross Cultural Community, Dublin City Interfaith Forum, The Federation for Victim Assistance, the Garda Traveller advisory group, the Immigrant Council of Ireland and the Irish Criminal Justice and Disability Network. There is significant engagement between a number of sectors and An Garda Síochána to ensure the strategy is rolled out.	spk_182

I am glad to speak on a topic of concern for many public representatives, both local and national, and for people from the Galway area, as outlined by the Deputy. I spoke this afternoon to members of An Garda Síochána in Galway about the recent event in Salthill and events that may be planned for this weekend or other future dates. I also have spoken to the Galway city manager about this event. While the Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is operationally responsible for all policing matters, I am reassured that a policing plan is in place in anticipation of another Salthill Sunday event, if required. Local members of the Garda are also monitoring social media and will tailor any operations for this weekend or any other weekends as needed. Extra gardaí will be on duty around the city and in Salthill this weekend and they also will be carrying out spot checks.  Those of us from Galway are aware that these recent gatherings have understandably led to significant local concern. On Sunday last, a large number of vehicles gathered in Salthill village and Galway city as part of a Salthill Sunday event. Gardai from Salthill and Galway, together with resources from the divisional roads policing unit, implemented an operation for the management of the event. The public service vehicle inspector for the Galway division was also on duty. The Garda has informed me that 80 road traffic offences were detected by the roads policing unit and by uniformed members on duty at the event and that these will be actioned accordingly with fixed-charge penalty notices or summonses, as appropriate.  While An Garda Síochána has confirmed that there were no public order incidents of note, it has confirmed that the gathering of a large number of vehicles caused disruption to traffic. I fully appreciate the frustration which local people feel about any anti-social behaviour which there may have been around this event, and the concerns they may have in respect of future events.  I have been reassured today by An Garda Síochána in the Galway division that it will enforce legislation and ensure any breaches of legislation are prosecuted as they arise.  It is also important to note that the Garda is continuing to provide enhanced support to the public health effort to combat Covid-19. In this context, we are continuing to appeal to the public to avoid large gatherings and crowds at this time. Personal responsibility and compliance with the public health measures that remain in place continue to be key in minimising opportunities for the virus to spread.  I fully appreciate and it is important to say that in normal times, car enthusiasts may wish to gather and enjoy the company of like-minded people but I would ask that everyone adhere to the public health regulations and I appeal to the organisers of such events to consider the impact they are having on the local population in Salthill. I also ask people to refrain from meeting in large numbers and to follow the continuing public health advice and the necessary restrictions As our society and economy re-opens, we are also being asked to socialise outdoors and to make the most of our community spaces. With that in mind, all of us have a responsibility to residents in places such as Salthill to be respectful when we gather outdoors. I appreciate how difficult the past 15 months have been for everyone and how many sacrifices people have made to maximise our collective safety against Covid-19. I join all Deputies in welcoming the freedoms that have been restored in recent weeks. However, we are all called upon now to ensure that we can enjoy the outdoors as safely as possible and that we all take responsibility for our own actions.	spk_314

I was categorically assured today by An Garda Síochána on that point. There is engagement between the city council and the Garda, which was also confirmed to me today. I spoke to the city manager and I know that the local city councillors are directly engaging with An Garda Síochána locally around other solutions. Whatever resources the Garda needs, we have always said that we will support it in that. I will be guided by the local Garda information that I received and its members are saying that it will deploy all its resources, will be carrying out spot checks within the city and on the outskirts as well this weekend and will be monitoring the activities as they arise this weekend or over future weekends. Of course, this will be constantly monitored and we need to ensure that we support the Garda in whatever way possible. In my communications with the city council, I am happy to assist in any way I can.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-05-25	dail	33	International Travel and Aviation: Statements	dbsect_8	I join the Minister in thanking the House for allowing us to address the matter of international travel and aviation. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the announcement by Aer Lingus last week regarding its Shannon base. It is very regrettable that Aer Lingus has decided to close the Aer Lingus cabin crew base at Shannon Airport and to temporarily close its base at Cork Airport as well as embarking on a review of ground handling arrangements at those airports. However, it is also noted that many airlines across Europe are also implementing significant cost saving measures in light of the circumstances currently facing the industry. Reported job cuts in other European Airlines, for example KLM, Lufthansa and IAG is indicative of industry-wide restructuring across Europe. The unprecedented challenges being faced by Aer Lingus and their staff during this difficult time is also understood within this context and the cumulative impact of Covid-19 over the past 15 months. The Minister and I met with the CEO of Aer Lingus to discuss details of the announcement made by the company last week. We reiterated the Government's commitment to supporting the industry and acknowledged the importance of providing clarity on the extent and duration of the employment supports beyond the end of June. We reassured the airline that there would be no cliff edge in the horizontal State supports that have been available from the start of the pandemic. The meeting with the CEO last week also focused on the future operations of the company in Ireland. The CEO outlined the company's hopes for a resumption of travel from Cork and Shannon when the situation allows. I welcomed the confirmation by the CEO of Aer Lingus that there is no strategic intent to reduce connectivity at either Cork or Shannon while acknowledging that the restoration of services would depend on market circumstances. We also met with the CEOs of Shannon Group and Cork Airport last week to discuss the situation there. The support for the airports and their important role in regional development was reiterated at these meetings. This includes plans to explore the potential of the Shannon Estuary in terms of regional economic development across transport and logistics, manufacturing, renewable energy and tourism, and develop a strategy to achieve this potential, with support from the Exchequer, as set out under the programme for Government commitments. For its part, Cork Airport has taken the decision to undertake an extensive runway project in the region of €35 million-€40 million. This investment falls within the public spending code. This includes the development of a new electrical substation. Taking a range of factors into consideration, including consultation with stakeholders, Cork Airport decided that the optimal approach for completing this project would be to close the airport for ten weeks, significantly shortening the disruptive effect of project delivery from a timescale of nine months if carried out at night-time hours only. Last week, I took part in similar engagements with trade unions and employer representative groups in my capacity as chair of the aviation sub-group of the Labour Employer Economic Forum. This sub-group has been investigating the option of a specially extended wage subsidy scheme for the aviation sector, and this work will continue. I assure the House that the Government is committed to supporting the aviation sector. We recognise the importance of providing clarity on the extent and duration of supports beyond the end of June. Throughout this pandemic, Government has provided a significant level of general supports to the economy, with at least €300 million provided to the aviation sector alone through wage supports, business grants, tax and rates alleviations, and low interest loans. The bulk of this support is in the form of wage subsidies, which were designed to maintain the link between employers and their workers. In addition to these broad supports, the Government secured almost €80 million in Exchequer funds to help passenger airports navigate this crisis in 2021. This is almost four times the usual State provision to airports and includes, for the first time, significant assistance to Cork and Shannon airports. More than €32 million is being made available to these airports to help meet costs in the areas of safety and security and will contribute to the delivery of essential projects, such as the runway overlay project at Cork Airport. These airports will also benefit from a €20 million damages scheme that was approved by the EU in February, helping to compensate State airports for a portion of financial losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.This funding, which I expect to issue in the coming weeks, will give airports the flexibility to provide route incentives and airport charge rebates to stimulate recovery of lost connectivity this year. Aligned to this support is a five-year commitment to fund our smallest airports under a regional airports programme published in February of this year. This year, with a budget of over €21 million, Donegal, Kerry and Knock will receive grant aid in the areas of safety, security and sustainability. This amount will also cover the costs associated with air service public service obligations, PSOs, between the capital and our most peripheral airports in Donegal and Kerry. In addition to this €21 million, a further €6 million was secured under an EU state aid scheme to help small airports address liquidity issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. As evidenced by these interventions, the Government understands that aviation is a critical lifeline to the regions and will consider what further supports may be needed to help all of our regional airports, including Cork and Shannon, as part of the upcoming Estimates process. I am also alive to the hardship being experienced by those who depend on the aviation industry for their livelihoods, if not through job losses then through lower pay and income uncertainty. I can assure workers and all of those involved in the aviation industry that the Government will continue to support the industry and review the supports that may be required in the coming months. While we are not yet able to permit the restoration of international travel, work is under way to ensure that we are prepared. Until then, the Government will continue to provide supports to the aviation sector, as it does to all sectors of the economy. In order to protect our population from the worst effects of the virus and to enable our healthcare system to continue to function and provide essential front-line services, it has been necessary for the Government to take unprecedented action on public health measures. I also refer to the remarks last week from the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and concerns around the number of cases of the new Indian variant, suggesting that we must continue to be vigilant and maintain public health measures.  As we are now seeing, international travel is a route for the potential seeding of new Covid-19 cases and variants of concern while we persevere in managing community transmission. Mandatory hotel quarantine and PCR testing for international travel are among a suite of public health measures designed to mitigate this risk. Unfortunately, the impact is to the detriment of aviation and related economic sectors.  As a society, we have been rewarded for our efforts over the past few months in that we are now in a position to reopen our economy with some degree of caution. However, it is apparent, and this has been acknowledged in discussions with those employed in the aviation sector and their representative bodies, that the aviation sector will be one of the last sectors of the economy to take those initial steps of reopening. The Minister and I have, over the past 15 months, engaged with aviation industry representatives and the National Civil Aviation Development Forum. Last month, this group developed an aviation restart plan it believes will best provide for the restart and recovery of the aviation sector in Ireland. It includes the determination of the conditions, vaccination levels and epidemiological thresholds that allow for the de-escalation of public health measures relating to international travel. This will include a stepping down of mandatory quarantine, testing requirements and the advice against non-essential travel. It will also include clear communication of the Government's strategy for the lifting of these restrictions towards a targeted reopening at the appropriate time, a clear commitment to the implementation of the EU digital green certificate for vaccinated, tested and recovered persons as a means to free movement of EU citizens, travel within the common travel area, CTA, with the UK and between Ireland and certain third countries, in particular the United States, and the consideration of a pilot for antigen testing to replace PCR tests for international travel. I welcomed the recent aviation restart plan produced by the aviation industry participants in the National Civil Aviation Development Forum last month. I want to acknowledge the collaborative and constructive approach of the aviation industry representatives in working through the development of the proposals in the report. The report raises a number of issues for consideration in the context of the development of the Government's roadmap for reopening international travel. Proposals regarding the introduction of EU vaccine certificates will form a central plank of the Government's plan for recovery of the sector. I have also impressed on the industry the need to get visit visibility of how key stakeholders will ramp up operations incrementally as restrictions ease, while ensuring agreed public health and safety measures remain in effect. While acknowledging the primacy of the protection of public health, there is clearly an increasing need for a strategy for international travel that can serve as a basis to protect existing jobs, insofar as is possible, and to plan for the re-commencement of operations as soon as is practicably possible. I again thank the House for the opportunity to address it and look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on this important matter.	spk_99
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-05-25	dail	33	International Travel and Aviation: Statements	dbsect_8	I thank all the Deputies who made important contributions. I assure them the Government is acutely aware of the devastating impact Covid-19 is having on the aviation industry, on families and workers and on those who are impacted by the sector. I thank the Oireachtas joint committee for the work it has carried out in keeping this topic in the spotlight over the past 15 months through the various meetings that have been held during this time. This week, the committees, the Seanad and the Dáil have assisted in our understanding of the complexities of the needs and concerns of stakeholders in aviation and the public in balancing the economic impacts against the public health imperative. It is through such cross-governmental collaboration with the public interest at its heart that I believe we will navigate this crisis, with care and caution, towards an ultimate reopening of international travel. The Government is fully aware of the pressure those in aviation are under and the frustration present in the industry. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I will continue to engage with the aviation industry, the airports and the air carriers, individually and collectively through the national civil aviation development forum. A number of Deputies raised important issues and I addressed many of them in my opening statement. A number raised the midwest region and Shannon Airport. There is real concern in the midwest region about the lack of transatlantic flights and about the Heathrow slots. As I said earlier, Aer Lingus has assured the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and me there was no strategic intent to reduce connectivity out of Shannon Airport. I fully expected Aer Lingus to resume flights at Shannon Airport gradually as restrictions are eased over the coming months. I advise Deputies that in the coming weeks the Tánaiste will make an announcement as part of the programme for Government commitment to establish a Shannon estuary task force, recognising that Shannon Airport is a key economic driver and that the midwest region is critical. In total last year and this year, €30 million in Government supports has been made available to Shannon Group, through economy-wide supports and supports specific to the aviation sector. We have ensured that all of our aviation infrastructure, airports and regional airports have been supported and are in a position to be able to rebound and grow as we come out of this crisis. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I have placed a big emphasis on this over recent months. The Covid-19 virus is our shared concern and the public health objective is the starting point. The Government has consistently adopted a cautious approach to international travel and has worked to ensure any necessary air travel is done safely. There was some optimism last summer that aviation in Europe would have been well on its way to recovery by the end of 2020 but, unfortunately, this did not transpire. Instead, there were significant rates of infection throughout Europe and globally in the autumn. This was compounded by the importation of the B117 variant, which swept through the country following the partial reopening during Christmas, followed by other emerging variants of concern. Flight bans were introduced here for the first time as an emergency response to the new variant strains of Covid-19. These flight bans were quickly replaced by a pre-departure test requirement. As soon as possible thereafter, a system of mandatory quarantine was established in law. Despite some initial start-up issues, as expected with any new system, the mandatory quarantine system assisted in containing the seeding of new cases of Covid-19 and variants of concern in the State, while we endeavoured to manage persistent high rates of community transmission at the same time. However, the current course of Covid-19 means international travel is reduced to essential journeys only. In this context, the aviation sector is operating at very low levels of activity, as the House is well aware. The industry and its employees have shown great fortitude over the past 15 months in supporting the public health measures through implementing the protocols for passenger travel, Covid-19 proofing our airports and denying boarding at the gates to those passengers who do not comply with Ireland's public health measures. Through the labour employer economic forum, LEAF, process which I chair, involving employer and employee representative bodies, it has been acknowledged there will inevitably be a lag in aviation reopening compared to other economic sectors. However, we will continue to explore the supports needed to sustain industry in trading its way back to recovery when that time is signalled. In particular, the wage supports have been hugely important in maintaining the connection between employers and employees. There will be no cliff edge in State supports, as has been previously outlined. I encourage the aviation sector to continue to engage with me, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and departmental officials in the work in bringing forward proposals and in the preparation for a recovery and restart for international travel. Of course, we need a strong and sustainable economy in which international travel and aviation are central. However, the risk to public health remains the driver of the Government's response, planning and action. Ireland has a proud history in aviation and our reputation internationally is exceptional. It fits well with our culture of global citizenship and has always enabled the Irish diaspora to set its sights further beyond the immediate horizon. Aviation connects us with the world and we will strive to ensure that in future connectivity is maintained with Europe, the common travel area, on transatlantic routes and to many other global destinations. It is with this perspective that we will build back better and more resilient to face future shocks. The policies and targets we are setting now for sustainability and climate action will ensure this resilience. Our aviation industry, airports and air carriers will play an important role in this transition over time. In addition, balanced regional development is at the heart of our programme for Government. We recognise that all parts of Ireland must be able to prosper. The silence that has descended over our regional airports is indicative of the disproportionate impact a crisis such as this can have on the regions, particularly our smaller regional airports such as Donegal, Ireland West Airport Knock and Kerry. For this reason, out of a budget of almost €80 million in 2021 approximately 78% is being targeted at regional airports, with Cork and Shannon receiving almost 43% of the overall budget. We will continue to do what we can to support these airports and we will keep the situation under constant review as part of budget 2022. With regard to the immediate crisis and the need to get international travel back up and running, this is vital for the continued economic well-being of the country and remains a priority for the Government. However, this can only be accomplished through the consideration of the progression of Covid-19, the national vaccination programme, developments at EU and international level and our public health advice. The Government will set out its position this week.	spk_139
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Climate Change Policy	dbsect_17	"Legislation to provide for the introduction of the mandatory quarantine system recently entered into force. Contractual arrangements have now been finalised and it is the intention of the Government to commence the operation of mandatory quarantine this week. The Department of Health is leading this process, supported by officials from several Departments, including the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Transport, Justice and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and via input from the private sector. Passengers who have been in one of the designated states within 14 days of their arrival in Ireland must complete a mandatory 14-day quarantine in a designated facility. The 14-day period of quarantine can be reduced if travellers undergo testing on arrival and again on day ten and that testing does not return a positive for Covid-19. Mandatory quarantine applies to all passengers travelling from designated states, regardless of nationality, and includes Irish citizens. The aim of mandatory quarantine is to protect the population from challenges posed by new variants of concern. Turning to the other aspects of the Deputy's question, the Irish aviation sector is critical to the economic development of the country. It is a key enabler of international trade and business, including foreign direct investment and tourism. However, it is clear that the aviation sector in Ireland and internationally is currently experiencing the most challenging crisis in its history. Many analysts are predicting that it will take several years for the sector to return to 2019 levels of activity. Traffic in 2020 was down approximately 80% on 2019 levels and revenue has fallen dramatically. As the Deputy is aware, the Government has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including the aviation sector. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the Covid restrictions support scheme, the credit guarantee scheme and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, working capital scheme, with some of these now extended to 30 June 2021. Irish airlines and airports have availed of more than €200 million through these supports to date. Liquidity funding is also available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund for medium and large enterprises. As regards specific supports for employment, we have the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which is a key component of the Government's response to the Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment.
               The scheme has been extended to the end of June 2021. In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of €80 million specifically for Irish aviation in 2021. A part of this package, comprising more than €21 million, is being provided to the regional airports programme, RAP. The new RAP, which was published on 4 February, gives funding certainty to those airports up to 2025. The airports eligible for RAP support are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airport, Knock. In addition, €32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon airports through a new one-year Covid-19 regional State airports programme. The European Commission has approved under EU state aid rules a €26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by Covid-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread. This scheme consists of three measures: a damage compensation measure, an aid measure to support the airport operators up to a maximum of €1.8 million per beneficiary and an aid measure to support the uncovered fixed costs of these companies. The aid will take the form of direct grants. Airports will be invited to apply for funding under the scheme shortly. The scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and make a recovery from the impacts of Covid-19. The possibility that further targeted supports may be required later in 2021 cannot be excluded, particularly in the event that restrictions on travel remain in place throughout the forthcoming summer season. My officials and I have maintained regular contact with key stakeholders throughout this crisis. On 5 March 2021, I chaired a special meeting of the steering committee of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, NCADF. The NCADF, which was established through a recommendation of the national aviation policy in 2016, brings together senior stakeholders in the aviation industry, mostly at chief executive level. The meeting provided an opportunity for very constructive engagement with members of the committee, together with other senior leaders from Irish aviation. It is clear from my engagement with the aviation sector that the priority issue for all those involved in the industry is that of planning to progress, as a matter of urgency, to the reopening of international travel as soon as circumstances allow. To this end, a subgroup of the NCADF has been tasked with developing proposals for restart and recovery of the Irish aviation sector. It is anticipated that the subgroup will present its report to the steering group of the NCADF next month. The work of the NCADF will inform Government decisions on the restart and recovery of the Irish aviation sector, which will also have regard to developments at EU and international level, as well as public health advice. The Government is fully alert to the devastating impact of the global pandemic on international travel and values the critical role that aviation plays in the Irish economy. It is expected that it may be some time before it is possible to permit a large-scale return to air travel, but we remain committed to ensuring that the aviation sector can maintain the necessary core capability to retain strategic connectivity and to rebound quickly when circumstances allow."	spk_236

All Members understand the importance of aviation for Ireland as an island nation, including for foreign direct investment, tourism and connectivity as an island. I chaired a special meeting of the steering committee of the NCADF. My departmental officials maintain regular contact with the sector. The NCADF was established through the recommendation of the national aviation policy in 2016 and brings together all the key stakeholders within the aviation industry. That meeting provided a very constructive opportunity for that engagement around a roadmap for recovery at the appropriate time while obviously taking into account the public health measures and what is happening at EU and UK levels.The Deputy can be assured that every necessary support will be given. We are constantly watching and monitoring this matter. There is considerable uncertainty in Europe today. The numbers of people infected with Covid-19 have increased. This is not just an Irish issue, it is a global issue. I assure the Deputy the aviation sector is critical to the Government.	spk_240
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Climate Change Policy	dbsect_17	As I said earlier, the aviation industry is absolutely critical for Ireland and its foreign direct investment, tourism, economy and for the functioning of an island nation. This Government acted quickly when the pandemic broke last year and offered a large range of supports. The airlines and aviation sector have benefited from more than €200 million of that suite of supports. This is, obviously, an evolving crisis. It is going to take a number of years for the aviation industry to reach pre-Covid-19 levels of international travel. That is the opinion of key analysts and is widely recognised and accepted. It is critical we do everything we can and engage with all the stakeholders on a roadmap to that recovery when the time is right. That is what I am doing with my officials. We are meeting with the national civil aviation forum to work on that roadmap and pathway out when the time is right. There is too much uncertainty. As the Deputy knows, we have mandatory hotel quarantine starting this week in Ireland. We have an epidemiological situation at European and international levels that is concerning. We have done very well in Ireland in managing the virus but we have to ensure continually that we are monitoring it while preparing a roadmap for a route out when the time is right. There are supports in place and we will continue to engage with the sector, including our airports and airlines. I hear the Deputy's concerns around employment and that is why we have put in place a large range of supports, including the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the EWSS, and commercial rates waivers for the airlines. It is a difficult time and it is only through engaging with the key stakeholders that we will find that roadmap out. It will not be an easy road.	spk_242
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Climate Change Policy	dbsect_17	I must remind the Deputy of the uncertainty we are facing. We were all hopeful this time last year that we would be out of this pandemic within a number of months but that has not been the case. As I said, the Government acted fast by putting in supports and those measures are still there, including the PUP, the EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS. All of those are also available to the aviation sector. I know many people have lost their jobs. It is a really difficult time for many families. We need to try to protect as many jobs as we can, not only in the aviation sector but in every sector. That is done through the broad range of supports that are available across sectors, including the aviation industry. Working with the aviation stakeholders around what the recovery will look like is critical and that is what I am doing with my Department. It is difficult to see what that recovery will look like now, when we are in the middle of the pandemic, but that work is ongoing and proposals will be brought forward over the coming weeks.	spk_244
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Climate Change Policy	dbsect_17	I am equally concerned about protecting people's jobs.

Now is the time to be working on that and to protect as many jobs as possible. That is the work I am doing with my officials within the national civil aviation forum. There is a subgroup relating to bringing back proposals around what that reopening will look like. I must reiterate that it is a very uncertain time within a number of sectors. We know there are going to be changes and this is a moving roadmap as to what recovery will look like. In the meantime, we must try to support the industry as best we can and support that connectivity.

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Climate Change Policy	dbsect_17	The current public health emergency has had a profoundly disruptive effect on the learning and testing system in this country. I can assure the Deputy that the Department is very aware of the challenges facing the Road Safety Authority, RSA, as it works hard to manage the backlog in the driver testing and theory testing service. The driving test service is not currently operating as normal due to the impact of Covid-19. Tests are only available, under level 5 restrictions, to essential workers. This has had a significant impact on waiting times. RSA driver testers are undertaking driving tests in extraordinarily difficult conditions. The driving test is conducted in an enclosed space for a period of over 15 minutes, where physical distancing is not possible. Given the significant risk to testers when conducting a driving test, the Government has deemed that the driver testing service should be available only for essential workers in level 5 Covid-19 restrictions. Due to the suspension of driver testing services in the first 2020 lockdown, along with the health protocols since resumption of service and the further curtailing of services during subsequent level 5 restrictions, a significant backlog has developed. While the service is limited during level 5 restrictions, the RSA is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints with an eye to resuming wider testing after level 5. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog. Following discussions with the RSA, my Department has approved the hiring of a further 40 temporary testers for 22 months.The process of recruitment is now under way. However, it will take some time for people to be selected and trained. These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers which I previously gave sanction to rehire during 2020. The provision of extra testers will not on its own suffice to address the problem. One of the difficulties is with the capacity of test centres themselves, given limits on throughput due to Covid-19.	spk_248
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Climate Change Policy	dbsect_17	My understanding is that testing capacity is at the maximum allowed under public health advice. There is a limit to the number of tests that can be physically carried out each day due to the level 5 restrictions. Even with the hire of extra driver testers, that in itself will not help the current backlog due to the time involved and the limitations on the throughput in the centres. I assure Deputy O'Rourke that we are in constant contact with the RSA, which is working very hard to come up with ways to reduce the backlog when the level 5 restrictions are lifted in order to carry out more tests per day. Overtime is being considered to allow tests to be carried out later in the evening and at weekends. A number of measures are under consideration, but while level 5 restrictions are in place we are curtailed for public health reasons. We are trying to keep everybody safe - the instructor and the learner as well.	spk_250
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Climate Change Policy	dbsect_17	Deputy O'Rourke can be assured that whatever resources are needed in order to alleviate this backlog will be provided. I have sanctioned 40 extra testers and they should be in place by the end of June. Given the public health restrictions under level 5, there is a physical limit to the number of tests that can be undertaken. I assure the Deputy that if more testers are required then more will be sanctioned. We are in constant communication with the RSA on the matter. Public health is our primary concern. Every question the Deputy has raised relates to public health. I accept that it is very frustrating for people who are trying to progress with their driving lessons and to get their test but the reason for the backlog is due to Covid-19 and trying to protect people. The RSA and the testers have done a very good job on minimising the spread of the virus because of the protocols they have in place.	spk_252
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Climate Change Policy	dbsect_17	The primary function of State ports is to facilitate maritime transport, which is the most important means of connecting Ireland to international markets, accounting for more than 90% of Ireland's international trade, in volume terms. At the same time, it is recognised that there is a pressing need for Ireland to have the port capacity in place to exploit the opportunities presented by offshore renewable energy, ORE, with the programme for Government targeting a capacity of 5 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, met with Iarnród Éireann on 1 December 2020 and it outlined the potential for Rosslare Port to service the emerging offshore wind sector in Ireland and the scale of the investment in infrastructure needed depending on a number of options. Rosslare is unique among the State-owned ports, as it is not a commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts but is instead operated on a commercial basis as a division of Iarnród Éireann with all investments funded from port revenues. This is similar to other ports in Ireland which receive no Exchequer funding and must fund all their infrastructure developments through their own resources, borrowing or through EU grant funding. Some of these ports are also examining the business potential of ORE. At my request, officials have commenced an assessment of options for the facilitation of ORE by the ports, including possible funding under the European recovery and resilience facility. However, it was decided this would not be one of the projects going forward to Europe as part of Ireland's national recovery and resilience plan due to prioritisation of other more mature projects that are in line with EU timelines to maximise Ireland's overall funding. My Department is continuing to explore whether there is any other funding available to assist with the provision of ORE facilities at ports. In particular, officials are currently engaging with the European Commission seeking changes to the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE in the next funding stream for 2021-2023 and also in an effort to influence the next trans-European network for transport, TEN-T, regulation so that green infrastructure projects will be included.	spk_254
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Climate Change Policy	dbsect_17	I agree with what Deputy Murphy said about the importance of offshore renewable energy. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is present and I can attest to his passion and commitment to ensuring this is rolled out. Any funding provided to ports can only be a contribution towards the costs and would have to be in compliance with state aid rules. It is envisaged that this would require a competition and it would then be up to the ports to apply for any funding that might become available after preparation of a comprehensive business case. In this context, ports would have to engage directly with industry on specific requirements and investment costs. My Department is also meeting with other ports and administrations to establish best practice in this regard in Europe. We are looking at how other countries have done this. There is ongoing engagement between the Departments of Transport, the Environment, Climate and Communications and Housing, Local Government and Heritage.In addition, there is direct engagement with the offshore renewable energy sector and other relevant stakeholders to explore the mechanisms of investment required for this infrastructure.	spk_256
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Climate Change Policy	dbsect_17	I thank the Deputy. We have to identify funding streams, which is what the Department is actively doing. We are engaging with the European Commission to seek changes to the CEF criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for offshore renewable energy in the next 2021-2023 funding stream. We are also seeking to influence the next TEN-T regulations so that green infrastructure projects could be included in that. As a sea port on the comprehensive network, Rosslare is eligible to apply for European CEF funding for transport-related infrastructure. That work is ongoing in the Department to determine and identify funding streams. On competition, all ports are competing with one another. We would encourage ports to work together. Some boards have different strengths and abilities. They could put together a business case. It would be a competition and state aid rules would apply around that, but there is a lot of engagement taking place within the Department and with the industry because it is critical that we get the information from industry in respect of its needs and what it requires in order to roll this out successfully for Ireland.	spk_258

We must support our airports so that they are able to rebound as easily and quickly as possible when the time is right. We must also protect as many jobs as possible, not just in aviation but in every other sector that depends on it.	spk_246
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Driver Test	dbsect_20	The current public health emergency has had a profoundly disruptive effect on the learning and testing system in this country. I can assure the Deputy that the Department is very aware of the challenges facing the Road Safety Authority, RSA, as it works hard to manage the backlog in the driver testing and theory testing service. The driving test service is not currently operating as normal due to the impact of Covid-19. Tests are only available, under level 5 restrictions, to essential workers. This has had a significant impact on waiting times. RSA driver testers are undertaking driving tests in extraordinarily difficult conditions. The driving test is conducted in an enclosed space for a period of over 15 minutes, where physical distancing is not possible. Given the significant risk to testers when conducting a driving test, the Government has deemed that the driver testing service should be available only for essential workers in level 5 Covid-19 restrictions. Due to the suspension of driver testing services in the first 2020 lockdown, along with the health protocols since resumption of service and the further curtailing of services during subsequent level 5 restrictions, a significant backlog has developed. While the service is limited during level 5 restrictions, the RSA is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints with an eye to resuming wider testing after level 5. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog. Following discussions with the RSA, my Department has approved the hiring of a further 40 temporary testers for 22 months.The process of recruitment is now under way. However, it will take some time for people to be selected and trained. These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers which I previously gave sanction to rehire during 2020. The provision of extra testers will not on its own suffice to address the problem. One of the difficulties is with the capacity of test centres themselves, given limits on throughput due to Covid-19.	spk_248
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Driver Test	dbsect_20	My understanding is that testing capacity is at the maximum allowed under public health advice. There is a limit to the number of tests that can be physically carried out each day due to the level 5 restrictions. Even with the hire of extra driver testers, that in itself will not help the current backlog due to the time involved and the limitations on the throughput in the centres. I assure Deputy O'Rourke that we are in constant contact with the RSA, which is working very hard to come up with ways to reduce the backlog when the level 5 restrictions are lifted in order to carry out more tests per day. Overtime is being considered to allow tests to be carried out later in the evening and at weekends. A number of measures are under consideration, but while level 5 restrictions are in place we are curtailed for public health reasons. We are trying to keep everybody safe - the instructor and the learner as well.	spk_250
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Driver Test	dbsect_20	Deputy O'Rourke can be assured that whatever resources are needed in order to alleviate this backlog will be provided. I have sanctioned 40 extra testers and they should be in place by the end of June. Given the public health restrictions under level 5, there is a physical limit to the number of tests that can be undertaken. I assure the Deputy that if more testers are required then more will be sanctioned. We are in constant communication with the RSA on the matter. Public health is our primary concern. Every question the Deputy has raised relates to public health. I accept that it is very frustrating for people who are trying to progress with their driving lessons and to get their test but the reason for the backlog is due to Covid-19 and trying to protect people. The RSA and the testers have done a very good job on minimising the spread of the virus because of the protocols they have in place.	spk_252
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Ports Development	dbsect_21	The primary function of State ports is to facilitate maritime transport, which is the most important means of connecting Ireland to international markets, accounting for more than 90% of Ireland's international trade, in volume terms. At the same time, it is recognised that there is a pressing need for Ireland to have the port capacity in place to exploit the opportunities presented by offshore renewable energy, ORE, with the programme for Government targeting a capacity of 5 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, met with Iarnród Éireann on 1 December 2020 and it outlined the potential for Rosslare Port to service the emerging offshore wind sector in Ireland and the scale of the investment in infrastructure needed depending on a number of options. Rosslare is unique among the State-owned ports, as it is not a commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts but is instead operated on a commercial basis as a division of Iarnród Éireann with all investments funded from port revenues. This is similar to other ports in Ireland which receive no Exchequer funding and must fund all their infrastructure developments through their own resources, borrowing or through EU grant funding. Some of these ports are also examining the business potential of ORE. At my request, officials have commenced an assessment of options for the facilitation of ORE by the ports, including possible funding under the European recovery and resilience facility. However, it was decided this would not be one of the projects going forward to Europe as part of Ireland's national recovery and resilience plan due to prioritisation of other more mature projects that are in line with EU timelines to maximise Ireland's overall funding. My Department is continuing to explore whether there is any other funding available to assist with the provision of ORE facilities at ports. In particular, officials are currently engaging with the European Commission seeking changes to the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE in the next funding stream for 2021-2023 and also in an effort to influence the next trans-European network for transport, TEN-T, regulation so that green infrastructure projects will be included.	spk_254
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Ports Development	dbsect_21	I agree with what Deputy Murphy said about the importance of offshore renewable energy. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is present and I can attest to his passion and commitment to ensuring this is rolled out. Any funding provided to ports can only be a contribution towards the costs and would have to be in compliance with state aid rules. It is envisaged that this would require a competition and it would then be up to the ports to apply for any funding that might become available after preparation of a comprehensive business case. In this context, ports would have to engage directly with industry on specific requirements and investment costs. My Department is also meeting with other ports and administrations to establish best practice in this regard in Europe. We are looking at how other countries have done this. There is ongoing engagement between the Departments of Transport, the Environment, Climate and Communications and Housing, Local Government and Heritage.In addition, there is direct engagement with the offshore renewable energy sector and other relevant stakeholders to explore the mechanisms of investment required for this infrastructure.	spk_256
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-03-24	dail	33	Ports Development	dbsect_21	I thank the Deputy. We have to identify funding streams, which is what the Department is actively doing. We are engaging with the European Commission to seek changes to the CEF criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for offshore renewable energy in the next 2021-2023 funding stream. We are also seeking to influence the next TEN-T regulations so that green infrastructure projects could be included in that. As a sea port on the comprehensive network, Rosslare is eligible to apply for European CEF funding for transport-related infrastructure. That work is ongoing in the Department to determine and identify funding streams. On competition, all ports are competing with one another. We would encourage ports to work together. Some boards have different strengths and abilities. They could put together a business case. It would be a competition and state aid rules would apply around that, but there is a lot of engagement taking place within the Department and with the industry because it is critical that we get the information from industry in respect of its needs and what it requires in order to roll this out successfully for Ireland.	spk_258
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-02-10	dail	33	Covid-19 (Transport and Travel): Statements	dbsect_13	I will address the impact of Covid on the aviation, freight and maritime sectors in the context of the vital role they play in ensuring that our supply chains continue to operate effectively during the pandemic. The maritime sector has had to be agile and shipping and ports operations have had to respond, in one form or another, in order to maintain delivery of essential goods and mitigate the risk of the virus, ensuring that both workers and passengers were transported as safely as possible. I want to say how deeply appreciative I am of these efforts. The maritime sector is essential to the continued supply of goods and accounts for 90% of Ireland's international trade in volume terms. This sector is facing challenges, not least of which is the significant decline in passenger numbers. Passenger figures for 2020 showed a reduction of over 70% in comparison with 2019. Continuing travel restrictions have severely impacted on the combined freight and passenger services and leave questions over their viability. These restrictions have been necessary, however, in order to ensure the protection of everyone. I am hopeful that as we roll out the vaccination programme and case numbers begin to fall, we can once again look to align ourselves more closely with the EU position on a more co-ordinated approach to international travel. The haulage industry has also played a huge role in keeping flows of goods moving into and out of the country during the pandemic while also adapting to the huge changes to our supply chains arising from Brexit. The challenges to the sector have been compounded by the imposition of testing by some EU member states for some of our essential supply chain workers. A new French law came into force on 28 January requiring truck drivers arriving in France on direct ferries from Ireland to show a negative Covid test result. Following a rapid procurement process, my Department has contracted an Irish company, RocDoc Limited, to provide free tests for commercial drivers travelling to France. Three new test centres are now up and running and testing is also available at an existing facility at Cork Airport. This testing is separate to the public health Covid testing. The new arrangements are working well at both the Irish and French ends, but will be kept under close review. Ireland is still advocating that all EU member states should adhere to the EU green lanes recommendation that essential transport workers should be exempt from such tests in the interest of keeping essential supply chains running. Turning to aviation, as with maritime passenger traffic, international air passenger traffic has collapsed due to Covid-19 and the Irish aviation sector is currently experiencing its most challenging crisis, more severe than 9/11 or the global financial crash. Many analysts are predicting that it will take several years for the sector to return to 2019 levels. Traffic in 2020 was down 80% on 2019. Traffic levels at our three State airports are down between 90% and 97%. Dublin is down 90%, and Shannon and Cork are down 94% and 97%, respectively. The smaller airports have also been affected. No scheduled services will be operating at Shannon until April at the earliest. Knock, Kerry and Donegal have no scheduled international routes either, and Cork Airport has currently one airline serving one route on which there are only three flights a week. The sector will continue to face a range of challenges over the coming months and a protracted recovery is likely. Irish aviation will only begin to fully recover when there is some prospect of a sustainable return to international travel, including non-essential leisure travel. It is true to say that the maritime sector does the heavy lifting for Ireland as a global trading nation. It has proven resilient, competitive and robust throughout this and previous economic crises. It continues to provide an essential lifeline to our key markets and for the supply of essential goods into the country. That does not mean that this sustained pandemic has not severely impacted the sector. My Department provided for a financial intervention for the sector for a short period last year by way of the designation of five key strategic routes as public service obligation routes. Shipping operators are clear that their survival is not guaranteed should this pandemic and the associated impacts on international connectivity continue for a prolonged period. My officials continue to engage with the sector to determine the measures we can put in place which will ensure that the sector remains operational throughout this pandemic, particularly in light of the added challenges emerging since Brexit. My Department is also monitoring the enormous financial impact of Covid-19 on the Irish aviation sector on an ongoing basis, in consultation with all key stakeholders and relevant Departments. The Government has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including the aviation sector. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiver of commercial rates, tax clawback, the Covid restriction support scheme, the credit guarantee scheme, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, working capital scheme. In addition to these general business support measures, the Government has also agreed a revised €80 million funding package specifically for Irish aviation. Subject to state aid clearance, which is being worked on as a priority, this funding will be made available primarily to our airports through a number of schemes. Despite all of this, and my commitment to do more if it is needed, a protracted recovery is likely. Irish aviation will only begin to fully recover when there is some prospect of a sustainable return to international travel, including non-essential leisure travel. I wish to briefly address the impact of Covid on the delivery of essential transport services a bit closer to home. There have been a number of impacts on driver and road safety services provided to the public by my Department and the Road Safety Authority and arrangements have been put in place to assist those affected. Extensions to both driving licences and learner permits were put in place in 2020 and certificates of professional competence have also had their validity extended. Special measures have also been put in place regarding the renewal of driving licences for the over-70s. The National Driver Licence Service has expanded the online facility to accommodate all driving licence and learner permit applications to enable accessibility online rather than by calling to an office. At present, in level 5, driving tests are available only to those who are involved in essential services and significant backlogs have resulted from this. We are discussing how we can return to the normal target for the maximum waiting time, which is approximately ten weeks. It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications means that it will take time to reach a normal waiting time. The national car test and the commercial vehicle roadworthiness test inspection regimes are now classified as essential services and there is no suspension or interruption to either service at present. Staff in the Department and its agencies are working to ensure that the most negative impacts of Covid on the sector are managed, and mitigated. Transport remains one of the hardest hit sectors. The minister and I are working ceaselessly to ensure that the sector continues to meet the challenges facing it and delivers the essential connectivity, supply chain access and services that we all need.	spk_165

Many of the supports that the Government has implemented were raised by the aviation task force and the Oireachtas transport committee, which has done excellent work in this regard. The supports include the wage subsidy scheme, the alleviation of commercial rates, a tax clawback, the Covid restrictions support scheme, the credit guarantee scheme and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, working capital scheme. Many of these supports have been availed of throughout the aviation sector, including by airlines. It is estimated that more than €100 million in operational support has already been made available under these schemes to Irish airlines and airports. The Government has also revised a support package of €80 million specifically for Irish aviation. It is being worked on as a priority. That funding will primarily be made to our airports across the country.	spk_170
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-02-10	dail	33	Covid-19 (Transport and Travel): Statements	dbsect_13	I agree that it is very frustrating for people who want to get their driver tests. As a result of the suspension of the driver testing services during the first lockdown there has been a significant backlog. During level 5, driver tests are only available to those who are involved in essential services, including retail workers. We should bear in mind there is no magic bullet for this because no matter how many testers we have, the issue is around the health protocols which limit the throughput in centres and the number of driver tests that can be done every day. In December 2020, the Department approved the hire of a further 40 temporary testers for 22 months. They will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers who were rehired over 2020. The Road Safety Authority, RSA, will examine how the number of tests that can be performed every day can be increased, but of course we must make sure that we adhere to the health protocols around that. The RSA has also advised that it has established a dedicated web form so that essential workers can access a driver test. Anyone looking for an urgent driver test appointment who falls into that category can apply online through  There will be a backlog and delays. The RSA is hiring but it comes down to the numbers of people who can be put through the centre while ensuring that everyone is safe, both those working in the testing facilities and those getting their tests.	spk_191

It is a decision for the RSA with regard to essential workers. Without wanting to repeat myself, the RSA is hiring those 40 extra testers and more will be hired if needed. However, the real issue is the pandemic and the consequent need to restrict the numbers going through the centres. Sometimes it is not down to the number of driver testers but the capacity of throughput in a centre while keeping people safe and ensuring we suppress the virus.	spk_193
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-02-10	dail	33	Covid-19 (Transport and Travel): Statements	dbsect_13	I can answer one of the later questions first. There is ongoing engagement on the aviation sector between my Department and the airlines and at a high level in the Government. It is absolutely critical. I do not need to tell the Deputy or anybody in his region the importance of Ireland West Airport Knock to the region. When we come out of this pandemic, airports like Knock should be in a position to be able to rebound and get back their critical international connectivity not just for the west but Ireland as an island nation. As the Deputy mentioned, €21.3 million has recently been announced as part of the regional airports programme. As part of the announcement last year, the Government also allocated the supplementary support scheme for Irish airports, amounting to €26 million. That is subject to state aid approval but Knock Airport is one of the facilities that would be able to avail of it, which would help to address liquidity issues. The Deputy can be assured that it is of significant concern to me and the Government that all our airports can be in a position to come back and we can support them through this critical time, as he has stated.	spk_207
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-02-10	dail	33	Covid-19 (Transport and Travel): Statements	dbsect_13	I thank the Deputy for raising this question. I know there have been issues in relation to people contacting the Road Safety Authority. My Department has been in contact with the RSA. There were delays for people who contacted it and had to wait online. We have been assured by the RSA that those issues are being resolved. I will give an update on a number of other issues the Deputy raised. Driving licences that expired between 1 March and 31 August 2020 were extended for seven months and the possibility of further extension of driving licences is under consideration in Europe, with a decision expected shortly. On learner permits, they are a national competence and permits that expired between 1 March and 30 June 2020 were extended for eight months. In addition, learner permits that expired between 1 July and 31 October 2020 were extended by four months and the further extension of such permits is also under consideration. Drivers aged over 70 are being invited to renew their driver licence by post and applicants will be contacted directly in the case of anyone over 70 whose licence has expired. If there are issues, the Deputy can raise them with me separately and I will follow up on particular cases. Drivers aged over 70 do not need to provide a medical report unless they have an identified or specified illness. This means they do not to leave home to visit their general practitioner, provided they do not have a specified or identified illness, and can renew via An Post.	spk_225

Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-02-04	dail	33	Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_8	"I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" I thank the House for the opportunity today to introduce the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020. As we all know, I am bringing this Bill to the House at an incredibly difficult time for Irish aviation.Our airports, airlines, travel trade and tourism sectors have all suffered an unprecedented collapse in business as a result of Covid-19. Jobs have been lost and incomes decimated in a sector that delivered tremendous growth pre-Covid. I have met many people across the industry since coming into office, including employers, small businesses and staff representative bodies. I know that what they want most is a safe route back to trading. That is what we all want for them too and what my main focus will be this year. It will not be easy and at this moment especially it can be difficult to see past the imperative of minimising all but essential travel. However, Irish aviation is incredibly resilient. We have two of the most successful and financially robust airlines in Europe. We have an aviation leasing sector that is world leading and we have modern, high-performing airports. With continued Government support I am absolutely sure Irish aviation will recover quickly and rebuild the global connectivity that is so important for our economy. So far, Government support for the aviation industry is close to €200 million. It is estimated that more than €100 million in financial support has already been made available under the central schemes for Irish airlines and airports, including the wage subsidy scheme, the alleviation of commercial rates and others. In addition to these general business support measures, the Government has also agreed a revised €80 million funding package specifically for Irish aviation. As a start, the regional airports programme 2021 to 2025 has recently been launched, with a budget allocation of €21.3 million. It will be targeted at supporting our regional airports in Donegal, Knock and Kerry. A further €32 million is being provided through a new Covid-19 regional State airports programme for Cork and Shannon airports, with another €26 million being set aside to help address airport liquidity issues for Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Donegal, Knock and Kerry. While on the subject of supporting Irish aviation, I acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks, which committed much of its time last year to examining the plight of Irish aviation and making recommendations on how to help it back on its feet. The committee's report identified many of the key issues and contains sensible policy proposals which align closely with the Government's objectives. It reveals a broad political consensus about the importance of aviation and State supports and the need for a co-ordinated effort between industry and the Government in setting out a realistic and clear path for recovery. It is against this challenging background that I introduce the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020. This Bill looks to the future and seeks to put in place a modern regulatory system that will underpin Irish aviation for the next decade and more. An internationally competitive and sustainable aviation industry needs a strong and reputable regulatory regime, which is what this Bill provides. The current regime was put in place in the early 1990s, and although it has served the industry well over that time, the institutional structures no longer reflect international best practices. This Bill addresses that matter. The Bill has three main objectives. It will merge the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, with those of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR. In doing so, it establishes a single independent and strengthened aviation regulator. It establishes a new commercial semi-State company to manage Irish-controlled airspace. It also makes changes to how the airport charges are set at Dublin Airport by putting a greater emphasis on the needs and expectations of the consumer. For the most part, the Bill provides for the redesignation of existing regulatory and business functions. Aviation is a highly regulated industry and the Irish system is mostly formed from adherence to international conventions and agreements and EU law. Much of this Bill is concerned with ensuring these international obligations are properly assigned and the new institutional structures are robust. Taking each of the three objectives of the Bill in turn, I will first summarise the provisions of the merger of the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority and the Commission for Aviation Regulation. Currently, between them, these two State bodies are responsible for licensing airlines and individual aircraft; issuing airport operating licences, pilot licences and travel trade licences; inspecting compliance with aviation safety and security standards; setting airport charges at Dublin Airport; consumer rights under EU legislation protecting air passengers; and a range of other related tasks. The industry is required to engage with both entities and there is considerable overlap and interlinking with the engagement. This Bill will streamline the relationship, creating a one-stop regulatory shop, so to speak. The Commission for Aviation Regulation functions will be fully merged into the Irish Aviation Authority. The second objective of the Bill is to establish a new stand-alone commercial State company to provide air navigation services. This service is currently provided by the IAA, which has a dual regulatory and commercial function. This dual model was conceived in the 1990s and regulatory developments in international aviation since make it something of an outlier. It is simply not good practice to have a commercial and regulatory function in the same organisation, especially when part of the regulatory remit involves oversight of the commercial business. It is a self-regulation arrangement, which is not an idea that finds much support nowadays. Therefore, as we merge the commission's regulatory functions into the IAA, we will at the same time remove the commercial business and set it up in a wholly separate State company. Both of these steps - merging the regulatory functions of the IAA and CAR while establishing a new commercial State air navigation company - involve the reassignment of staff and the redistribution of assets and liabilities. The Bill provides a clear and fair legal structure for the transfer of functions, land, assets and staff. On the matter of staff in particular, employees will move with their current positions on no less favourable terms and conditions. This commitment is set out in the Bill and it means staff remuneration and pension entitlements will not be affected by the institutional changes. The vast majority of staff will not notice any material change in their day-to-day work. There will be only minimal changes with respect to office locations in and around Dublin city centre and this will be on an agreed basis. I am glad to say my Department, the IAA and the CAR have maintained an open and very constructive dialogue with staff and their representative bodies on the provisions of this Bill. I am advised there is broad support for the reforms and comfort with the provisions of the Bill on terms and conditions. The third objective of the Bill is to make changes to how airport charges are set at Dublin Airport. Under the Aviation Regulation Act 2001, the Commission for Aviation Regulation is responsible for setting the maximum price that Dublin Airport can charge airlines for use of its facilitates. It is a complex economic regulatory process but its purpose is to ensure that the price charged by Dublin Airport, which is ultimately paid for by airline customers, is fair and sufficient to cover the development and maintenance of the airport. In setting a maximum price, the regulator effectively frames the medium-term development plan of Dublin Airport. The proposed changes set out in the Bill are based on recommendations arising from an independent review of the current framework, a review which included extensive industry and public consultation. The changes do not alter the main thrust of the existing price-setting regime but rather make incremental improvements that have the effect of strengthening the role of the regulator for the benefit of consumers. This part of the Bill contains policy changes, whereas the provisions on the institutional changes to the IAA and the CAR are almost exclusively about moving around existing functions. For that reason, I will take time to introduce these proposed policy changes. First, the Bill provides for a change to the statutory objectives of the airport charges regulatory regime. Throughout the aforementioned independent review process, it became clear that the overarching objective for the regulator should be to protect the interests of consumers while maintaining high standards of safety and security. This idea is reflected in the Bill, which sets out that the primary statutory objective of price setting at Dublin Airport shall be ""to protect and promote the reasonable interests of current and prospective users of Dublin Airport"". That objective is set above all others. The Bill also for the first time requires the regulator to take account of Government policy on climate change when making a decision on the price and the medium-term development of Dublin Airport. There are a number of other noteworthy policy amendments and improvements.Currently, the Minister for Transport has the power to provide policy directions to the regulator, which must be considered when making a decision on airport charges. This power has been used by previous Ministers, but on reflection, it is difficult to square such a provision with the idea of strong, independent regulation. Therefore, it is proposed to remove it and instead provide that the regulator must have regard to current Government aviation policy. This will ensure that the regulator's periodic review of airport charges will be appropriately framed within the context of current Government policy, but without being subject to specific ministerial instructions which could cut across regulatory independence. Another change proposed in the Bill is to place a new obligation on the regulator to produce a statement of strategy every three years, setting out details and indicators of its performance. This is an additional level of accountability and transparency and is intended to dovetail with greater independence in decision-making. The Bill also introduces some additional flexibility into the regulatory process, by allowing the regulator to extend its current decision on the maximum airport charge price for up to two years. Currently, the regulator reviews and resets the maximum airport charge at Dublin Airport every five years. This will continue to be the norm, but the Bill allows for some flexibility around this, so long as all parties - the regulator, the airport and the airlines - agree that it is in the common interest to apply it. Changes are also proposed to the regulatory appeals process. Currently, where an appeal of a regulatory decision on airport charges is made, the Minister for Transport is required to appoint a panel of up to three experts to hear the appeal. That panel of experts has the power to revert the regulatory decision back to the regulator for reconsideration. However, during the review of the regime, concern was raised from all sides about this process. It was suggested that any ministerial involvement was inappropriate and that the process had no teeth, with the appeals panel having no ability to direct the regulator to make changes to the determination. Ultimately, it is recommended that the current process be abolished. That is what I am providing for. In its place, it is proposed that all parties may appeal a regulatory decision directly to the courts. While there would normally be concerns raised about pricing the ordinary person out of an appeals process by requiring them to engage professional legal expertise at possible great expense, all of the appeals lodged under the current process to date have been taken by either airlines or the airport authority. Indeed, I understand that it is the practice in the current appeal process to employ legal representation, although it is not required. The likelihood of a single individual taking an appeal on this matter is remote. Finally, to ensure that the airport charges regime continues to deliver on its proposed new objectives, there is a new provision for periodic reviews of regulatory policy. Such a review will consider the effectiveness of the current regime and will make recommendations for any changes. It will include stakeholder engagement and be cognisant of any changes to market conditions. Aviation is an ever-changing industry and it is critical to Ireland's economic interests. Therefore, it is important that we get the level of economic regulation right and so it is prudent to provide for future review of the regime to ensure that what we have is working. In conclusion, this Bill contains important institutional and regulatory reforms which, if enacted, will provide a regulatory framework more suited to the demands of 21st century aviation. We are currently operating under structures first envisaged almost 30 years ago. Time to refresh is overdue. I know the industry is in a very difficult place at the moment and I have no doubt that it has more pressing concerns than regulation. However, my focus has to be on more than just the immediate crisis. The Government agreed an €80 million financial package for Irish aviation before Christmas, which will be rolled out through various support schemes in the coming months. If more is needed to be done, it will be done. This Bill is looking to what we need post-crisis and it is seeking to put in place now the structures that will serve Irish aviation for the next decade and more. It strengthens independent regulatory oversight, it addresses institutional structures that are outdated and it makes changes to ensure that consumers are better served and that their rights and expectations are recognised and acted upon. I look forward to this debate on the Bill and to discussing it in more detail on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House."	spk_197
Hildegarde Naughton	50	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2021-02-04	dail	33	Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_10	I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the Second Stage debate. I will endeavour to answer as many questions as I can. I will certainly address any remaining matters on Committee Stage. I welcome the support of Deputies for the Bill. I will come back to Deputy O'Rourke and some of his questions seeking further information on matters such as costs. They will be kept to a minimum and it is something on which the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, board and senior management are focused. There has been regular engagement between my Department and Fórsa, the main staff union for the IAA and the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, as well as between the company and the staff representatives. The Bill is quite clear that staff terms and conditions will not be affected by any institutional changes. As I alluded to in my introductory remarks, this important legislation brings together a number of different strands of policy into a single comprehensive Bill to create an independent and strengthened aviation regulator. The recovery to an internationally competitive and sustainable aviation industry needs a strong and reputable regulatory regime. The proposed institutional reforms contained in the Bill will create a single national aviation regulator responsible for safety, security and economic regulation. In order to do this, the regulatory functions of the IAA and the CAR will be combined. The Bill will also separate the for-profit air traffic control services functions of the IAA and place them in a newly formed commercial semi-State company, which will be called the Irish air navigation service. One of the most important consequences of the Bill is that it will bring to an end to the dual commercial and regulator role of the IAA. I can finish there if the Ceann Comhairle so wishes.	spk_215

I am advised by NBI that as of 26 January 2021, more than 166,000 premises in 26 counties had been surveyed, which is ahead of schedule. The next step for NBI is to develop network designs to deliver the new fibre-to-the-home network to these premises and substantial design work is under way. More than 13,000 premises have been surveyed to date in Carrigaline and Midleton and network designs completed. NBI crews have started initial works for the build in the more than 4,500 premises in the Carrigaline area, including Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon and Kilpatrick, while surveys have started in Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Umeraboy, Knocknagree, Rineen, Cullen, Coolinarna, Millstreet, Hollymount and Caherbarnagh.

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-12-16	dail	33	Proposal re Agreement with Danish State on Statistical Transfer of Energy from Renewable Sources: Motion	dbsect_2	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Agreement between Ireland and the Danish State on the establishment of a framework for the statistical transfer of energy from renewable sources for target compliance purposes under Directive 2009/28/EC, signed and done at Dublin on 1st December, 2020, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 4th December, 2020.I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this important matter. Under the 2009 renewable energy directive, we are committed to achieving 16% of our energy demand from renewable resources by the end of 2020. Notwithstanding the good progress that has been achieved, especially in renewable electricity, projections by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, indicate that a shortfall of between 3% and 4% is likely by year end. In order to ensure compliance with the directive, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has negotiated international agreements with Estonia and Denmark to purchase statistical transfers for 2020. Following Government approval in late November, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, signed both agreements in Dublin earlier this month. They will enter into force, subject to ratification by the Dáil Éireann. This mechanism is part of the European architecture under the 2009 renewable energy directive designed to allow member states to meet their targets. While it was not our preference to achieve compliance via this mechanism, we have, unfortunately, exhausted all alternative options for compliance through other policies and measures. Ireland is not alone among member states which will fall short of its binding renewable energy targets. Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands have all concluded similar arrangements in recent years. As to costs, the State will pay €37.5 million to Estonia for the purchase of 2.5 TW hours of energy and €12.5 million to Denmark for a volume of 1 TW hour of energy. In total, the State will procure 3.5 TW hours of renewable energy at a cost of €50 million this year. While the Government acknowledges that this is a significant cost to the State, it is nevertheless important to point out that the funds received by both Estonia and Denmark will be used to accelerate deployment of renewable electricity in their jurisdictions, in line with their national energy and climate plans. Both of the agreements are with EU member states with which Ireland shares a common commitment to taking robust climate action in accelerating the roll-out of renewable energy to supply our grid, heat our homes and move our people as part of an integrated transport network. Like Ireland, Denmark and Estonia are small countries with a strong European identity and these agreements will strengthen future co-operation between Ireland and its fellow EU member states to tackle the climate emergency and put citizens at the heart of the climate transition.  Since coming into office in June, this Government has overseen the first auction under the transformational renewable electricity support scheme. This will see a major upscaling in renewable energy projects connecting to the grid from 2021, with, for the first time, solar energy and community-owned projects supplying homes across Ireland. The programme for Government provides that a reliable supply of safe, secure and clean energy is essential to deliver a phase-out of fossil fuels. The Government is committed to rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector and will take the necessary action to deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030. The climate action plan included a commitment to 3.5 GW of offshore wind by 2030, up to 8.2 GW of onshore wind and up to 1.5 GW of solar energy. The programme for Government commits to a further increase in offshore wind development to 5 GW by 2030.  On sustainable transport, the climate plan has a target of 936,000 electric vehicles to be on the road in Ireland by 2030 and also includes a range of actions to support the uptake of electric vehicles.  I welcome the launch by the European Commission last week of the sustainable and smart mobility strategy, which lays the foundation for how the EU transport system can achieve its green and digital transformation. To give a flavour of some of the ambitious actions contained in the strategy, by 2030 at least 30 million zero-emission cars will be in operation on European roads, 100 European cities will be climate-neutral, high-speed rail traffic will double across Europe, automated mobility will be deployed at a large scale, and zero-emission marine vessels will be market-ready.  It is important for Ireland to demonstrate its commitment to meeting renewable energy targets and sustainable transport commitments in support of the wider aspirations of the European Green Deal. The forthcoming climate action plan next year will further step up our ambitions with the necessary actions to ensure the cross-government effort that is required is being implemented and monitored effectively. I look forward to hearing the contributions from Members on this important issue and I thank the House.	spk_1
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-12-16	dail	33	Proposal re Agreement with Danish State on Statistical Transfer of Energy from Renewable Sources: Motion	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputies for their contributions, specifically the members of the Select Committee on Climate Action who gave priority consideration to these agreements at their meeting yesterday afternoon. A number of Deputies have rightly remarked on the significant costs to the State associated with these agreements and what an equivalent investment of €50 million would have achieved in retrofitting our housing stock, or in education or public health. The solution to avoiding future costs for statistical transfers or other such measures is not to reduce our climate and energy ambitions, it is to accelerate delivery across all Departments and State agencies concerned. The Government's Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill will establish a 2050 climate neutrality objective in law and place all relevant climate plans and strategies on a statutory footing. The Bill will define how five-year carbon budgets and related sectoral targets will be set, with every sector contributing, ensuring that we continue to work to achieve a broad political and societal consensus on the transition to a climate-neutral economy and society. Putting these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this Government and future Governments to take sustained climate action. The Bill also provides appropriate oversight by Government, a strengthened climate change advisory council and a significantly strengthened accountability and oversight role for the Oireachtas. A number of Deputies commented on the enormous opportunity from offshore renewable energy. To progress our commitment of having 5 GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030, the Department is developing the terms and conditions of the offshore renewable electricity support scheme, RESS. The offshore RESS will be the means for supporting offshore wind developments via a competitive, auction-based framework. The competitive element is required under the state aid clearance for the scheme in order to achieve our renewable energy ambitions at the lowest cost to consumers. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will shortly be publishing a public consultation on microgeneration. It will seek stakeholder views on a microgeneration support scheme which will, in time, provide an export tariff for excess electricity produced by homes and businesses. The proposed scheme will be aligned with the requirements of the recast renewable energy directive 2018 which has to be transposed by June 2021. The scheme will offer homes, businesses and farms an opportunity to earn some money for excess electricity produced. However, it is important that people first reduce their energy demand through energy efficiency measures, such as retrofitting and measures like it. The Government is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and an annual reduction of 7% in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, including through maximising the amount of renewable energy on the grid. Future advances and system flexibility, storage technologies, including batteries and green hydrogen, as well as regional and international interconnection, will enable high levels of renewable electricity on our grid.	spk_8

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-12-15	dail	33	Regional Airports	dbsect_34	I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to speak about Sligo Airport. As she will be aware, Sligo Airport is a private company based in Strandhill. As well as general aviation services, the airport operates as a Coast Guard search and rescue base under a commercial contract with CHC Ireland. The Department of Transport contracts for the delivery of the search and rescue service to CHC Ireland, which uses Sligo Airport as a base to deliver part of this service. The arrangements for this are a matter between CHC and Sligo Airport and do not involve the Department of Transport. As such, the airport does not receive funding from the Department in respect of the search and rescue service. It has been almost a decade since Sligo Airport was eligible for Exchequer funding. Before 2011, when the airport operated scheduled services, it received State support through the Government's regional airports programme and a PSO air service between Sligo and Dublin. Policy on regional airports has always been focused on optimising conditions for connectivity. As a result, Exchequer funding is contingent on airports operating scheduled passenger services as part of that programme. In the past, in the absence of high-quality road and rail infrastructure and services, Ireland's smallest airports had a more pronounced role in national connectivity. However, following the substantial development of the national road network, particularly the completion of the interurban motorways from 2009 onwards, Government policy on supporting regional airports has become more focused on facilitating international access to the regions. In light of this and the need to maximise scarce resources following the financial crisis of 2008, the Department completed a value-for-money review on supports for regional airports in 2010. The review made certain recommendations in respect of these supports, which were duly incorporated into the design of subsequent regional airport programmes. The main outcome of the review was the withdrawal of funding for PSO services between Dublin and the airports at Galway and Sligo. As a result, Sligo Airport no longer met the criteria for inclusion in the programme and all Exchequer funding to the airport ceased after 2011. Without passenger flights or plans to develop passenger flights, Sligo Airport's operations still fail to meet the connectivity objective associated with Government policy on funding of regional airports. I expect to publish a new regional airports programme for the period 2021 to 2025 in the coming weeks and Government has provided €21.3 million for this programme in budget 2021. The new programme will focus Exchequer funding on our smaller regional airports with scheduled passenger air services and annual passengers of less than 1 million passengers. This programme will help eligible airports remain viable as they begin to plan for recovery and transition away from the devastation of Covid-19. The programme will also support the PSO air services between Kerry and Dublin, and Donegal and Dublin. As policy will continue to target support at regional airports that can facilitate international connectivity, Sligo Airport will remain ineligible for funding under the new programme.	spk_316

The Government fully recognises and acknowledges the contribution Sligo Airport makes to the search and rescue service. However, CHC Ireland, as the operator, is fully responsible for agreeing operational arrangements with all the airports involved in the delivery of the search and rescue service, including Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo. In that context, neither the Department nor the Coast Guard have contractual arrangements with the airports concerned. CHC Ireland uses the facilities provided by Sligo Airport to provide part of the service, and the arrangements in that regard are a matter for CHC Ireland and the airport. That aside, I advise that the Coast Guard, having been made aware of the potential challenges facing Sligo Airport, has requested CHC Ireland to monitor the situation and to alert it if the evolving situation creates issues for service delivery. I also assure the Deputy that the Coast Guard will continue to assess the situation in conjunction with CHC Ireland and I will consider matters again if the situation changes.

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-12-08	dail	33	Driver Test	dbsect_34	I thank the Deputies for raising the matter in regard to access to hygiene and health facilities for approved driving instructors at driver test centres. Both the Department of Transport and the Road Safety Authority are aware that driving instructors disagree with the decision by the RSA to close washing facilities and waiting rooms in driver test centres to ensure compliance with public and occupational health requirements during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. I understand from the Road Safety Authority that prior to the current pandemic, some test centres across the country offered toilet facilities and, in some cases, indoor waiting rooms where instructors could choose to wait while their students were out undergoing their test. To be clear, some test centres around the country do not and have never had large waiting rooms or toilet facilities available for instructors. As the Deputies are aware, driver testing is continuing under the current level 3 restrictions. The Road Safety Authority has been presented with the challenge of facilitating tests while at the same time safeguarding the safety of its staff and the public, minimising the risk of spreading the virus.The safety of staff and test candidates is of paramount importance and this is highlighted by the range of steps taken to prevent virus transmission in the driver testing service. Some 60,000 tests have been conducted since tests resumed and no known case of virus transmission has been reported. I understand that, at present, toilet facilities at test centres are only available to the learner driver who is undertaking his or her driving test. There are no waiting area facilities available in any of the test centres for either the learner or the instructor. The learner is contacted by phone while he or she is outside the centre and is then invited inside by the driver tester where the identity of the learner driver is established and preliminary test questions are concluded. Following this, the practical examination takes place. The test concludes back in the testing centre where the driver tester delivers the results and provides feedback to the candidate. The case being made by the approved driving instructors is that they should have access to public areas of the test centre. This would have the effect of introducing third parties into the test centre without the robust controls in place for test candidates being undertaken. Twenty of the current 53 driving test centres are in shared premises over which the RSA does not control right of access. There are other instances where the RSA controls access, such as the Finglas test centre. This is one of the largest test centres, and up to 14 driver testers work there daily. There is no service officer on duty to control access to the centre so if access were to be granted to approved driving instructors and accompanying drivers, any member of the public would be able to walk in, thus breaching the public safety measures in place. In this House on 12 November, I made a commitment that I would contact the RSA on this matter. I can now confirm that I have received a comprehensive reply from the authority, outlining the absolute necessity of retaining these safety measures. The decision to temporarily close public toilet and waiting facilities, where previously available, has been taken by the RSA in the interests of public safety and as part of its overall Covid-19 resumption of service protocols and in line with health and safety risk assessment procedures which had to be adopted as part of the RSA's resumption plans. It took account of guidance issued by the Health and Safety Authority and the return to work safely protocol agreed by the Labour and Employer Economic Forum, LEEF. I assure the Deputies that this is not a decision that has been taken lightly. I am sure that they will agree that the health and safety of workers, such as those in driving test centres, should be our priority. The RSA is committed to ensuring that once the levels of risk are diminished to the extent that would allow ADIs and others to access test centres, this will be facilitated. The situation is continually monitored by the RSA and reviewed subject to any change to current Government guidance.	spk_334
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-12-08	dail	33	Driver Test	dbsect_34	I thank the Deputies and acknowledge that this is a difficult situation. Covid-19 has been disruptive to a number of settings. This is an operational matter for the RSA and driving instructors operate as independent businesses. They are not employed by either the Department of Transport or the Road Safety Authority. Driver testers are direct employees of the Road Safety Authority and, like any employer, the Road Safety Authority has a duty of care to those employees.

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-12-08	dail	33	Driver Test	dbsect_38	I thank the Deputies for raising the matter in regard to access to hygiene and health facilities for approved driving instructors at driver test centres. Both the Department of Transport and the Road Safety Authority are aware that driving instructors disagree with the decision by the RSA to close washing facilities and waiting rooms in driver test centres to ensure compliance with public and occupational health requirements during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. I understand from the Road Safety Authority that prior to the current pandemic, some test centres across the country offered toilet facilities and, in some cases, indoor waiting rooms where instructors could choose to wait while their students were out undergoing their test. To be clear, some test centres around the country do not and have never had large waiting rooms or toilet facilities available for instructors. As the Deputies are aware, driver testing is continuing under the current level 3 restrictions. The Road Safety Authority has been presented with the challenge of facilitating tests while at the same time safeguarding the safety of its staff and the public, minimising the risk of spreading the virus.The safety of staff and test candidates is of paramount importance and this is highlighted by the range of steps taken to prevent virus transmission in the driver testing service. Some 60,000 tests have been conducted since tests resumed and no known case of virus transmission has been reported. I understand that, at present, toilet facilities at test centres are only available to the learner driver who is undertaking his or her driving test. There are no waiting area facilities available in any of the test centres for either the learner or the instructor. The learner is contacted by phone while he or she is outside the centre and is then invited inside by the driver tester where the identity of the learner driver is established and preliminary test questions are concluded. Following this, the practical examination takes place. The test concludes back in the testing centre where the driver tester delivers the results and provides feedback to the candidate. The case being made by the approved driving instructors is that they should have access to public areas of the test centre. This would have the effect of introducing third parties into the test centre without the robust controls in place for test candidates being undertaken. Twenty of the current 53 driving test centres are in shared premises over which the RSA does not control right of access. There are other instances where the RSA controls access, such as the Finglas test centre. This is one of the largest test centres, and up to 14 driver testers work there daily. There is no service officer on duty to control access to the centre so if access were to be granted to approved driving instructors and accompanying drivers, any member of the public would be able to walk in, thus breaching the public safety measures in place. In this House on 12 November, I made a commitment that I would contact the RSA on this matter. I can now confirm that I have received a comprehensive reply from the authority, outlining the absolute necessity of retaining these safety measures. The decision to temporarily close public toilet and waiting facilities, where previously available, has been taken by the RSA in the interests of public safety and as part of its overall Covid-19 resumption of service protocols and in line with health and safety risk assessment procedures which had to be adopted as part of the RSA's resumption plans. It took account of guidance issued by the Health and Safety Authority and the return to work safely protocol agreed by the Labour and Employer Economic Forum, LEEF. I assure the Deputies that this is not a decision that has been taken lightly. I am sure that they will agree that the health and safety of workers, such as those in driving test centres, should be our priority. The RSA is committed to ensuring that once the levels of risk are diminished to the extent that would allow ADIs and others to access test centres, this will be facilitated. The situation is continually monitored by the RSA and reviewed subject to any change to current Government guidance.	spk_334

Covid-19 has been disruptive to a number of settings. This is an operational matter for the RSA and driving instructors operate as independent businesses. They are not employed by either the Department of Transport or the Road Safety Authority. Driver testers are direct employees of the Road Safety Authority and, like any employer, the Road Safety Authority has a duty of care to those employees. That is why it has had to develop protocols to allow testers to carry out their job in as safe a manner as possible.

EU legislation sets out several requirements that must be satisfied in order to be eligible to hold a road transport operator licence, one of which is professional competence. In order to fulfil this requirement, every road transport undertaking in Ireland or, indeed, any other EU member state must have a nominated transport manager to effectively and continuously manage its transport activities. The transport manager must hold a certificate of professional competence in either road haulage or road passenger transport, depending on the nature of the operator's business. This certificate must be issued by an EU member state and is ordinarily obtained by passing a written examination. As highlighted by the European Commission in 2018 and, more recently, in July of this year, after the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, transport managers' CPCs issued by an authority of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, or a body authorised by the United Kingdom will no longer be valid in the EU. As part of the Government's Brexit preparations, the Department of Transport carried out a review and identified approximately 200 individuals with a UK-issued transport manager CPC who are currently nominated as transport manager for Irish road transport operators. The Department recently wrote to these transport managers and the relevant operators to ensure they are aware of the position as outlined by the European Commission. There are steps that affected transport managers and operators can take to ensure they continue to be in compliance with the relevant EU legislation. Individuals who hold a UK-issued transport manager CPC and who wish to act, after the end of the Brexit transition period, as transport manager for a road transport operator based in the EU, including Ireland, will need to obtain a transport manager CPC issued by an EU member state. This affects UK-qualified transport managers working for Irish operators, but also those working for other operators based in other EU member states. As outlined in the Department’s correspondence to those UK transport manager CPC holders who work as transport manager for Irish-based transport operators, the Department has communicated with the European Commission on this important issue. I am pleased to inform the House that the Commission yesterday evening indicated that before the end of the Brexit transition period we may issue a corresponding Irish transport manager CPC to those UK-qualified individuals working for Irish operators. This is extremely welcome news for those affected transport managers and operators as it means that the transport managers will not now be required to undertake an Irish exam in order to continue to work as transport manager for an Irish operator. In light of this clarification received from the European Commission, my Department is now examining as a matter of urgency the arrangements that must be put in place in order to allow for the issuing of corresponding transport manager CPCs to affected individuals. A further communication will shortly be issued to affected transport managers and operators to inform them of this recent update from the European Commission and to outline what needs to be done in order to obtain an Irish transport manager CPC. We will advise impacted transport managers to apply before the end of the year to avail of these new arrangements, and will communicate this as soon as possible. It is important to note that those affected will not need to sit an exam to secure an Irish CPC.	spk_375

In light of this, any testing for international travel will need to draw on resources from the private sector, which are not being accessed by the HSE. The testing regime envisaged under the Government decision for international travel will be implemented through the private supply of testing availability in Ireland. This will include: testing post arrival, from day five, for passengers from EU orange or red list locations; and testing for departing passengers who need or wish to complete a pre-departure test requirement before travelling to another country. Subject to the ongoing review of testing by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and the Government, a Covid-19 PCR test is currently the only test that is accepted for the purposes of allowing the advice relating to restricted movement to be waived. Testing technology and delivery options for facilitating international travel will be kept under review, including loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP, and antigen testing. Shannon and Cork airports have indicated that drive-through testing will be available today for passengers and the public. The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has indicated that the provision of testing at Dublin Airport by private providers can be increased within weeks. Testing at Dublin Airport will be undertaken by two providers by means of a drive-through facility and a walk-through facility at the airport. The DAA has advised that the testing offer by the providers will be reasonably priced, within what is generally available on the market. As there can be no certainty that capacity will be available to meet all possible requirements, intending passengers who wish to avail of testing should seek an appointment before travelling.	spk_2

We are at level 5. We have aligned ourselves with the EU traffic-light approach. People who come to this country from a red-list country will be asked to restrict their movements for 14 days. After five days, they can avail of PCR tests here. Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports and the private sector will be rolling out testing facilities. Travellers coming from orange list countries will be asked to take a test three days in advance of travelling. If they do not do that, they can also avail of the test here within five days, as per red list passengers. Again, it is about people taking personal responsibility when they come here and adhering to the local public health advice. Regarding some of the expected volumes, the DAA testing plan across Dublin and Cork airports has estimated the volume to be approximately 150 tests per day, ramping up to a total of 300 tests per day towards the end of the year. The DAA has also identified capacity in the private sector testing market of up to 12,000 PCR tests per day.	spk_4

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-11-12	dail	33	Trade Strategy	dbsect_3	Covid-19 has created difficulties for many public services, including the National Driver Licensing Service, NDLS and the driver testing service, which are provided by the Road Safety Authority. Closures during the initial lockdown earlier this year led inevitably to backlogs, while restrictions on the services, which are necessary in the interests of public health, have reduced capacity since the services reopened. The urgent health necessity which led to level 5 restrictions in October will have a further impact. This cannot be avoided, and no one will question that we must put public safety first.  In the case of the NDLS, all appointments must be booked in advance and the RSA is working with its providers to see how they can create additional capacity by making more evening and weekend hours available, the recruitment of additional staff, extending its postal service for those who are over 70 years, and expanding the online system from 9 November. The introduction of these steps will help ease some of the pressure, free up appointment slots and make it easier to apply online or find slots at local centres.  Driver testing always presented the greatest difficulties when operating under Covid-19 restrictions. Backlogs and waiting times will be addressed ultimately by increased capacity.My Department recently approved the retention of 18 temporary driver testers whose contracts were due to expire in October and November, and the rehiring of another 18 testers whose contracts expired in May. In addition, my Department is in discussion with the RSA, on putting a more comprehensive plan in place to address the backlog. While discussions are well-advanced, there are no quick fixes, and the RSA estimates that it will be end of next year before we are back to the long-standing target of a ten-week wait period. I am aware that some driving instructors have expressed dissatisfaction that they are currently not permitted to enter the test centres. Currently only people who absolutely need to enter a test centre can do so to minimise the risk. While this is an operational matter for the RSA, it is a decision the authority has taken in the interests of public health and safety, and not least that of the instructors, as well as those undergoing the tests, and the staff.	spk_14
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-11-12	dail	33	Trade Strategy	dbsect_3	The RSA is working to expand that capacity. The authority is working with its providers to see how it can do just exactly what the Deputy has outlined in regarding to extending weekend hours, overtime, the recruitment of additional staff as well as extending the postal service. It will need that extra capacity in terms of resources, but, at the same time, the throughput at the testing centres must be managed at all times. Many of the centres are small spaces, so that also needs to be managed in relation to the waiting areas. To give an idea of where we have come from, pre-Covid the waiting period was six and a half weeks whereas at the moment an applicant can expect to wait between 25 and 30 weeks. It is a very difficult situation, but we are trying to prioritise essential workers at the moment, and there is an email address to which essential workers can write, namely, urgentdrivingtest@rsa.ie.	spk_16

They are trying to minimise the throughput and the interaction at test centres, but I will speak to the RSA to see if further measures can be implemented.

Since the publication of the report, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to the Continent under close review, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The IMDO recently reviewed the conclusions and recommendations in the 2018 study and the issue of direct maritime connectivity and capacity to continental Europe at the end of the transition period. The IMDO analysis shows there is more than sufficient capacity on existing direct services in the roll-on, roll off - ro-ro - network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for all of the land bridge traffic, which is currently estimated at approximately 150,000 trucks per annum. It is also considered that the shipping industry is resilient, responsive and capable, without State intervention, of adjusting to and satisfying market demand. My Department has had very regular discussions with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders about this issue since January 2019. We have consistently received strong assurances from the shipping companies that if there is an increase in demand for shipping capacity on direct routes to continental Europe, they will respond. Significant additional shipping links have been added on direct routes to the Continent, even during the Covid-19 pandemic in summer 2020, with further improvements and increases in capacity announced to take place from January next. Indeed, in the past week, we have seen moves from Irish Ferries and Stena Line to change and increase their direct sailings to Cherbourg from January. Those changes mean that, between them, there will be a daily service from Ireland to France, resulting in a further increase in capacity on that direct continental Europe route.
               The Minister and I met with the shipping companies regarding maritime connectivity in mid-July of this year. I met with them again recently to discuss this issue further. The companies confirmed the reassurance already given regarding their ability to respond to demand as needed. This engagement is in addition to the fortnightly meetings which take place between officials in my Department and the shipping companies as well as separately with haulage representatives. My Department has also had confidential briefings with individual shipping companies in which they have outlined a range of options they can implement quickly from January, if required. The Government considers that direct State intervention to establish State shipping links in the context of Brexit would likely undermine a market response and result in an insufficient, inadequate and costly intervention being put in place. Such an intervention would be likely to result in legal challenges from incumbent shipping providers, breaches of EU state aid rules and consequent requirements for repayment of the state aids with interest, with resulting adverse impacts on the viability of any companies receiving such aid. It could also create difficulties for the State in extricating itself from the shipping market. A communications campaign is currently under way, ACT Now and Prepare to Switch, which encourages importers and exporters to focus immediately on the direct route option. The campaign encourages stakeholders to assess their current routes to market, communicate their future needs clearly to shipping companies and trial alternative services in order that disruption to the British land bridge route does not preclude Irish businesses from accessing foreign markets. My Department will continue to closely monitor and review the evolving situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports. We will remain in close consultation with the maritime sector and other relevant stakeholders on this issue."	spk_28

As recently as last week, Stena Line and Irish Ferries both indicated that they will be putting on a daily direct service from January. Indeed, they have been responding to demand throughout the pandemic and they put on extra services during the summer. The Minister and I met with representatives of the shipping companies last July and I met with them again last week. My officials have had fortnightly meetings with all stakeholders in the maritime sector and we have been assured that they will respond to demand.

The authority is working with its providers to see how it can do just exactly what the Deputy has outlined in regarding to extending weekend hours, overtime, the recruitment of additional staff as well as extending the postal service. It will need that extra capacity in terms of resources, but, at the same time, the throughput at the testing centres must be managed at all times. Many of the centres are small spaces, so that also needs to be managed in relation to the waiting areas. To give an idea of where we have come from, pre-Covid the waiting period was six and a half weeks whereas at the moment an applicant can expect to wait between 25 and 30 weeks. It is a very difficult situation, but we are trying to prioritise essential workers at the moment, and there is an email address to which essential workers can write, namely, urgentdrivingtest@rsa.ie.	spk_16

I know that in normal times, not just driving instructors, but somebody accompanying the learner driver doing their test, would normally be facilitated to wait in the waiting room in the driving test centres. However, these are not normal times. I take on board the Deputy's concerns in this regard. They are trying to minimise the throughput and the interaction at test centres, but I will speak to the RSA to see if further measures can be implemented. We are trying to adhere to public health guidelines and keep the testers, the learner drivers doing their tests and the staff within the centres, safe, and that also includes those who are accompanying the learner drivers.	spk_18

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-11-12	dail	33	Trade Strategy	dbsect_8	"As signalled since the publication of the report, The Implications of Brexit on the Use of the Landbridge, by the Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, in 2018, it has been a matter of continuing concern that there is likely to be disruption to access to the British land bridge when customs and border controls between the EU and the UK are introduced at the end of the year. Since the publication of the report, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to the Continent under close review, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The IMDO recently reviewed the conclusions and recommendations in the 2018 study and the issue of direct maritime connectivity and capacity to continental Europe at the end of the transition period. The IMDO analysis shows there is more than sufficient capacity on existing direct services in the roll-on, roll off - ro-ro - network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for all of the land bridge traffic, which is currently estimated at approximately 150,000 trucks per annum. It is also considered that the shipping industry is resilient, responsive and capable, without State intervention, of adjusting to and satisfying market demand. My Department has had very regular discussions with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders about this issue since January 2019. We have consistently received strong assurances from the shipping companies that if there is an increase in demand for shipping capacity on direct routes to continental Europe, they will respond. Significant additional shipping links have been added on direct routes to the Continent, even during the Covid-19 pandemic in summer 2020, with further improvements and increases in capacity announced to take place from January next. Indeed, in the past week, we have seen moves from Irish Ferries and Stena Line to change and increase their direct sailings to Cherbourg from January. Those changes mean that, between them, there will be a daily service from Ireland to France, resulting in a further increase in capacity on that direct continental Europe route.
               The Minister and I met with the shipping companies regarding maritime connectivity in mid-July of this year. I met with them again recently to discuss this issue further. The companies confirmed the reassurance already given regarding their ability to respond to demand as needed. This engagement is in addition to the fortnightly meetings which take place between officials in my Department and the shipping companies as well as separately with haulage representatives. My Department has also had confidential briefings with individual shipping companies in which they have outlined a range of options they can implement quickly from January, if required. The Government considers that direct State intervention to establish State shipping links in the context of Brexit would likely undermine a market response and result in an insufficient, inadequate and costly intervention being put in place. Such an intervention would be likely to result in legal challenges from incumbent shipping providers, breaches of EU state aid rules and consequent requirements for repayment of the state aids with interest, with resulting adverse impacts on the viability of any companies receiving such aid. It could also create difficulties for the State in extricating itself from the shipping market. A communications campaign is currently under way, ACT Now and Prepare to Switch, which encourages importers and exporters to focus immediately on the direct route option. The campaign encourages stakeholders to assess their current routes to market, communicate their future needs clearly to shipping companies and trial alternative services in order that disruption to the British land bridge route does not preclude Irish businesses from accessing foreign markets. My Department will continue to closely monitor and review the evolving situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports. We will remain in close consultation with the maritime sector and other relevant stakeholders on this issue."	spk_28
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-11-12	dail	33	Trade Strategy	dbsect_8	In regard to the IMDO report, it is important to note that its analysis took account of the capacity across the ro-ro network and on services between Ireland and continental Europe. As recently as last week, Stena Line and Irish Ferries both indicated that they will be putting on a daily direct service from January. Indeed, they have been responding to demand throughout the pandemic and they put on extra services during the summer. The Minister and I met with representatives of the shipping companies last July and I met with them again last week. My officials have had fortnightly meetings with all stakeholders in the maritime sector and we have been assured that they will respond to demand. The ACT Now and Prepare to Switch campaign is not just a call on the hauliers but also on importers and exporters to engage directly with shipping companies in regard to their needs.	spk_30
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-11-12	dail	33	Trade Strategy	dbsect_8	As we move towards the end of the Brexit transition period, there is a lot of engagement happening at a cross-departmental level, incorporating Dublin Port, the Office of Public Works, Revenue and my Department, to ensure we are as well prepared as possible. A huge amount of work has gone into this over the past number of years. There have been many campaigns aimed at preparing businesses, including hauliers, for customs checks. I thank the haulage industry representatives for their ongoing engagement with my Department. We know that the situation from 1 January will not be easy and there will be delays at the UK land bridge. That is why our ACT Now and Prepare to Switch campaign is asking importers and exporters to assess their needs in respect of the direct routes to the Continent, communicate with the shipping industry and trial alternative routes in advance of 1 January. I have been engaging as well with the Minister of State with responsibility for trade, Deputy Troy, in calling for businesses to prepare in the two months remaining before the start of the new year.	spk_32
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-11-12	dail	33	Rural Transport Services	dbsect_9	Foot passengers are currently able to travel to France on ferry services, with the exception of one operator over the winter months due to operational constraints. I understand that the Deputy's question was prompted by the announcement last Thursday regarding increased service frequencies on roll-on roll-off passenger, RoPax, ferry services from Ireland to France from January 2021 and by the publication of the Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, report regarding capacity on continental services. With the Brexit transition period coming to an end on 31 December and the resultant delays that are expected on the UK land bridge, I welcomed the IMDO report which found that there was more than sufficient spare capacity to accommodate any displaced land bridge traffic on direct routes to the continent. I also welcome the decision by both Irish Ferries and Stena Line to increase the frequency of their services to France in January 2021, providing more capacity and options to both business and passengers. Ferry operators providing services on Ireland to France routes are private companies and any decision to restrict access to vehicle traffic only is a commercial decision made by the companies. While one operator does restrict access to foot passengers over the winter months, there are and will continue to be alternative foot passenger options to France available all year round. These options easily cover the demand there is for foot passengers on this route which is reported as negligible at present. Covid-19 did lead to additional foot passenger capacity restrictions on some services in 2020. This was based on operators having significantly reduced capacity to meet health protocols and facilitate social distancing onboard ships, which reduced the cabin numbers available for sale. These operators report that they expect to be back to normal capacity in 2021, when they will welcome foot passengers on their French services as normal.	spk_53

Brittany Ferries is expected to provide services from Rosslare to Cherbourg and from Cork to Roscoff from March to October of next year. Both Irish Ferries and Stena Line carry foot passengers during the peak period every year. However, Stena Line carries foot passengers all year around. As the Deputy has outlined, Irish Ferries does not carry foot passengers over the winter period only, when it has an alternative vessel on the route which is more suitable to carry freight. It is understood that is for health and safety reasons. On the programme for Government, there is a commitment in place that we will work to ensure that ferry companies provide access for foot passengers without cars and the Department will shortly start engagement with Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort, the Port of Cork and the relevant shipping companies to ascertain the situation with regard to facilitating foot passengers.	spk_55

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-11-12	dail	33	Rural Transport Services	dbsect_9	The impacts of Covid-19 on the aviation industry continue to be devastating, with knock-on effects for our domestic tourism and regional economies, particularly in the west. This has been further compounded by Ryanair’s most recent decision to cut its winter capacity at Ireland West Airport Knock and to cancel all services for four weeks, from the end of next week until mid-December. Ryanair made this decision on a commercial basis in light of poor forward bookings for the period in question. It also forms part of a wider move by the airline to cut its capacity on flights right across Europe. That does not detract, however, from the impacts that this is having on Knock as well as Cork, Kerry and Shannon airports. However, I assure the Deputy that the continued viability of these airports is very important to this Government. Ireland West Airport Knock will continue to receive ongoing Exchequer support as part of the regional airports programme. This year, the airport has received capital support of more than €1 million and is also eligible to apply for operational supports from an available budget of €3.5 million.  In keeping with this Government’s priorities for regional development, I expect to publish a new regional airports programme for 2021 to 2025 in the coming weeks. This will give funding certainty to Knock airport over a five-year timeframe, helping the airport to remain viable as it transitions through the various phases of recovery from Covid. The Government has confirmed its commitment to the continuation of the programme in budget 2021 by securing more than €21 million for airports such as this. I am also pleased to refer to the additional supports agreed by Government this week as part of the revised €80 million funding package for Irish aviation. As part of this package, in addition to the €21 million secured for next year under the regional airports programme, Government intends to make a further €6 million available to Ireland's smallest airports, including Knock. The funding package will also include a €20 million airport charges rebate scheme for January to March 2021, which will support the retention of core connectivity. I will return to the Deputy's other questions.	spk_59
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-11-12	dail	33	Rural Transport Services	dbsect_9	The €6 million announced this week for our regional airports will be administered by the Department of Transport, which has begun the process of engaging with the European Commission regarding state aid rules. Ireland is an island nation and I do not have to explain to the Deputy or anyone here the importance of core connectivity. I am very hopeful that will be successful. It will then be up to the regional airports to apply for that funding through the Department. Turning to the question of testing, as I outlined earlier, the DAA will be opening drive-through testing facilities at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports. That will done through the private sector, and the private sector will also facilitate that testing across the country for airports such as Knock. The testing will be for anyone requiring such a test in advance of flying to another country or for those coming here from red or orange-listed countries who need to take a test within five days of arrival. 	spk_61

The Deputy can be assured of the certainty around that and the importance of maintaining our core connectivity. That is the reason that the Government this week provided €6 million, in addition to the €21.3 million allocated, to our regional airports. Turning to testing, again, that will be provided by the private sector. The polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test is the gold standard in this regard. It will be rolled out by the private sector. As more capacity and technology comes online and as the uptake increases, that will reduce the cost. The cost of the PCR test is considerable now, however. As the Deputy may be aware, the National Virus Reference Laboratory, NVRL, is also looking at other testing technologies, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP, tests, which may be significantly cheaper than the PCR test. If those types of test are validated and become available, they could also be options for passengers.	spk_63

I understand from the RSA that prior to the current pandemic some test centres across the country offered toilet facilities, and in some cases indoor waiting rooms, where instructors could choose to wait while their students were out undergoing their test. To be clear, some test centres around the country are very small and do not have, and have never had, large waiting rooms or toilet facilities available for instructors. As the Deputy will be aware, driver testing is continuing under level 5 restrictions, but only for candidates involved in the provision of essential services or essential retail outlets. The RSA has thus been presented with the challenge of facilitating these essential tests while at the same time safeguarding the safety of its staff and the public by minimising the risk of spreading the virus.I understand that, at present, toilet facilities at test centres are only available to the learner driver who is undertaking his or her driving test. There are no waiting area facilities available in any of the centres for either the learner or the instructor. The learner is contacted by phone while he or she is outside the centre and is then invited inside by the driver tester. The decision to temporarily close public toilet and waiting facilities has been taken by the Road Safety Authority in the interests of public safety and as part of its overall Covid-19 resumption of services protocol in line with health and safety risk assessment procedures, which had to be adopted as part of the RSA's resumption plans. I assure the Deputy that this is not a decision that has been taken lightly.

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-11-11	dail	33	Regional Airports: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_2	I thank Deputies for their valuable contributions to this important discussion. The importance of the aviation industry in terms of its contribution to Ireland's GDP, foreign direct investment, FDI, and job creation cannot be understated. Aviation plays this vital role in facilitating economic growth, but on a human level it also links different cultures and peoples. The national aviation policy, Project Ireland 2040 and the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future recognise the significant importance and value of the aviation sector in supporting economic development, international connectivity and tourism via all of our airports. When the time is appropriate and the national aviation policy is being updated, the importance of regional connectivity to a balanced and more sustainable regional development in a post Covid-19 context will be reaffirmed. The current crisis in aviation is the worst we have ever witnessed. It is an industry that tends to be extra sensitive to economic cycles and prone to shocks. This crisis has far outweighed the challenges of previous shocks such as the global financial crisis ten years ago and the aftermath of 9-11 ten years before that. I am conscious that companies have had to take difficult decisions to address their cost bases and seek to safeguard their liquidity. As part of those cost-cutting measures, many people have taken pay cuts, been temporarily laid off and, in a number of regrettable cases, lost their jobs. In recognition of the devastating impacts of Covid-19, the Government has put in place a range of measures to help our citizens and all sectors of the economy, including the aviation sector. The Government acted early in the Covid crisis and introduced unprecedented wage supports and other measures to assist businesses. Airlines, airports and others in the aviation sector are rightly availing of these substantial Government supports. In addition to these measures and in recognition of the contribution made by aviation to society and the economy here, I have advised that the Government agreed a revised funding package of almost €80 million for the Irish aviation sector yesterday. These measures are a clear indication of its commitment to ensuring that the aviation sector can maintain the necessary core capability to retain strategic connectivity and to regrow when possible. While forecasts across the airline sector do not anticipate global capacity returning to 2019 levels before 2023 or 2024, we had some welcome positive news earlier this week. We learned of encouraging early results from phase 3 trials of a vaccine announced by Pfizer. However, the National Public Health Emergency Team has advised that while this is a good first step, it is not time yet for celebration. People need to continue to stick to the basic public health measures. The news does, however, offer hope to the aviation industry. Stock markets throughout the world have reacted positively. The Government will continue to do what it can to help the aviation industry. We have implemented the EU traffic light system, including ensuring the provision of testing as an alleviation for the requirement to restrict movement on arrival into Ireland in certain circumstances. A framework is now in place for people travelling from the green, red and orange regions of Europe. There are several Covid-19 testing technologies currently available or emerging on the commercial market. Importantly, though, testing provision under Ireland's framework for international travel will not be provided through the public health system but rather will be met by the private commercial sector testing supply on a user-pays basis. All of these measures have been put in place to ensure that the aviation industry will be in the best possible shape when air travel returns to some kind of normality. I am confident that it will, given time. I have listened closely to all the contributions made this morning. I assure Deputies that I am committed to ensuring that we can maintain strategic connectivity and the viability of our airports so that the sector is well positioned to return once again to being a key driver of the economy and to help facilitate a wider economic recovery. This position is reflected in the countermotion I have put forward.	spk_21
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-11-11	dail	33	Driver Test	dbsect_19	I thank Deputy Funchion for raising this really important matter. The driver test service and the driver theory test are the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority, RSA. The Department has been in constant contact with the RSA since the start of the pandemic regarding all of its services, the impact of Covid-19 on those services and how they can best be maintained in the current circumstances. As the Deputy is aware car driving tests were temporarily suspended due to Covid-19 in March 2020. Since the resumption of operations in mid July there has inevitably been an increased level of demand due to the consequent backlog. Unfortunately, due to social distancing and other public health and hygiene requirements, service capacity has had to be considerably reduced. This means that customers are experiencing longer waiting times than was the case before the service was suspended. Level 5 restrictions, which took effect for six weeks on 22 October, mean that driving tests are now only available to those who are involved in essential services, including essential retail work. While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety must remain of paramount importance. The Road Safety Authority is currently examining ways of increasing the number of tests, within health constraints, when driver testing resumes after level 5 and is working in close consultation with the Department on this matter. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce, and over time to eliminate, the backlog. The Department has recently approved the retention by the RSA of 18 temporary driving testers whose contracts were due to expire in October and November. The RSA has also re-hired a further 18 temporary testers whose contracts expired in May. This will help to increase testing capacity when services resume. In the longer term, the Department is considering proposals by the RSA for further measures to address the backlog. The driver theory test had not been deemed as an essential service under level 5. As a consequence the services closed effective from midnight on Wednesday, 21 October for the duration of level 5 restrictions. All appointments during that time have been rescheduled to the next available appointment date. As I am sure the Deputy is aware that the theory test service was temporarily suspended in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 emergency. When the service resumed in June there was an increased level of demand and a significant backlog developed. This was coupled with the need to reduce significantly normal daily capacity to comply with occupational and public health requirements.When the driver theory test service closed on 21 October due to the latest restrictions, the majority of testing centres had almost full bookings up to the end of December, and some into January, as they worked their way through the initial backlog. The decision was taken by the service provider that those whose appointments were cancelled due to the latest restrictions would be rescheduled to the next available appointment date. The Road Safety Authority has advised my office it is engaging with the service provider to examine ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints for when services are resumed. This will help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog. The Department has requested that the Road Safety Authority, as the body legally responsible for the driver theory test, examine whether theory tests can be taken online remotely and what is required to do so. I understand the authority is developing proposals in this regard but this planning is at a very early stage and it is not expected to come on stream in the immediate future.	spk_180

My understanding is that the 36 figure refers to the number of extra driver testers who will be in place. I know how concerned many constituents are about this and while the service is limited during level 5 restrictions, the Road Safety Authority is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within the health constraints, with an eye on resuming the wider testing level after level 5.

They will be additional. This will help to increase the testing capacity. However, it is important to stress there are many issues impacting on the delivery of the service, which relate to throughput in the centres in light of the restrictions rather than the availability of staff alone. There are a number of health protocols that need to be adhered to with regard to the testing system. The Road Safety Authority is also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased within the current health constraints. Due to the additional hygiene and sanitation procedures that are now absolutely necessary, each testing slot takes a lot longer to complete. As a result, the number of tests a tester can safely conduct per day was reduced from eight to five when the service reopened. Following its experience of managing the tests under Covid restrictions, this was increased to six in mid-September.

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-11-10	dail	33	Confidence in Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment: Motion	dbsect_15	The Tánaiste gave a full and frank account of his actions and motivations last week in this House and took considerable time answering Deputies' questions. Today is two hours of statements and counter statements, a rehash of last week's events when we are in the midst of the most serious health crisis to face our nation and staring down the barrel of a no-deal Brexit. We will spend valuable Dáil time today making speeches about a document the detail of which was in the public domain when the then Taoiseach passed it on. Medical journalists were writing detailed articles on the deal before this document was shared. This was not some State secret being passed to the enemy as some on the Opposition benches would spin it. I remind the House that we are expecting a large budget deficit of €22 billion in 2020. Government debt is high in historical and international terms and is a risk to the public finances and the economy. There are hundreds of thousands of people unemployed and businesses worried if they will ever reopen yet we are here at considerable cost to the taxpayer debating a motion for no good reason other than political opportunism. I am not for one minute saying that any member of Government, or this House for that matter, should be unaccountable; they most certainly should be accountable.  The Tánaiste made himself available and accountable last week for detailed questioning by Deputies. He answered completely and honestly. He has admitted he should have done things differently and he apologised for it. Everyone in politics makes mistakes. It is human nature. Some mistakes are more serious than others. The Tánaiste's error is certainly not one that warrants resignation. It was a mistake of process rather than substance. I very much appreciate that the Opposition will make hay while the sun shines and attempt to make out that every error is some national crisis. That is politics, but it is bad politics. We have steadied the ship during the Covid-19 pandemic and I am particularly conscious of the leading role Leo Varadkar took in that. He has my full confidence.	spk_172

Although the Government is opposing the motion, I wish to put on the record that I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by the Deputies who put down the motion, as the network has the capacity to do more business for the Government. All Members agree on the end point, but where we differ is on how to get there. I commend An Post and postmasters on the community initiatives put in place in response to Covid-19 which have been implemented with such goodwill and efficiency throughout the country. Throughout the pandemic, An Post has kept its network of 940 post offices open, playing a hugely important commercial and societal role in communities. Most recently, An Post announced that it will ensure free delivery of all card and letter mail posted to or from residents of nursing and care homes until the end of January. Enabling family, friends and colleagues to keep in touch is of great importance. The support provided to the elderly and most vulnerable through this and other important initiatives is an invaluable service during these times. An Post, postmasters and the network are facing their own particular challenges. The ongoing decline in core mail volumes through e-substitution has seen An Post working hard to diversify its business in recent years and to seek new business opportunities. Deputies will recall that even before Covid-19 there were huge challenges for the business, with mail volumes declining by 6.3% in 2019, resulting in a €25 million decrease in revenue. An Post estimates that Covid has probably accelerated this process of volume decline by two to three years. A further difficulty in that regard is that once customers have adapted to digital alternatives, they rarely return to sending mail and, as such, the decline is likely to be permanent. Like many other aspects of our lives, the way in which the public accesses Government services is likely to have been profoundly affected by the pandemic. We need to consider these changes and our response to them very carefully. To take the example of motor tax, under the existing arrangements, motor tax is payable in person or by post through motor tax offices in 26 local authorities. It is also payable online at any time, with the level of online usage increasing from 42% of all motor tax transactions in 2010 to just under 79% at the end of last year. Although overall motor tax transactions have reduced slightly in recent months due to Covid-19, the percentage of online transactions has increased significantly during that time, averaging 92% of all motor tax transactions. We need to consider our overall approach to offline service provision in light of our experience, and not in terms of individual services but rather as a whole. Rather than considering individual services, a centrally driven, whole-of-government approach to offline service provision, similar to the adoption of digital government, would help to realise the commitment in the programme for Government to a sustainable nationwide post office network. I am considering the report of the offline services group with a view to bringing it to the Government in the weeks ahead. The Government has recognised in its programme that a modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprise. We need to be imaginative and to explore other ways to use the post office network. The Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made reference in the House last week to the potential to use post offices as hubs for remote working. Engagement has already begun with An Post and I am keen to work with it to explore this potential. It has also been imaginative, diversifying and expanding the services it offers. It recently launched its green hub facility as a one-stop shop for home retrofitting. New services such as these will drive footfall through post offices. There is no doubt that Covid has had a negative effect on post office footfall, with an estimated 25% decrease in transactions. Social welfare cash payments, which were reduced to a fortnightly payment in March, will return to a weekly payment of on 2 November. This announcement has been welcomed by postmasters. The recent report commissioned by the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, on the post office network states that without the introduction of a public service obligation and further Government services through the post office network to increase turnover, the network faces an annual shortfall of €17 million per annum from 2021 onwards. These issues need to be addressed quickly and I can assure Deputies that work is under way in this regard. A significant amount of time and effort has been spent in the past three years working on restructuring An Post, and I acknowledge the work of my predecessors in that regard. This work was critical to save An Post and protect jobs and the post office network. An Post has invested in training for all post offices in 2019 and 2020 to better equip postmasters to run their business, manage a profit and loss account and promote their businesses locally. Significant investment has been made in redefining the network, including reducing the number of post offices, modernising the postmaster contract and updating the brand.The consolidation of the post office network has assured the widest possible distribution across the State with an ever-improving network. The focus of the business is on developing a full range of financial services which will mitigate the ongoing reductions on the retail side. The key focus continues to be on future-proofing the company and keeping it relevant to its customers with regard to the types of services it provides. This restructuring has seen the development of new areas of business, particularly in parcel delivery but also in new retail areas and in financial services, which has resulted in a return to annual profitability since implementation of the plan first began. It is important to remember that, as with any business, it needs to grow and develop new products and meet the changing needs of its customers. An Post already has a significant presence in financial services, providing local banking through approximately 940 branches. In recent years, it has launched a current account, a credit card offering and loans. It also has a growing foreign exchange business. It has expanded in the area of e-commerce and has seen massive growth in its parcel business as well as in new green initiatives, placing sustainability at the heart of its business and adapting its fleet to provide zero carbon emission deliveries in Dublin. An investment loan of €40 million from the European Investment Bank aims to support the implementation of a number of the projects underpinning An Post's strategic plan including post office renewal to allow An Post to offer upgraded retail services in fit-for-purpose outlets with appropriate digital and physical infrastructure. Government made €30 million available in State funding to support the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a 5-day-per-week mail delivery service. This reflects the Government commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mail service. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has also recently approved a capital expenditure programme which, as part of the company's commitment to the sustainability of its network, is designed to develop the newer elements of An Post's financial services business and mitigate declining core mail volumes and revenues on the retail side of the business. Government acknowledges that An Post has the potential to provide additional Government services. As the Minister of State responsible for An Post, I intend to work closely with the company to see if there is scope to channel more services through the network. It is my intention that all options will be considered fully and that efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network.	spk_6

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-10-21	dail	33	Railway Safety (Reporting and Investigation of Serious Accidents, Accidents and Incidents involving Certain Railways) Bill 2020: Second Stage	dbsect_12	"I move: “That the Bill be now read a Second Time.” The Bill is to provide a statutory basis for a continuation of the powers of the Railway Accident Investigation Unit, RAIU for the reporting and investigation of serious accidents and incidents involving certain categories of railways that are specified in section 3. The RAIU is the independent statutory body that carries out railway accident investigations in the State. I refer to the background to this matter. The EU railway safety directive of 2004, Directive 2004/49/EC, established a common regulatory framework for railway safety across member states through the harmonisation of safety rules, certification, the roles of national safety authorities and investigation of accidents. The directive required that member states established an independent national investigation body and to that end the RAIU was established here. The objective of the RAIU investigation is to identify the causes of accidents but it is also a means to improving railway safety in general and preventing future accidents from happening. I am sure that all Deputies will agree that in the operation of the State's railways, safety is paramount. To enable this, it is essential that the RAIU has a strong statutory basis to underpin its role in regard to the reporting and investigation of accidents and incidents on our railways.  The EU railway safety directive of 2004 applied to all categories of railways and the provisions in chapter 5 of the directive for the investigation of accidents were transposed here in the European Union (Railway Safety) (Reporting and Investigation of Serious Accidents, Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 2014. These regulations are referred to in the Bill as ""Regulations of 2014"". The RAIU was conferred with powers and functions under the 2014 regulations in respect of all railways. This includes heavy rail, that is, the railway operations on the Iarnród Éireann network and light rail, which includes the Luas tram railway in Dublin. Those powers and functions also covered the metros and other railways such as heritage railways, of which there are a number throughout the country.  The need for the provisions in this Bill arise from a change in law at EU level. Under the EU fourth railway package agreed in 2016, the EU railway safety directive of 2004 is being repealed and is being recast by Directive EU (2016) 789 on railway safety. This replacement directive, which I will refer to as the recast railway safety directive, will come into operation on 31 October 2020. The focus of the EU fourth railway package is on the promotion of the rail market in a single European railway area and on the technical interoperability of the Union railway system to support rail passenger and freight transport services. As a result of this, the recast railway safety directive has a reduced scope and it expressly excludes light railways, metro and other local railway systems. In the context of the railway systems in Ireland it is only heavy rail, that is, the railway operations on Iarnród Éireann's network, including the DART, that now come within the scope of the recast railway safety directive. Last week, the Minister for Transport made the European Union (Railway Safety) (Reporting and Investigation of Serious Accidents, Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 2020. These regulations are referred to in the Bill as ""Regulations of 2020"".These regulations transpose Chapter V of the recast railway safety directive and provide the railway accident investigation unit, RAIU, with investigatory powers and functions in respect of the As the regulations of 2020 only provide the RAIU with the necessary powers and functions to carry out reporting and investigations in respect of The Bill also contains saver and continuity safeguards to provide for a seamless continuity of the work of the RAIU as regards investigations that are under way at present or reports that are in preparation or existing reports and safety recommendations. The net effect will be that the  It has taken some time to get this RAIU related legislative proposal published in a Bill. Steps were initiated in 2018 to bring forward a legislative provision to address the matter that is in the present Bill. A head was included in the general scheme for a Railway Safety (Amendment) Bill 2018 which advanced as far as it being subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny by the relevant Oireachtas joint committee in June 2018. Since then, however, while the Bill was included in the Government’s legislative programme, it was not possible to progress it, mainly due to the competing demands of other priority legislation, including those relating to Brexit. Towards the end of 2019, because of the increasing urgency attaching to this issue, the Department developed the provisions into a single-issue Bill and, at the same time, explored the option of attaching these provisions to some other priority legislation within the Department’s remit that was close to being published. However, those options were effectively closed off when the general election was called earlier this year and, since then, the extended impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has removed any opportunity for progressing the matter until now. I will give a short overview of the Bill’s provisions. Section 1 is a standard Interpretation section to provide for the specific terms used in the Bill. The terms “heritage railway”, “investigation unit”, “light railway”, “metro” and “public road” are existing terms under other Acts and the relevant cross references are given. The term “regulations of 2014” refers to the regulations that transposed into Irish law the previous EU Railway Safety Directive 2004/49/EC and which gives the RAIU a statutory basis to investigate accidents involving all railways. “Regulations of 2020” refer to the statutory instrument that was made by the Minister for Transport on 13 October 2020 and transpose the relevant part of the new recast railway safety directive. As already mentioned, these give the RAIU a statutory basis to investigate accidents involving heavy rail only. Section 2 is also a standard provision and provides for the commencement of the proposed Act on 31 October 2020. As I mentioned already, the recast railway safety directive comes into operation on 31 October 2020, which is why this Bill is needed to be enacted by that date. Section 3 on reporting and investigation of accidents is the main provision in the Bill. This section provides that the regulations of 2020 will apply to the other types of railway that are not included within the scope of the recast railway safety directive. These include metros, trams and other light railway systems, including the Luas. They also include privately owned rail networks used for freight, to the extent that those railways interface with public roads or with another railway system. As Deputies may be aware, there is one such railway currently operational in Ireland and that is the extensive Bord na Móna network used for its peat operations. Heritage railways are also included and there are a number of these throughout the country, including in Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Laois, Leitrim and Waterford. The running of vintage steam train leisure excursions on the Iarnród Éireann network are also covered. Through the operation of section 3, the regulations of 2020 will therefore apply to all of these railways, as well as to the heavy rail network. Sections 4 to 6, inclusive, are, once again, standard provisions that seek to ensure the continuity of the reporting and investigation work that the RAIU has done to date and is continuing to do at present. Section 4 ensures that any investigation and the preparation of any report that have been already commenced by the RAIU under the regulations of 2014 can continue and be completed under the regulations of 2020 from 31 October 2020. Section 5 ensures the continuity of any relevant existing investigation reports or other reports of the RAIU and section 6 ensures the continuity of any relevant safety recommendations issued by the RAIU prior to 31 October 2020. Section 7 is a standard citation provision. This is an important Bill to provide that the RAIU is provided with full statutory powers to enable it to continue in a seamless manner from 31 October 2020, to carry out reporting and investigation into accidents and incidents involving all railways. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the Deputies’ contributions."	spk_215

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-10-20	dail	33	Water Quality	dbsect_45	I thank Deputy Calleary for providing me with the opportunity to speak about the impact of Covid-19 at Ireland West Airport Knock and, in particular, with regard to the decision of Ryanair to reduce its services. Like all airports, Ireland West Airport Knock has been fully exposed to the intense decline in global aviation activity and, unfortunately, the decline has been further compounded by Ryanair's announcement to cut its winter capacity at the airport. As a key player in delivering high-quality international connectivity to the western region, I am fully aware of the significant impact of this latest news on the airport. Of course, the decision by Ryanair to cut flights was part of a wider move by the company to cut its capacity on flights right across Europe. This development, therefore, was not entirely unexpected given the low booking rates to the end of this year. The challenges faced by the aviation industry are immense and totally unprecedented in living memory. In that context, I fully appreciate the growing concerns regarding the long-term economic viability of many airports, particularly smaller aviation enterprises like Ireland West Airport Knock. I want to assure Deputy Calleary, however, that the continued viability of these airports is important to this Government. As the Deputy will be aware, policy on regional airports seeks to optimise conditions for regional development and connectivity both for social and economic benefits. As employers, they contribute to the local economy and employment is also supported through the various ancillary services they provide. This is why this Government took strong and immediate action to assist business and protect employment at the outset of this crisis. A comprehensive suite of generalised supports for all companies has been put in place. These include the wage subsidy schemes, grants, low-cost loans, the waiver of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities.  Ireland West Airport Knock has received a range of supports through these measures. That aside, I am aware that Ireland West Airport Knock is still experiencing an unprecedented strain on its financial resources and has made very difficult decisions to manage that in a responsible way. Where lay-offs have arisen, people have been supported through the Government's pandemic unemployment payment, PUP. Ryanair's announcement can only have made matters worse in that regard and I empathise with all the employees at the airport, both directly and indirectly, who are impacted by this announcement. Unfortunately, this situation is not unique to any one airport in Ireland or, indeed, internationally at present. I wish to remind the Deputy, however, that Ireland West Airport Knock is one of the airports receiving Exchequer support as part of this Government's regional airports programme. Historically, Ireland West Airport Knock has been well supported through this Government-backed programme. Last year, for example, it received €9.4 million in Exchequer funds. The majority of that funding went towards its runway overlay project. This year to date, Ireland West Airport Knock has received capital support of over €1 million and it is also eligible to apply for operational supports under the programme. My Department recently invited Ireland West Airport Knock, along with Donegal and Kerry airports, to apply for current funding of which a total of €3.5 million is available this year. This funding is typically paid to eligible airports in December of every year. Last December, for example, Ireland West Airport Knock received over €1.7 million in operational supports. In keeping with this Government's priorities for regional development I am currently finalising a new regional airports programme for 2021 to 2025. This will give funding certainty to Ireland West Airport Knock over a five-year timeframe, helping the airport to remain viable as it transitions through the various phases of Covid-19. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have secured €21.3 million in funding for the programme in 2021. I wish to advise the Deputy that all support mechanisms for the aviation sector will continue to be reviewed in the context of the Government's plans for international travel, having regard to the recommendations of the aviation task force and the forthcoming national economic plan.	spk_447

Like all airports, Ireland West Airport Knock has been fully exposed to the intense decline in global aviation activity and, unfortunately, the decline has been further compounded by Ryanair's announcement to cut its winter capacity at the airport. As a key player in delivering high-quality international connectivity to the western region, I am fully aware of the significant impact of this latest news on the airport. Of course, the decision by Ryanair to cut flights was part of a wider move by the company to cut its capacity on flights right across Europe.

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-10-15	dail	33	Financial Resolution No. 7 - General: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_22	When my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, addressed the House yesterday, he outlined the planned investment of €3.5 billion to fund projects and programmes under the Department's transport remit in 2021. An increase of €617 million, or 33%, in capital will allow the Department to continue with its investment in capital expenditure under the national development plan, despite the major challenges created by Covid-19. Today, I wish to outline in more detail how this investment will impact the road, maritime and aviation sectors. The impact of Covid-19 is still evident on our road network. Road traffic volumes fell dramatically in spring due to Covid-19 travel restrictions. The volumes fell to around one third of the 2019 levels during April. The volumes recovered significantly as restrictions eased and appear to have plateaued recently at around 80% of 2019 levels. Road construction works were also suspended during the peak Covid-19 restrictions before recommencing in May. Despite the above Covid-19 impacts, I am pleased to inform the House that there have been no significant delays to investment in the roads programme arising from Covid-19. In 2021, we will invest €1.3 billion in our road network, with a national roads budget of €799 million. We will continue the extensive roads programme, with the following projects all at construction stage: the N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin in Sligo; the N22 Ballyvourney to Macroom upgrade scheme; the N5 Westport to Turlough Road; the N56 Dungloe to Glenties; M8-N40-N25 Dunkettle interchange upgrade; and the M50 enhancing motorway operations by introducing variable speed limits. To ensure that our road network is of the highest standard, an additional €15 million has been provided towards the maintenance of the regional and local roads network. This will assist in progressing towards a steady State level of investment in the network to ensure that the necessary expenditure required to hold the network in its existing condition and avoid further deterioration is provided. This brings the total maintenance and investment budget for regional and local roads to €555 million. Construction work on a number of important regional local road projects will be progressed, including the Sallins bypass; Bettystown to Laytown link road; Coonagh to Knockalisheen distributor road; and the Tralee northern relief road. In 2021, allocation includes funding to re-seal and strengthen roads across the network. Funding will also be provided for safety improvement works, bridge rehabilitation works, maintenance of former national roads and community involvement schemes. This will assist in the sustainable use of our roads by the wider community for walking, cycling, as well as cars, buses and road haulage. The Department appreciates that within the overall parameters set for the grant programme, local authorities might need to target funding at particular problem areas and there is sufficient flexibility in the structure of the grant programme to allow for this. Apart from a requirement that a minimum of 15% of the restoration and improvement grant is spent on the more heavily trafficked regional roads, each local authority has the discretion to decide on allocations to other categories of road. It is also open to each local authority to allocate its own resources to priority areas.  One key area that I wish to progress is improving safety for children and families who wish to cycle to school. A few weeks ago, I met the National Transport Authority to discuss how best to deliver on the programme for Government commitment in this area. I am delighted that budget 2021 provides the funding required to allow us to develop a safe routes to school programme and see it commenced next year. Budget 2021 provides for a spend of approximately €1 million per day to support walking and cycling infrastructure. Those allocations can deliver real change in terms of how our children get to and from their schools. As part of this change, safe routes to school will see enhancements and improvements to the front of school environments to better promote sustainable and safe entry to and exit from school grounds, expanded provision for bicycle parking at all schools across the country and delivery of improved walking and cycling infrastructure to schools. The benefits of this investment will not only improve facilities for walking and cycling, it will mean better physical health, improved air quality, less congestion and better places to live. The sum of €108 million has been allocated to ensure the safety and competitiveness of maritime transport services and the productive and safe use of our seas. My Department is responsible for the survey, certification, licensing and inspection of vessels, certification of seafarers and also the inspection and approval of ports and port facilities. This also includes an additional €2.8 million in capital funding for the Irish Coast Guard and Commissioner of Irish Lights, which will also ensure the provision of an effective emergency response service for marine search and rescue through the Irish Coast Guard. There is also funding of €31.3 million for the aviation sector, €21.3 million for the regional airports programme and an additional €10 million in capital support for Cork and Shannon Airports.	spk_194
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-09-24	dail	33	Regional Airports	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy for his question. The Government's approach to international travel to date has sought to protect public health and contain the disease while respecting that in certain circumstances travel will be essential. Under the plan for living with Covid-19, it is proposed that Ireland will broadly support the European Commission proposals on a co-ordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. We will continue to engage with member states and the Commission to develop a regime that is consistent with the public health requirements. The European Commission proposal is to promote a common approach to travel restrictions and movement within EU. A co-ordinated approach among member states requires joint efforts on four key points: the application of common criteria and thresholds in deciding whether to introduce restrictions to free movement; the mapping of common criteria using an agreed colour code; the adoption of a common approach as to the measures applied to persons moving to and from areas identified as higher risk; and providing the public with clear, comprehensive and timely information about any restrictions and accompanying requirements. The proposal from the Commission is still under consideration by member states, but there are three components. These are common use of EpiData to determine which country is on which list, quarantine or self-restrictions, and testing at airports. Preparations for the implementation of the European Commission proposal will ensure that the establishment of pre-departure or on-arrival testing arrangements for incoming travellers do not impact on the testing and tracing of symptomatic patients and serial testing of high-risk groups or workplace environments. My Department is, therefore, engaging with Department of Health and the HSE in looking at possible ways to provide for a robust testing or screening regime that is consistent with public health requirements and cognisant of resources and capacity available in the health sector for the testing and tracing of the general public, to allow for an increase in international travel.	spk_22

It will factor in projected passenger demand and availability of testing supply capacity and that will inform our decision making. A significant concern is that whatever testing regime is put in place, it should not have an impact on our own public health testing capacity. We are all mindful of that.

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-09-23	dail	33	Rail Network	dbsect_11	"I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. We are all aware that the irresponsible and antisocial use of scramblers and quads can cause death or serious injury, as well as wider disturbance and nuisance. The incident to which both Deputies alluded is a good example of the dangers involved. Many of these vehicles are used by minors and are provided to them by family members and others, who are also acting irresponsibly, putting the users and others at risk. As Minister of State, I have responsibility for legislation in the area of vehicles and the area of traffic on public roads. Scrambler motorbikes and quadricycle bikes are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles. It is an offence to supply a mechanically propelled vehicle to anyone under the age of 16, and to supply one to a person under 17 unless it is a vehicle of a class which can legally be driven by a 16 year old. ""Supply"" in this context covers selling, renting, loaning, giving as a gift, or any other form of making the vehicle available to a minor. Under road traffic legislation, the user of a scrambler or quad bike in a public place must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence and must also wear a helmet. There are stringent penalties under the road traffic laws for not being in compliance with these requirements. For the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts, a public place means any public road and any street, road or other place to which the public has access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge. Road traffic legislation does not extend to private property, including municipal or other publicly owned parks which are under the control of local authorities and subject to their by-laws. Enforcement of legislation is the responsibility of the Garda. If a person supplies a vehicle to a minor or uses a quad bike or scrambler in a public place without tax or insurance, or in contravention of any other law, the Garda has the legal powers to address these matters. The laws available to address the scrambler problem include not only those under my Department but also public order legislation under the Department of Justice and Equality which can be applied in parks. Local authorities have the power to introduce by-laws to prohibit the use of vehicles in areas under their control. The unauthorised use of off-road vehicles is prohibited in certain national parks and the Minister with responsibility for rural and Gaeltacht affairs has powers to prohibit their unauthorised use. We know that the problem of antisocial and dangerous behaviour involving scramblers and quads continues. This raises questions of how best to tackle the problem and one aspect of that is looking at whether changes to legislation would help. A working group was set up by the Department of Justice and Equality that looked at a cross-agency approach to tackling the illegal use of quad bikes and scramblers during 2019. The group includes representatives from my Department, as well as the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Courts Service and the Garda. One option considered related to the fact that the Road Traffic Acts apply to a ""public place"", a legal term which does not include a public park. As many of the problems with scramblers and quads arise in public parks, there were suggestions that redefining a public place to include a public park might help by extending certain Garda powers into parks. However, following legal advice, it became clear that this would create serious unintended consequences. The concept of a public place is fundamental to traffic law and redefining a park as a public place would mean extending a vast body of traffic law into parks with a wide range of consequent legal difficulties. It is most likely that a comprehensive solution will have to involve a range of measures including legislation, enforcement and public education, as the Deputies have outlined."	spk_218
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-09-23	dail	33	Rail Network	dbsect_11	I thank the Deputies. As I stated, under the Road Traffic Acts, there are already comprehensive measures in place for the Garda to deal with vehicles, including scramblers, quads and similar vehicles, in public places. In addition, there are also forms of legislation which allow for dealing with them outside public places and anyone supplying them to a minor can be prosecuted. Alternatives have been considered and I understand that the working group on this matter met earlier this year and is to meet again next week to review the situation. If a viable proposal that would help us to protect the public from dangerous and improper use of these vehicles were to emerge, and it fell within my remit, I would be happy to propose the necessary legislative changes. This might involve being able to adapt some powers under traffic law to be used in parks, without the major unintended consequences which come from the redefinition of a public place. I have to add that whatever laws are used, whether they come from the transport or justice remit or other Departments, there will always be difficulty in enforcing them. The Garda must take account of public safety and chasing scramblers or quads could put the users or bystanders at risk. This is one of the greatest difficulties with these machines and there are no easy solutions. It is most likely that a comprehensive solution will involve a range of measures, including, perhaps, new legislation from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or new public order legislation from the Department of Justice and Equality. It will also involve enforcement and public education on the purchase and use of these vehicles.	spk_221

We are all aware that the irresponsible and antisocial use of scramblers and quads can cause death or serious injury, as well as wider disturbance and nuisance. The incident to which both Deputies alluded is a good example of the dangers involved. Many of these vehicles are used by minors and are provided to them by family members and others, who are also acting irresponsibly, putting the users and others at risk. As Minister of State, I have responsibility for legislation in the area of vehicles and the area of traffic on public roads. Scrambler motorbikes and quadricycle bikes are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles. It is an offence to supply a mechanically propelled vehicle to anyone under the age of 16, and to supply one to a person under 17 unless it is a vehicle of a class which can legally be driven by a 16 year old. ""Supply"" in this context covers selling, renting, loaning, giving as a gift, or any other form of making the vehicle available to a minor. Under road traffic legislation, the user of a scrambler or quad bike in a public place must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence and must also wear a helmet. There are stringent penalties under the road traffic laws for not being in compliance with these requirements. For the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts, a public place means any public road and any street, road or other place to which the public has access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge. Road traffic legislation does not extend to private property, including municipal or other publicly owned parks which are under the control of local authorities and subject to their by-laws. Enforcement of legislation is the responsibility of the Garda. If a person supplies a vehicle to a minor or uses a quad bike or scrambler in a public place without tax or insurance, or in contravention of any other law, the Garda has the legal powers to address these matters. The laws available to address the scrambler problem include not only those under my Department but also public order legislation under the Department of Justice and Equality which can be applied in parks. Local authorities have the power to introduce by-laws to prohibit the use of vehicles in areas under their control. The unauthorised use of off-road vehicles is prohibited in certain national parks and the Minister with responsibility for rural and Gaeltacht affairs has powers to prohibit their unauthorised use. We know that the problem of antisocial and dangerous behaviour involving scramblers and quads continues. This raises questions of how best to tackle the problem and one aspect of that is looking at whether changes to legislation would help. A working group was set up by the Department of Justice and Equality that looked at a cross-agency approach to tackling the illegal use of quad bikes and scramblers during 2019. The group includes representatives from my Department, as well as the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Courts Service and the Garda. One option considered related to the fact that the Road Traffic Acts apply to a ""public place"", a legal term which does not include a public park. As many of the problems with scramblers and quads arise in public parks, there were suggestions that redefining a public place to include a public park might help by extending certain Garda powers into parks. However, following legal advice, it became clear that this would create serious unintended consequences. The concept of a public place is fundamental to traffic law and redefining a park as a public place would mean extending a vast body of traffic law into parks with a wide range of consequent legal difficulties. It is most likely that a comprehensive solution will have to involve a range of measures including legislation, enforcement and public education, as the Deputies have outlined."	spk_218
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-09-23	dail	33	Road Traffic Legislation	dbsect_14	I thank the Deputies. As I stated, under the Road Traffic Acts, there are already comprehensive measures in place for the Garda to deal with vehicles, including scramblers, quads and similar vehicles, in public places. In addition, there are also forms of legislation which allow for dealing with them outside public places and anyone supplying them to a minor can be prosecuted. Alternatives have been considered and I understand that the working group on this matter met earlier this year and is to meet again next week to review the situation. If a viable proposal that would help us to protect the public from dangerous and improper use of these vehicles were to emerge, and it fell within my remit, I would be happy to propose the necessary legislative changes. This might involve being able to adapt some powers under traffic law to be used in parks, without the major unintended consequences which come from the redefinition of a public place. I have to add that whatever laws are used, whether they come from the transport or justice remit or other Departments, there will always be difficulty in enforcing them. The Garda must take account of public safety and chasing scramblers or quads could put the users or bystanders at risk. This is one of the greatest difficulties with these machines and there are no easy solutions. It is most likely that a comprehensive solution will involve a range of measures, including, perhaps, new legislation from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or new public order legislation from the Department of Justice and Equality. It will also involve enforcement and public education on the purchase and use of these vehicles.	spk_221
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-09-23	dail	33	Covid-19 (Transport): Statements	dbsect_16	I wish to reiterate the points the Minister made in terms of the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on our transport sector and international networks. I have had several meetings with stakeholders in both the aviation and maritime sectors and I am acutely aware of the financial precipice on which they find themselves. I profoundly hope that the adoption of the broad EU approach to facilitating international travel next month will provide certainty and clarity for these sectors and enable their viable operation into 2021. Considering the impact of Covid-19 on international travel and global supply chains, one of my key priorities is to ensure continuity of transport links to and from Ireland as well as ensuring that goods can continue to move throughout Ireland. During March and April, a drop in overall freight activity levels was evident given the temporary closure of many retail outlets and construction sites in Ireland and abroad. While supply chains are functioning well at the present time, we continue to closely monitor them. As more shops and construction sites reopened through the phases of recovery and as other economies abroad began to reopen, business began to increase for hauliers. Heavy goods vehicle traffic on our roads has rebounded for the most part to 100% of pre-Covid traffic levels. Given the importance of the work of our road haulage sector during these difficult times, my Department implemented a number of measures to support the continued functioning of the sector in recent months, including a prolonged temporary derogation for certain provisions of the EU driving and rest hours rules, which expired at the end of May; the extension of expiry dates on driver certificate of professional competence cards of a maximum of six months up to 26 September; and the extension of validity periods for driver licences. In addition, a number of communications have also been issued to help support the freight sector as it operates through these challenging times such as the public health guidance developed to assist hauliers in the safe operation of their job in an international environment. While lockdowns and other co-ordinated restrictive measures were implemented as necessary this year to save lives, these measures have also severely slowed down economies across the EU and can delay the delivery of critical goods and services. Working in co-operation with member states, the European Commission has taken a number of measures to ensure continued and uninterrupted land, water-borne and air cargo services. These services are of crucial importance for the functioning of the EU's internal market and its effective response to the current public health crisis. Continuing in this vein, member states, under the stewardship of the German Presidency, are now calling on the Commission to consider drawing up a pandemic and crisis contingency plan for the European freight transport sector. I consider such a plan to be prudent. We must avoid a situation where member states act unilaterally to adopt their own diverging contingency measures. Being on the western extreme of the EU supply chain Ireland has a heavy reliance on all member states working together to ensure that goods can move freely across the EU and beyond, not just for land transport services but also for our shipping and aviation services. Roadworks were suspended during the peak Covid-19 restrictions before recommencing in May. Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has not reported significant national road project delays, although a slightly reduced productivity level has been noted. Just this week I was delighted to announce with the Minister the completion of a significant €14 million safety investment for the N60 in Roscommon. As well as the investment in active travel noted by the Minister, on foot of the Government's July stimulus package more than €10 million was awarded by the Department's regional and local roads division to local authorities for climate adaptation works. Under climate change adaptation measures, 273 projects are to be completed this year involving 150 schemes aimed at alleviating flooding to roads and property, 37 involving works to improve embankment stability to prevent slippage, 41 relating to essential road repairs associated with severe weather and 45 to bridge strengthening and repairs. Operationally, road traffic volumes fell dramatically in spring due to Covid-19 travel restrictions to approximately one third of 2019 levels during April. They then recovered significantly as restrictions eased and appear to have plateaued recently at approximately 80% of 2019 levels. That is in contrast to public transport volumes, which remain depressed. Despite this fall in road traffic, however, road fatalities are higher than at this time last year. This is seriously concerning to me and, I am sure, to all Members. I appeal to our citizens to always drive safely. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a number of essential road safety services delivered by my Department and its agencies were closed or severely reduced. The national driver licence service, NDLS, the national car test, the commercial vehicle roadworthiness test and the driver testing and driver theory testing services closed in March 2020 as they could not be continued at that time in light of overriding considerations of public health. As a result, the Government moved to extend validity periods of the relevant permits and certificates to ensure people, including essential transport workers, could continue to drive, ensuring continued access to and provision of essential services. All services have now reopened although due to social distancing requirements not all are able to return to their pre-Covid capacity, and there remains some backlog. The Road Safety Authority, RSA, which operates the national driver licence service on behalf of the Department, continues to work with its providers to see how they can increase capacity within the NDLS while adhering to the return to work protocol. The RSA also hopes to extend its online services over the coming months, subject to the appropriate legislation and technical solutions being put in place. The driver theory test system capacity since resumption has increased on pre-Covid levels with 19,000 tests per months as against 15,000 tests but the scale of the backlog, combined with the time of year when many school leavers will apply, means increased waiting lists. The RSA is working with the service provider to see how capacity can be further increased. My Department has already approved the retention and hiring of a number of temporary testers to assist in the situation. The authority recently submitted a comprehensive plan for addressing the demands on the service, which is being considered by my Department. It is important to be realistic. There are no easy fixes, and public health and safety must come first. The transport sector has faced an unprecedented disruption over the past six months due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our priority as a Government is to support it through the coming year, ensuring its safe and continued operation, maintain our essential international connectivity, and protect its ongoing and fundamental contribution to our economy.	spk_227
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-09-16	dail	33	Flood Relief Schemes	dbsect_13	I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Eamon Ryan. The national broadband plan, NBP, contract was signed with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, in November 2019 to roll out a high-speed and future-proofed broadband network within the intervention area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in nearly 540,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms and 695 schools. The national broadband plan will ensure that citizens throughout the entire country have access to high-speed broadband services and that nobody is left without this vital service. The NBP network will offer users a high-speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500 Mbps from the outset. I should point out that this represents an increase from the 150 Mbps committed to under the contract. The current deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first two years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high-speed broadband within the next four years. NBI has made steady progress to date, with design work complete or ongoing in target townlands across 20 counties, including Leitrim, with over 91,000 premises surveyed to date. This survey work is feeding into detailed designs for each deployment area. Laying fibre should start shortly, with the first fibre-to-home connection expected around December 2020 in Carrigaline, County Cork. NBI provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register an interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website,  Broadband connection points, BCPs, are a key element of the NBP, providing high-speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll-out of the fibre-to-home network. Approximately 300 sites in rural areas were identified for connection by the end of 2020, including 75 schools. Over 100 broadband connection point sites have been installed by NBI and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools. Four schools and four BCPs within the areas referred to by the Deputy have been installed by NBI to date, with a further two BCPs scheduled to be installed in September followed by another eight by the end of the year. I understand that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment continues to work with the Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP. While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact as far as possible. The Covid-19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities.This is reflected in the commitments in the programme for Government where the delivery of the national broadband plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged, particularly around increased levels of remote working. The programme for Government commits to seeking the accelerated roll-out of the national broadband plan and in this regard my Department continues to engage with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this roll-out to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises currently scheduled in years six and seven of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network roll-out is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19. Bringing connectivity to rural Ireland is central to promoting regional development and the broadband connection points are an important part of that process.	spk_273
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-09-16	dail	33	Flood Relief Schemes	dbsect_13	I will pass on those questions to the Minister, Deputy Ryan. We all understand the importance of the roll-out of broadband throughout the country and I understand the Deputy's frustration. We have all felt similar frustration in our constituencies over the years and we know this Government knows the importance of rolling out the broadband plan. The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of good and reliable broadband to ensure citizens right across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the programme for Government, where delivery of the national broadband plan will be a key enabler of many of the policies envisaged, particularly around increased levels of remote working.

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-09-16	dail	33	Flood Relief Schemes	dbsect_13	I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue. The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on these roads are funded from the councils' own resources, supplemented by State road grants. I thank the Deputy for his clear outlining of the issues relating to the devastating impact of weather conditions in County Cork in August. Unfortunately, such severe weather events are becoming more frequent and highlight the need to focus on measures needed to address climate change. As part of the recent Government stimulus package, eligible councils were asked to submit proposals to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport under the heading of climate change adaptation repairs by 14 August 2020. Cork County Council submitted proposals for 2020 which amounted to €1.63 million and on 31 August received notification that works to the value of €1.63 million had been approved. As the council's application for funding was received in mid-August, some but not all of the recent damage to roads and bridges caused by severe weather in County Cork is provided for in the August allocation. In that context, as the Deputy outlined, the chief executive of the council wrote to the Department, detailing the severity of the conditions experienced, particularly in west Cork, and requesting funding support from the Department for repairs to the regional and local network. Cork County Council has received its funding allocation under the stimulus package. The Deputy inquired whether the stimulus funding could be rolled over into 2021 to cover repair costs but, as the July stimulus is intended for projects which can be delivered this year, it is not possible for allocations to carry over into 2021. The Department has been engaging with the council about the repairs needed to the regional and local network and will be liaising further about the programme and the timing of the works. In that context, the council has been asked to provide a breakdown of the proposed 2020 and 2021 expenditure. I make the point that local authorities have the flexibility to revise their grant-funded work programmes in response to severe weather events. On the works which will run into 2021, the Department's ability to provide specific funding for the repair and rehabilitation of roads in west Cork following the recent flood events is dependent on the funding made available for roads as part of the overall Estimates process. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, will be liaising with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, on this issue. As regards national roads, under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of roads. In this role, TII undertakes maintenance and renewal of roads assets either directly through its contractors or through local authority programmes funded by TII. It has liaised with local authorities regarding damage caused to pavements and structures in counties affected by recent severe weather and funding is being provided for remedial works to be undertaken. Moreover, special inspections will be undertaken at affected bridges in order to ascertain that no structural damage has been caused to those bridge structures.	spk_283

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-09-09	dail	33	Aviation Policy	dbsect_24	I thank all the Deputies for raising this important issue. I am acutely aware that, as an island nation, Ireland is particularly dependent on air connectivity both socially and economically, and aviation plays a critical role in our economy. However, due to coronavirus, global civil aviation is currently experiencing its most challenging crisis, more severe than what happened after the attacks on 11 September 2001 or the global financial crash, with many analysts predicting that it will take several years for the sector to return to 2019 levels. Irish aviation stakeholders are fully exposed to the resulting dramatic downturn in activity and it is clear that should Covid-19's impact on aviation be prolonged, this will affect their long-term financial health. I have met all key aviation stakeholders and officials have ongoing engagement with airports and airlines. I am particularly concerned by a recent announcement by Ryanair of the possible closure of its bases at Shannon and Cork, and also media reports that Aer Lingus might relocate aircraft from its base at Shannon. These are commercial decisions of the companies concerned and it should be noted that route schedules for the winter season at Shannon and Cork have not yet been finalised. In order to assist businesses and further protect employment, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of generalised supports for companies of all sizes, including those in the aviation sector, which includes a wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, a waiver of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. Liquidity funding is also available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund. The existing support mechanisms available for the aviation sector will be reviewed in the context of the Government's plans for international travel. In line with priorities for regional development, the Government is also maintaining subvention for air services to the regions. Approximately €2.5 million in Exchequer funding is being provided for capital investment in the areas of safety and security for Donegal, Ireland West and Kerry airports. A new regional airports programme for 2020 to 2024 is being prepared, incorporating a number of support schemes for our regional airports. Shannon Airport has been provided with an emergency grant of over €6 million to complete its hold baggage screening project, a safety and security requirement under EU regulations. Legislation has been introduced to provide a State guarantee for refund credit notes issued to consumers of Irish licensed travel agents and tour operators who have had to cancel holiday bookings. This guarantee ensures that where a credit note is accepted by a consumer, its monetary value is secured until it is used in the future. These supports notwithstanding, our airlines and other aviation stakeholders have had to make a number of difficult decisions in order to best ensure their long-term commercial viability. These decisions have focused on areas such as redundancies, laying off staff and the potential closure of operational bases, all in response to the significant reduction in their operations. Industry has also introduced shorter working schemes, which have reduced both hours worked and levels of pay received by their staff. The aviation recovery task force set out recommendations for consideration by Ministers and the Government on what needs to be done to assist the Irish aviation sector to recover from the Covid-19 crisis. The task force report contains a number of recommendations on how to support Irish aviation, which has been badly affected by the almost complete shutdown of international air travel. The recommendations include measures to sustain the industry for as long as travel restrictions are in place and also measures to help stimulate a return to growth, when the time is right. The Government has already implemented several recommendations, including the publication of safe air travel protocols. We have progressed a European slot rule waiver for airlines in consultation with the European Commission. The wage subsidy scheme was extended to April 2021.The other recommendations, including further targeted financial supports to help reinstate connectivity, are being examined by Government. Work is required to develop these recommendations into effective interventions and that work is under way. This will feed into the Government's further plans to aid the broader economic recovery, including in the aviation sector. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I just wanted to get my reply in.	spk_200
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-09-09	dail	33	Aviation Policy	dbsect_24	I will be brief and try to keep to the time allotted. I have engaged with travel agents and have written to the Tánaiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding supports for them. With regard to Aer Lingus workers, the Deputies can be assured that protecting jobs and employment is a key priority for the Government. To answer some of the Deputies' other queries, the Government is acting on public health advice and has adopted a very cautious approach to international travel. It is currently finalising a new medium-term roadmap for living with Covid which will include its approach to international travel. The Cabinet sub-committee on Covid is meeting tomorrow. It is envisaged that plans for international air travel will be considered. We need to explore whether the introduction of Covid testing in the context of international travel can provide an alternative to the restrictions and allow for the reopening of international travel. The Government will discuss that medium-term plan at the Cabinet meeting next Tuesday and it will be published shortly thereafter.  The Deputies can be assured that a great amount of work is happening across Government, led by the Taoiseach's office. Different Government Departments are feeding into this work. My own Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is feeding in with regard to international travel. I have already highlighted the importance of connectivity, including regional connectivity, for our island and the importance of protecting jobs while, at the same time, ensuring that public health is safeguarded.  I thank the Deputies for raising this issue. I know it is a real concern for all of them and for the workers in their constituencies. We are here to try to protect jobs and to ensure connectivity, while remaining highly aware of the need to protect our citizens and public health.	spk_207
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-09-09	dail	33	Aviation Policy	dbsect_28	I thank all the Deputies for raising this important issue. I am acutely aware that, as an island nation, Ireland is particularly dependent on air connectivity both socially and economically, and aviation plays a critical role in our economy. However, due to coronavirus, global civil aviation is currently experiencing its most challenging crisis, more severe than what happened after the attacks on 11 September 2001 or the global financial crash, with many analysts predicting that it will take several years for the sector to return to 2019 levels. Irish aviation stakeholders are fully exposed to the resulting dramatic downturn in activity and it is clear that should Covid-19's impact on aviation be prolonged, this will affect their long-term financial health. I have met all key aviation stakeholders and officials have ongoing engagement with airports and airlines. I am particularly concerned by a recent announcement by Ryanair of the possible closure of its bases at Shannon and Cork, and also media reports that Aer Lingus might relocate aircraft from its base at Shannon. These are commercial decisions of the companies concerned and it should be noted that route schedules for the winter season at Shannon and Cork have not yet been finalised. In order to assist businesses and further protect employment, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of generalised supports for companies of all sizes, including those in the aviation sector, which includes a wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, a waiver of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. Liquidity funding is also available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund. The existing support mechanisms available for the aviation sector will be reviewed in the context of the Government's plans for international travel. In line with priorities for regional development, the Government is also maintaining subvention for air services to the regions. Approximately €2.5 million in Exchequer funding is being provided for capital investment in the areas of safety and security for Donegal, Ireland West and Kerry airports. A new regional airports programme for 2020 to 2024 is being prepared, incorporating a number of support schemes for our regional airports. Shannon Airport has been provided with an emergency grant of over €6 million to complete its hold baggage screening project, a safety and security requirement under EU regulations. Legislation has been introduced to provide a State guarantee for refund credit notes issued to consumers of Irish licensed travel agents and tour operators who have had to cancel holiday bookings. This guarantee ensures that where a credit note is accepted by a consumer, its monetary value is secured until it is used in the future. These supports notwithstanding, our airlines and other aviation stakeholders have had to make a number of difficult decisions in order to best ensure their long-term commercial viability. These decisions have focused on areas such as redundancies, laying off staff and the potential closure of operational bases, all in response to the significant reduction in their operations. Industry has also introduced shorter working schemes, which have reduced both hours worked and levels of pay received by their staff. The aviation recovery task force set out recommendations for consideration by Ministers and the Government on what needs to be done to assist the Irish aviation sector to recover from the Covid-19 crisis.

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-07-28	dail	33	Ports Development	dbsect_51	I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter. The National Driver Licence Service is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority and is provided under contract. The NDLS processes applications for learner permits and driver licences. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the provision of services, as the Deputy has outlined. As a result, a number of services ceased, including the national car testing service and driver testing, theory tests, and driver licence applications and renewals. The NDLS offices closed at the end of March 2020 due to the pandemic. Emergency regulations were brought in to provide for an extension of four months to the validity of driver licences and learner permits that expired between 1 March and 30 June 2020. This meant that a driver licence that expired on 20 March would not need to be renewed until 20 July. Similarly, a licence that expired on 15 July would not need to be renewed until 15 November. In order to deal with the difficulties that arose due to the Covid-19 pandemic and to ensure consistency across EU member states, the European Commission eventually introduced a regulation in July 2020 to provide for an extension of seven months to the validity of driving licences that expired or would expire from 1 February to 31 August 2020. Member states could opt out of the regulation if they had already provided nationally for an extension. Ireland opted out under this provision as an extension of four months had already been granted in April up to the end of June and the RSA wanted to resume services as soon as possible. Learner permits, however, were further extended for an additional four months to the end of October. The reason for this extension was to ease the pressure on the NDLS to allow the prioritising of issuing of driver licences. It should be noted that learner permits are provided under national law while driver licences come under EU law. There was no oversight in not extending driver licences at that time. The possibility of a further extension to the validity of driver licences along with that of learner permits was discussed with the RSA, but the authority believed, on the basis of its expectations at that point in time, that this would not be necessary. It is only fair to the authority to acknowledge that the Covid-19 crisis is an unprecedented and fluid set of circumstances in which it is difficult to be certain about future developments. While the reopened NDLS offices and the future expansion of online licence renewal options will eventually enable the RSA to clear the backlog, it is now clear that this will not happen quickly enough to facilitate the urgent needs of all applicants. The NDLS resumed services on a phased basis on Monday, 8 June 2020. All centres have reopened nationwide with the exception of part-time NDLS offices in Belmullet and Clifden, which are expected to reopen shortly. However, the NDLS is now operating at about 60% of its pre-Covid capacity. All appointments must be booked in advance and walk-in appointments are no longer available to ensure social distancing and compliance with occupational and public health requirements. It will naturally take some time for services to return to normal and, unfortunately, there are delays in acquiring appointments. Since July the RSA has been working with its service providers to see how it can increase capacity while adhering to the return-to-work protocol. Options include extended opening hours, increasing the number of cases dealt with monthly, overtime and protective segregation barriers between booths. Having monitored the situation closely, it is now clear that the backlog cannot be dealt with in a timely manner while operating at 60% capacity and with an extended online system not yet in operation. Having considered the matter, I believe a further extension of driver licences in now appropriate. An extension to driver licences is not possible without consent from the European Commission, in order to be compliant with EU law. My officials have now applied to the European Commission to seek agreement to a further extension for driver licences to ease the pressure on services.	spk_506
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-07-28	dail	33	Ports Development	dbsect_51	I thank the Deputy. I agree the number of people waiting for appointments is at an unacceptably high level. I believe a further extension of the licences is the correct approach to deal with the issue. The extension is subject to EU approval and my officials have contacted the EU in that regard. We will also be prioritising work on the legislation required to get the online system up and running, which will also help to alleviate the pressure. I do not know the length of the extension. We will have to wait for the European Commission's response on that. My officials have applied to the European Commission to seek agreement to a further extension and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, will give priority to urgent cases if contacted by individuals outlining the details.  The RSA contacted the Department today to state that pending the extension of the online system, it cannot make significant inroads into dealing with the backlog and it has asked that consideration be given to a further extension of the driving licences to ease those pressures. The Deputy can be assured getting this extension is a priority for me and my Department.	spk_508
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-07-28	dail	33	Ports Development	dbsect_51	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Rosslare Europort continues to work closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and other Government Departments and offices in preparing for the border controls and other impacts that will arise from Brexit. The port's border inspection post, on a 16 acre site 1 km from the port, is ready for operation and additional staff have been deployed at Rosslare Europort since April 2020. Future Brexit configuration has been incorporated into the overall master plan for the port.  Rosslare Europort is actively seeking opportunities arising from Brexit to expand shipping services to continental EU ports, and I am aware that the Deputy, together with other representatives from the Irish Road Haulage Association, as well as representatives from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and from Rosslare Europort, visited northern France in November 2019 to try to develop shipping links from Rosslare. I thank the Deputy for her work on developing such links. Since that time, Brittany Ferries has launched a new service to Roscoff and to Bilbao from Rosslare. Rosslare is unique among the State's commercial ports as it operates outside of the Harbours Acts 1996 to 2009.  The port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbour Company which owes its origins to the Fishguard Bay Railway and Pier Act 1893. The constituent ports of the company are nowadays the operational and financial responsibility of larnród Éireann and Stena Line Ports Limited, respectively. On account of this historic arrangement, Rosslare Europort is operated as a division of larnród Éireann. Rosslare is the fourth largest port in the State in terms of overall tonnage handled, and the State's second largest passenger port. The port generates revenue of more than €10 million per annum, with surpluses of approximately €2.5 million. Rosslare is targeting growth and new business opportunities and has received the approval of the larnród Éireann board for a strategic plan to grow the port's business.  This includes plans for investment of about €30 million in customer facilities, port infrastructure, assets and new technology. Earlier this year, Brittany Ferries began operating between Rosslare and Roscoff and Bilbao.  Rosslare has a significant proportion of Irish roll-on roll-off traffic at approximately 16%. Due to this, in preparation for Brexit, Rosslare has now been designated as an approved EU border control post and the Office of Public Works, OPW, is working with the various State agencies to put in place the necessary port facilities and infrastructure. On offshore wind, in recent weeks the Dutch logistics company, XELLZ, has selected the port of Rosslare as its offshore wind supply base and has acquired private land around the port. It is early days but the company aims to tap into upcoming Irish offshore wind opportunities. Rosslare Europort is on the Trans-European Transport Network, TEN-T, comprehensive network but it does not meet the EU criteria for TEN-T core port status. However, Rosslare Europort continues to be eligible for EU co-funding under the Connecting Europe Facility. This co-funding is available to projects on both the comprehensive and the core parts of the TEN-T network, subject to such projects satisfying the eligibility criteria of a given call for proposals, and being selected in the evaluation process. The programme for Government commits the Government to continue to work closely with Rosslare Europort to ensure it is ready for all Brexit scenarios. The Government has underlined the importance of the UK land bridge with the European Commission negotiating team and we will continue to engage with our partners in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany to ensure the land bridge remains a viable and efficient route to market. This is important for Rosslare. The programme for Government incudes a commitment to ensuring that systems at Rosslare Europort are Brexit ready and adapted to take account of Covid-19 at the end of the transition period. We will ensure this is the case and that Rosslare Europort can continue to play its full role as a critical part of Ireland's economic and social infrastructure.	spk_510
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-07-28	dail	33	Ports Development	dbsect_51	In regard to the free zone, Rosslare Europort is seeking the creation of such a zone at the port to facilitate and encourage the development of businesses. The port has been engaging with Wexford County Council on this matter. Among the business opportunities the port wishes to pursue in the context of a free zone is the creation of a facility to service the growing offshore wind industry. Free zones are secured customs areas within the European Union where non-Union goods can be introduced free of import duties and charges and commercial policy measures. These goods may, following time in the free zone, be released to the domestic market subject to payment of import duties and other charges. Rosslare Europort envisages that companies which locate in the port's business park free zone would have the ability to operate and install offshore wind farms in a cost-effective and competitive manner. My understanding is that the proposal for a free zone at Rosslare is at a very early concept stage and a full business proposal would need to be developed and examined by the Departments concerned, including the Department of Finance, the new Department with responsibility for enterprise and the new Department with responsibility for transport, and compliance with EU state aid rules would be required. In the meantime, Rosslare Europort is to undergo a major transformation as part of its master plan, which will see more than €30 million invested in customer facilities, port infrastructure, assets and new technology by the port over the course of the next five years. This will entail the modernisation and digitalisation of the port. The Deputy referred to the TEN-T process. The European Commission has published a methodology for establishing the core and comprehensive layers of the TEN-T network. Rosslare Europort is on the TEN-T comprehensive network, as I have outlined, and it does not meet the threshold for TEN-T core port status. I have run out of time but I can discuss these issues further with the Deputy at a later date.	spk_512

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-07-23	dail	33	Football Association of Ireland	dbsect_46	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I wish to explain that, once funding arrangements have been put in place through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, the planning, design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Overall, TII is responsible for the delivery of the national roads programme in accordance with Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan, NDP. In that context, TII provides the Department with regular updates on its delivery of the national roads programme. Within the timeframe given in the lead up to this debate, the following is the most up-to-date information available to me. Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the national planning framework, which provides the strategic and financial framework for the national roads programme for the period 2018 to 2027. The focus of TII's activities in the coming years is accordingly being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes included in the NDP along with the maintenance of the existing national road network. While it is not clear what specific road project the Deputy is referring to - I will refer to Celbridge at the end - the inner and outer relief roads for Maynooth, Leixlip and Naas in County Kildare are not included among those projects that have been identified for development in the area during the period of the NDP. The M4 and M7 roads already bypass the Maynooth, Leixlip and Naas urban areas. It should be noted that, consistent with the programme for Government, a review of the NDP is proposed, taking account of the Government's priorities set out in the programme. I also wish to take this opportunity to highlight that all projects, including those listed in the NDP or any proposed revision to the plan, require statutory approval and compliance with the public spending code. I will highlight the following projects that are being progressed and completed for the Kildare region. I understand from TII that work is under way on the M4 Maynooth to Leixlip transportation corridor. Technical advisers were appointed in December 2019 and are working on early stage appraisal and option considerations for the scheme. In parallel, Kildare County Council is progressing a feasibility study on the possibility of advancing a bus corridor on this section of the national route, which will be considered as part of the overall solution. I understand from TII that €1 million has been allocated to the Kildare national roads office, which is working on behalf of Kildare and South Dublin county councils, to progress and complete this study. Once funding has been assigned to TII, individual payments to local authorities are a matter for TII. It may be contacted directly for further details on this matter. In addition, a brief was developed by Kildare County Council to examine the feasibility of short-term bus priority measures on this route. I understand that there is ongoing co-ordination with the National Transport Authority, NTA, on the public transportation initiatives associated with the delivery of this project. The M7 Naas-Newbridge bypass upgrade scheme is substantially complete. It involves the widening of the M7 motorway from a two-lane into a three-lane carriageway in each direction. It also includes the removal of the existing on-off access ramps at junction 10 at Naas south and the construction of a new interchange immediately south of the existing junction 10. Some final finishing works and snagging of defects arising from the road safety audit are ongoing. The road was opened to traffic in August 2019. Regarding Celbridge, my understanding is that there is no national road planned there and that it is probably a local or regional roads issue. I will revert to my officials and provide the Deputy with an update on the matter. I will work with him on it.	spk_328
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-07-23	dail	33	Football Association of Ireland	dbsect_46	I will explain how national roads projects are identified for development. The NDP identifies two categories of national road improvements. The first includes projects to advance to construction, subject to satisfactory outcomes of the project appraisal and development consent approval processes. The second includes projects at pre-appraisal and early planning stages that are being assessed with a view to developing a pipeline of suitable projects for development. Specific inner and outer relief roads in Maynooth, Leixlip and Naas are not currently within the scope of the NDP.I would also like to explain the approvals requirement associated with national roads projects generally. In line with the requirement of the public spending code and the Department's capital appraisal framework for transport projects and programmes and also planning approvals, two sets of approvals are required in regard to any proposed schemes: approval of the business case and cost-benefit analysis for the project and approval by An Bord Pleanála of an application for development consent. The necessity to meet the requirements of the public spending code and planning consent from An Bord Pleanála, along with an adequate capital budget, are critical to delivering any national road project. All projects under the national development plan or any proposed projects outside of the scope of the national development plan will require all of the approvals that I have outlined. This will also include Government approval in cases where projects are estimated to be above €100 million. The M4 Maynooth to Leixlip transportation corridor is at a very early stage of development and it is not, therefore, possible at this time to indicate the timeframe for the construction of the project, if it is deemed feasible to proceed. However, as I have just outlined, any timeframe is dependent on obtaining the necessary consents at various critical stages, including at the route selection, detailed design and tender stages. Typically, schemes of this size can take of the order of eight to 13 years to advance from the initial proposal to completion of construction.	spk_330
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-07-23	dail	33	Football Association of Ireland	dbsect_46	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Further to the comprehensive statement provided by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, last Thursday on the memorandum of understanding with the FAI, I am pleased to provide additional information in response to the Deputy's query. At its meeting on 30 January the Government authorised the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, to enter an agreement with the FAI to provide additional funding support to the association to address its grave financial crisis. This additional funding would be conditional on the FAI implementing reforms to its corporate governance and financial controls on an agreed timeframe. The MOU signed on 30 January by the then Minister, Shane Ross, and the chairperson of the FAI, Mr. Roy Barrett, enables Sport Ireland to restore funding to the FAI of €2.9 million per annum and to provide additional annual funding of €2.9 million for football development up to 2023. It also provides for a repayable grant of just over €7.6 million to the FAI to pay its licence fee for the Aviva Stadium up to 2022. The MOU sets out broadly the terms upon which funding support can be provided and is to be underpinned by a series of relevant documents which will set out in detail the terms under which funding will be provided. It was agreed that in line with the established grant for sporting bodies, Sport Ireland would oversee the disbursement of funding to the FAI and would enter relevant legal agreements with the association in this regard. In April, a memorandum of agreement was entered into between Sport Ireland, the FAI and New Stadium DAC, the company which operates the Aviva Stadium, for the disbursement of the FAI's licence fee to New Stadium DAC. The agreement outlines that a recoupable grant will be paid in instalments totalling €2,544,600 annually by Sport Ireland directly to New Stadium DAC on behalf of the FAI in each of the years 2020 to 2022. This grant will be recoupable from the FAI from 2024.  Sport Ireland is awaiting confirmation of the implementation of various reforms by the FAI before putting an agreement in place in relation to the remaining funding approved by the Government. At its most recent meeting on Friday, 17 July, the board of Sport Ireland considered the immediate steps necessary towards restoration of funding to the FAI. The board recognised and endorsed recent progress made by the FAI to improve its governance and internal control environment. The board also agreed that the relevant rule and constitutional changes committed to by the FAI are required to be implemented in line with the MOU prior to grant funding being paid. As the Minister, Deputy Ryan, informed the House last week, the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the then Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Calleary, confirmed to the FAI on 9 July that the Government would not reopen for discussion any part of the MOU agreed by the previous Government.	spk_332
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-07-23	dail	33	Football Association of Ireland	dbsect_46	A nominations committee was formed by the FAI to appoint independent directors to the board of the FAI in line with one of the key recommendations of the governance review group report. Sport Ireland was invited by the FAI to nominate two independent persons to the committee. Its nominees were Olive Loughnane and Peter McLoone. Amrop, a world-leading executive-search firm, was appointed as the search partner to assist with the selection of independent directors. The then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, and his Department had no role in the nomination of the committee or the selection of the independent directors. On 8 January, the FAI announced the appointment of three independent directors to the board. Roy Barrett was appointed as the independent chairperson, Catherine Guy and Liz Joyce as independent directors, while Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was appointed by the FAI as the fourth independent director on its board on Tuesday, 21 July. That appointment was made by the FAI in accordance with the association's rule book, memorandum and articles of association. Neither the Minister who now has responsibility for sport, nor the former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, nor their Departments had any role in the appointment. The FAI announced on 4 July that its AGM has been moved to September and that an extraordinary general meeting, EGM, will take place in the near future to vote on the required changes to the FAI rule book and constitution as the association pushes on with governance reform. While the FAI has not yet announced a date for the EGM, Sport Ireland understands it is most likely to be held in the second week of August. Sport Ireland has not paid out any funding to the FAI in 2020 and no Sport Ireland funding is scheduled to be paid in advance of the FAI's EGM.	spk_336
Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-07-23	dail	33	Road Improvement Schemes	dbsect_49	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I wish to explain that, once funding arrangements have been put in place through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, the planning, design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Overall, TII is responsible for the delivery of the national roads programme in accordance with Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan, NDP. In that context, TII provides the Department with regular updates on its delivery of the national roads programme. Within the timeframe given in the lead up to this debate, the following is the most up-to-date information available to me. Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the national planning framework, which provides the strategic and financial framework for the national roads programme for the period 2018 to 2027. The focus of TII's activities in the coming years is accordingly being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes included in the NDP along with the maintenance of the existing national road network. While it is not clear what specific road project the Deputy is referring to - I will refer to Celbridge at the end - the inner and outer relief roads for Maynooth, Leixlip and Naas in County Kildare are not included among those projects that have been identified for development in the area during the period of the NDP. The M4 and M7 roads already bypass the Maynooth, Leixlip and Naas urban areas. It should be noted that, consistent with the programme for Government, a review of the NDP is proposed, taking account of the Government's priorities set out in the programme. I also wish to take this opportunity to highlight that all projects, including those listed in the NDP or any proposed revision to the plan, require statutory approval and compliance with the public spending code. I will highlight the following projects that are being progressed and completed for the Kildare region. I understand from TII that work is under way on the M4 Maynooth to Leixlip transportation corridor.

As set out in the programme for Government, the Government will be carrying out a review of the national development plan later this year, taking account of the priorities of Government set out in the programme. The proposed N72-N73 Mallow relief road project is included among a number of major national road schemes that were identified in the national development plan for planning, design and construction. This scheme consists of a single or dual carriageway bypass of the town of Mallow. The scheme length would be of the order of 4.5 km to 7 km. The pre-appraisal plan for the Mallow relief road was approved by the economic unit of the Department. Following this, the procurement process for the appointment of technical advisors to progress the first four stages of TII’s project management guidelines was completed. Early planning, design and appraisal work for the project has commenced. Cork County Council and its advisors are currently assessing all route options available given the constraints. The relief road project would provide numerous benefits. It would bypass Mallow, reducing congestion and improving the environment of the town. It would cater for strategic traffic. It would improve access to and from Mallow. It would bring economic improvements for the Munster region. It would provide cycle and walking facilities for non-motorised users. The scheme is at an early stage of development and, therefore, it is not possible at this time to indicate a likely timeframe for construction of the project. The timeframe for delivery of any major or minor works or projects that require statutory approval, whether for environmental impact assessment or compulsory purchase orders or both, is between eight and 13 years.

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-07-14	dail	33	Credit Unions	dbsect_35	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. The Marine Casualty Investigation Board was established as an independent body in 2002 under the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 to investigate marine casualties and publish reports of such investigations involving Irish-registered vessels worldwide and other vessels in Irish territorial waters and inland waterways. Section 8 of the Act provides that the board shall be independent of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in the performance of its functions and in general shall be independent of any other person or body whose interests could conflict with the functions of the board. Section 9 sets out the composition of the five-person board, which consists of three persons appointed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the chief surveyor of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Secretary General of the Department or his or her nominee. Under current arrangements, the three ministerial appointments are made following an open application process involving the Public Appointments Service, PAS, State boards recruitment system. The 2000 Act set out a specific legislative framework for the operation of the board and also addressed such issues as tenure of office, removal from office, disclosure of interests, the reporting of marine casualties and investigations. All investigations of marine casualties are carried out by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board's panel of external investigators. The panel reflects the broad-based marine competence and experience which is of relevance in undertaking independent investigations. Directive 2009/18/EC of 23 April 2009 establishes the fundamental principles governing the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector. The directive applies to a small subset of the marine casualties that come under the remit of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, and involves an average of fewer than three casualties in any given year. Article 8.1 of the directive provides that an investigation of body shall be independent in its organisation, legal structure and decision making of any party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to it.  In 2011, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board was designated as the investigative body in the State for the purposes of Article 8 of the directive. The EU Commission expressed concern at the independence of the board in the context of the independence requirements of Article 8.1, with particular regard to the membership of the chief surveyor of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the nominee of the Secretary General of the Department of the board. The case was lodged with the Court of Justice of the European Union in March 2019. On 9 July 2020, the court delivered its judgment, declaring that by failing to provide for an investigative body which is independent in its organisation and decision-making of any party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to that investigative body, Ireland has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 8.1 of the directive. The main issue of concern is the presence of two departmental officials on the board who were seen as persons whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to the board. There is no finding of impartiality on the part of the board, but the court has noted that a finding that the investigative body failed to act impartially in specific cases is not necessary to establish an infringement. My Department is examining the judgment and has sought urgent legal advice on the possible next steps, which may involve amending legislation to provide a basis for early engagement with the EU Commission and to ensure that the court's findings and the concerns of the Commission are addressed. At this early stage, I am not in a position to indicate definitively what our next course of action will be. However, I can assure Deputies that every effort will be made to progress matters as quickly as possible in order to enhance the organisational independence of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board in carrying out its important role in investigating marine casualties, establishing the cause or causes of those casualties and making safety recommendations for the avoidance of similar incidents in the future.	spk_292

The directive applies to a small subset of the marine casualties that come under the remit of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, and involves an average of fewer than three casualties in any given year. Article 8.1 of the directive provides that an investigation of body shall be independent in its organisation, legal structure and decision making of any party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to it.  In 2011, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board was designated as the investigative body in the State for the purposes of Article 8 of the directive. The EU Commission expressed concern at the independence of the board in the context of the independence requirements of Article 8.1, with particular regard to the membership of the chief surveyor of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the nominee of the Secretary General of the Department of the board. The case was lodged with the Court of Justice of the European Union in March 2019. On 9 July 2020, the court delivered its judgment, declaring that by failing to provide for an investigative body which is independent in its organisation and decision-making of any party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to that investigative body, Ireland has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 8.1 of the directive. The main issue of concern is the presence of two departmental officials on the board who were seen as persons whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to the board. There is no finding of impartiality on the part of the board, but the court has noted that a finding that the investigative body failed to act impartially in specific cases is not necessary to establish an infringement. My Department is examining the judgment and has sought urgent legal advice on the possible next steps, which may involve amending legislation to provide a basis for early engagement with the EU Commission and to ensure that the court's findings and the concerns of the Commission are addressed. At this early stage, I am not in a position to indicate definitively what our next course of action will be. However, I can assure Deputies that every effort will be made to progress matters as quickly as possible in order to enhance the organisational independence of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board in carrying out its important role in investigating marine casualties, establishing the cause or causes of those casualties and making safety recommendations for the avoidance of similar incidents in the future.	spk_292

Hildegarde Naughton	49	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2020-07-08	dail	33	Special Areas of Conservation	dbsect_10	I thank the Deputies for raising this very important matter with me. As an island nation, Ireland is particularly dependent, both socially and economically, on air connectivity. Aviation plays a critical role in our economy. More than 140,000 jobs are supported by the air transport sector in Ireland. The air transport industry, including airlines and industry supply chains, is estimated to support a share of Ireland's GDP worth €8.9 billion. Approximately 6.8% of GDP was supported by air transport and foreign tourists arriving by air in 2018. Spending by foreign tourists supports a further €8.7 billion of the country's GDP. Ireland is also a significant global player in the area of aircraft leasing, an industry which contributes a further €541 million to the economy and supports almost 5,000 jobs. Successive Government policies and the national aviation policy have recognised and supported this contribution. They have pointed in particular to Ireland's reliance on international connectivity to secure its competitive international position. The current policy has been highly successful and aviation in Ireland has seen strong growth in recent years. However, as we all know, the Covid-19 crisis is having a significant impact on the sector. Irish airports and airlines are fully exposed to the dramatic downturn in activity. Operations shrank to a small fraction of the normal level of activity, resulting in significant cash flow problems. Airlines and airports have had to restructure their businesses significantly in response to the crisis, and many are availing of Government supports. The Shannon Group has been severely impacted by Covid-19. I acknowledge and thank the company's management and staff for their commitment to keeping the airport open and keeping passengers and staff safe during this very difficult time. We can all agree on the importance of Shannon Airport to Ireland and to the mid-west in particular. This is acknowledged in the national aviation policy, which recognises the strategic importance of Shannon to the connectivity of the mid-west and its importance as a gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way. Unfortunately, in the challenging circumstances faced by the Shannon Group, management have had to take difficult decisions to ensure the future viability of the company. I understand the company has been engaging further with employees this week on further measures that must be taken to assist the company's recovery. I do not underestimate the impact on employees of these changes, which are deemed necessary to enable the Shannon Group to secure the future of the airport so that it will be well placed when the sector recovers from this crisis. Deputies will be aware that in response to Covid-19, the Government has put a broad range of supports in place to help mitigate the effects of the crisis. These include the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, of which many companies in the aviation sector, including the Shannon Group, are availing. The Shannon Group has asked for a range of supports from the Government to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19. These are being considered. My Department recently approved €6.1 million of emergency funding to complete the airport's hold baggage screening project. The Department continues to work closely with the Shannon Group to ensure that the company, including Shannon Airport, will be well positioned operationally to contribute to the post-pandemic economic and social recovery. The impact of Covid-19 on the aviation sector has been severe. The sector will continue to be impacted as long as international air travel is restricted on public health grounds. The Government is acutely aware of the matter and suitable policy and financial responses are being developed. The final report of the aviation recovery task force will be important when finalising proposals, given the expertise and industry insights it will reflect.	spk_169

For the first time in Ireland we have, through the Government's climate action plan, a structured pathway towards meeting our climate change targets out to 2030 and beyond. This plan was heavily influenced by the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which I chair. We now have a comprehensive and credible plan that will be updated annually. I urge everyone in this Chamber to work together, as the joint committee will continue to do, to realise the climate action laws and policies that will help Ireland to reduce its emissions in line with its international commitments. In particular, I encourage the House to fast-track the climate action Bill, which will introduce the groundbreaking governance changes recommended by the joint committee, such as the establishment of the standing committee that will ensure accountability of the Government to the Oireachtas on climate action and an enhanced, independent climate action council to recommend five-year carbon budgets and identify a pathway for our emissions reduction targets out to 2030 and beyond. I also encourage colleagues to attach priority to the marine planning and development management Bill, which is due to come before the House shortly. It will streamline the consent regime for offshore generation. We have enormous and thus far largely untapped potential for renewable energy off our coast and we need to move quickly to capitalise on this. To decarbonise our electricity sector, the climate action plan has a target of having 70% of our electricity come from renewables by 2030. Achieving this would enable us to capitalise on the significant job opportunities for coastal communities and the international investment that a vibrant offshore sector would bring, in addition to improved security of supply. Crucially, it would enable us to decarbonise our economy and reduce emissions. I look forward to engaging positively with my colleagues on the joint committee and with Members of this House.	spk_449

Hildegarde Naughton	48	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2019-05-09	dail	32	Report entitled 'Climate Change: A Cross-Party Consensus on Climate Action': Motion	dbsect_32	I thank the Minister for his very positive comments and his emphasis on the need for urgency on this issue. The report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, responding to the Citizen's Assembly report on climate change, was formally launched on 16 April 2019. This report marks the beginning of a new era for climate policy in Ireland. The report represents all-party consensus on many of the tough and ambitious actions the Government must take to address its international climate commitments and go beyond that to become a leader in tackling climate change globally. We as an Oireachtas have shown leadership, bringing all political groupings together to reach strong cross-party support for the practical recommendations outlined in our report. There have been calls for this type of good practice on climate policy to be replicated across Europe. We know the science around climate change is becoming increasingly urgent. The special report by the Intergovernmental Conference on Climate Change, IPCC, on global warming of 1.5° Celsius was the starkest warning yet that we are running out of time to address runaway climate change. In Ireland we are beginning to see some of the initial effects of climate change through extreme weather events, such as flooding, affecting our homes, farms and businesses. Our citizens and, in particular, our young people are mobilising to demand stronger climate action to secure their future. Our Citizen's Assembly was clear in its call for Ireland to do more to address this existential threat. In establishing the joint committee to look at the recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly and in producing our detailed report for action, the Oireachtas has shown that we are listening to Irish citizens, that we take climate change extremely seriously and that we must take strong and immediate action to address it.  I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the great work of the Joint Committee on Climate Action over the last seven months. I commend my committee colleagues, across all political groupings, for their commitment to this process. I express my thanks to Deputies Butler, Corcoran-Kennedy, Pringle, Eamon Ryan, Sherlock, Bríd Smith, Stanley, Deering, Dooley, Heydon, Lahart, Munster, Jack Chambers, Neville and Nolan and to Senators Paul Daly, Devine, Lombard, Marshall and Grace O'Sullivan. Parties should be proud of reaching a strong consensus position on many of the tough actions the Government must take for Ireland to play its part in fairly addressing climate change globally.  The committee's report provides a clear mandate for actions the Government must take to address Ireland's international climate change obligations. It is large and particularly detailed for an Oireachtas report, containing more than 40 priority recommendations for Government and State agencies. It addresses actions across all relevant sectors and proposes a new governance framework for climate policy that will pave the way for more transformational changes in individual sectors. It also covers cross-cutting themes such as incentivising climate action, just transition, citizen engagement and education and communication. The report further highlights the opportunities for Ireland, recognising that there will be new green industries, new jobs and new export opportunities as we transition to a low-carbon economy.  We have tried to make the report accessible to citizens, highlighting the opportunities and co-benefits of low carbon living such as cleaner air, more comfortable homes and healthier lifestyles. We have tried to work with the different sectors, making recommendations that incentivise participants to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. It is now up to the Government to use this bold political mandate in developing its all-of-Government action plan to feed into Ireland's national energy and climate plan. I wish to focus on a few areas of the report that have received a lot of attention. Our report recommends new legislation setting ambitious climate and renewable electricity targets, putting Ireland in line with the latest science from the IPCC which calls for net zero emissions globally by 2050. The proposed legislation would also require five year carbon budgets to be devised by a new climate action council which would supersede the existing Climate Change Advisory Council to set a structured pathway for emissions reductions. The report further recommends that responsibility for climate action be centrally co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach. In order to ensure adequate oversight and accountability, the committee recommends a new permanent Oireachtas committee that will hold Ministers and public officials directly to account for performance on climate action. This new governance framework would be truly transformational and would provide a robust structure to ensure that Ireland gets back on track and stays on track in tackling climate change. I urge the Government and the Oireachtas to fast track these legislative changes. There was broad, cross-party support for setting a long-term price for carbon of €80 by 2030, giving certainty to individuals and businesses to drive the transition towards low-carbon choices, investment and innovation. This should be accompanied by supports and incentives for climate action measures including the protection of those vulnerable to fuel poverty. A public consultation was recommended to help to inform Government's decision on whether to return the revenue to citizens equally as a carbon dividend or to spend it in a targeted manner to address fuel poverty and support climate actions. Those who oppose any increase in the carbon price but criticise Ireland for not meeting its climate targets are pursuing a populist line that is not linked to the reality we face. The vast majority of our political parties recognise that increases in the price of carbon are necessary if we are serious about lowering our emissions trajectory. It would put an increasing cost on greenhouse gas emissions that reflects their social and environmental impact, encouraging business and citizens to pursue lower carbon choices. Increases must, of course, be balanced by enhanced incentives to support households and small businesses to decarbonise such as grant schemes and low interest loans.  In addressing agricultural emissions, the committee was mindful of the importance of this sector to the rural economy as well as the large proportion of our emissions generated by the sector. Members proposed that farmers should be encouraged and supported to engage in climate mitigation measures, some of which should be incentivised through the CAP. We also recommended the implementation of the Teagasc report in full and on-farm measures to reduce emissions and improve the sustainability of farming in Ireland, including through agricultural diversification. Measures to reduce soil carbon emissions and better enhance the carbon sequestration potential of land were also proposed through, for example, sustainable forestry practices, maintaining hedgerows and re-wetting peatlands. The committee also recommended a national strategy for anaerobic digestion. The report acknowledges the urgent need to retrofit the majority of the housing stock in the State in order to reduce emissions from heating. It recommends a needs assessment to ascertain what is required to deliver this to the planned 45,000 homes per annum and to explore increasing that number to 75,000. On energy, the committee was mindful of the huge potential for expanding renewable energy generation in Ireland, especially off shore, to help us to meet our climate targets. The committee recommended actions to further and better exploit Ireland's plentiful renewable energy resources such as by urgently delivering a regulatory framework for offshore energy generation. The report also recommends measures to enable the participation of citizens in large commercial projects, to promote community led projects and support microgeneration. Developing offshore wind generation should become a priority and I urge Government and the Oireachtas to fast track legislation such as the Marine and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill to ensure a regulatory framework can be put in place as soon as possible to enable an offshore industry to develop. Offshore energy projects can contribute to Ireland's energy mix and help us to meet our 2030 targets.It has been a privilege to chair the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, which is supporting Ireland to meet its international climate obligations with a view to ultimately becoming a global leader in climate action. This report represents significant political consensus that will help to frame climate policy in Ireland for the next 15 years. It is my earnest hope that the recommendations in this report are implemented as quickly as possible, particularly those recommendations around the establishment of a new and comprehensive framework for climate policy in Ireland. The existing committee will continue its work over the coming year, working to address areas into which we were not able to delve in sufficient detail. Let the committee's report be the start of the ambitious and immediate actions Government will take to get Ireland back on track, and to keep us on track, to meet our international climate change obligations. This is just the beginning. The hardest job of reducing our emissions is yet to come but with continued cross-party support and much work across Government and all sections of our economy and society we can change the dial and ensure Ireland becomes a climate leader.	spk_352

As the Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I wish to put on the record of this House how important I view the establishment of this special committee. As one who served on the Special Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, I can attest to the value of such a move. The establishment of this committee will give a focus to the climate change issue that it simply cannot get in the midst of a Department's or a committee's consideration of other matters. To put it very simply, climate change has not got the attention or action it deserves because the Department, and my committee, must consider a whole range of other subjects within our remit. Important matters such as public service broadcasting, the media landscape in general, broadband and a myriad of other issues take up time that we could otherwise devote to climate action. The fact that we are going to miss our 2020 targets by a considerable margin illustrates the point that we have not paid sufficient attention to this issue. My statement today is not to criticise the Minister, his Department or my committee, rather the contrary, we need to put substantial resources into developing a proper and effective policy on climate change. It is my view that the establishment of this committee to consider the report of the Citizens' Assembly and ancillary matters is a very positive step in developing such a policy in the short term. Having recently spoken to the Taoiseach on the issue I can assure the House of his and Fine Gael's complete support in the work this committee will do.	spk_179

It is a local road which has been an ongoing issue for residents there for many years. The county council has acquired land in order to widen the road and deal with part of the problem, namely that it is very narrow in places. Some work has been done and our call today is for funding to be made available for the most dangerous part of the road. There is a very dangerous bend where there are no sight lines. Schoolchildren travel on this road each day. There are double-decker buses filled with students. As we move into the summer period, the Gaeltacht summer courses will commence and there will be a huge influx of people who will use this road. Thousands of vehicles use it daily and over many years, residents have called for this to be addressed. One more spell of bad weather could seriously undermine the road and we need funding to start the process at least, as it is critical that we start to deal with the most dangerous areas. 	spk_378

Many of the residents would be very happy if the council could even start with that. I accept the procedure here but we will be in contact with Galway County Council.

It is a local road which has been an ongoing issue for residents there for many years. The county council has acquired land in order to widen the road and deal with part of the problem, namely that it is very narrow in places. Some work has been done and our call today is for funding to be made available for the most dangerous part of the road. There is a very dangerous bend where there are no sight lines. Schoolchildren travel on this road each day. There are double-decker buses filled with students. As we move into the summer period, the Gaeltacht summer courses will commence and there will be a huge influx of people who will use this road. Thousands of vehicles use it daily and over many years, residents have called for this to be addressed. One more spell of bad weather could seriously undermine the road and we need funding to start the process at least, as it is critical that we start to deal with the most dangerous areas. 	spk_378
Hildegarde Naughton	47	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2018-06-12	dail	32	Road Improvement Schemes	dbsect_29	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. We have to meet Galway County Council and we will be asking it to submit that preliminary appraisal for the project. As I stated, perhaps it could even commence on the critical, really dangerous area of that road. As I understand it, that would cost far less than the total upgrade of the entire section. Many of the residents would be very happy if the council could even start with that. I accept the procedure here but we will be in contact with Galway County Council.

Hildegarde Naughton	47	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2018-05-31	dail	32	Referendum of 25 May: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_2	"As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, I am particularly pleased to speak in this debate. For me, the referendum was not about winning or losing, although that is the obvious outcome of such referendums. It was more about an acknowledgement of how informed debate could change society, how the expert - I stress the word ""expert"" - evidence given to the Citizens' Assembly and then the Oireachtas joint committee changed people's perceptions and minds. It also showed what politicians could achieve when they left their bias outside the door of a committee room and agree to do what was best for the women of Ireland, no matter how much it might conflict with a perviously stated position. We in this House have to learn a valuable lesson from the referendum. The lesson is not to dismiss every suggestion because of some intrinsic bias. The lesson is that we should listen more and speak less. The lesson is that we should gather and analyse the evidence and respond accordingly. That is exactly what occurred in this case and look at what has happened. While I thank my colleagues on the committee, they will excuse me if I reserve the vast majority of my thanks and praise for citizens. They are the people, men but mostly women, who have worked for this result for decades. I praise those who showed huge bravery by telling their own personal and very intimate stories, stories that resonated with people up and down the country, that were communicated to people as they canvassed from house to house, that people remembered and translated into a ""Yes"" vote in the ballot box. I also thank the Together for Yes campaign that did Trojan work on the ground. Its members were so well informed and such an impressive group who worked tirelessly in the campaign. As a Deputy for Galway West which includes south Mayo, I have to mention Savita Halappanavar. No matter how people try to spin it, the expert evidence is that the eighth amendment was most definitely a contributory factor in her death. Professor Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran who conducted the case review gave clear and concise evidence to the committee in that regard. I acknowledge Savita today and also thank her family for their dignified contributions to the referendum debate. I acknowledge the clear leadership given by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris. While I am not holding up a sign declaring my undying love, I think all sides of the House will agree that he deserves great praise for the understanding and compassion he showed for women in crisis pregnancies.  I also thank the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, who originally agreed to set up the Citizens' Assembly which was invaluable in the process and Deputy Leo Varadkar who, since he became Taoiseach, has at all times supported the referendum being put to the people."	spk_9

Hildegarde Naughton	47	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2018-04-18	dail	32	Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill 2018: Second Stage [Private Members]	dbsect_32	"I welcome the discussion on this Bill. I thank Deputies Ruth Coppinger, Mick Barry and Paul Murphy for introducing it. It is understandable the media and others concentrated on the substantive issues discussed at the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, but it should be noted that sex education was also an important part of the committee's thinking. We made specific ancillary recommendations in relation to sex education. The majority report of the committee concluded that ""there is a clear link between effective sex education and lower levels of crisis pregnancies"". The committee heard overwhelming evidence to that effect. It is obvious that we need improvements in sexual health and relationships education in schools and youth clubs. The committee noted ""the ongoing developments that are taking place in respect of relationship and sexuality education (RSE) and social, personal and health education (SPHE) in our schools"" but expressed ""specific concern in relation to what is happening at second level"". The report continued:The Committee’s concerns can be summarised as follows.(a) For many schools, sex education is delivered as part of religious education and furthermore it is delivered on an ad-hoc basis, for example not being covered until late in the education cycle.(b) Many teachers are not comfortable teaching RSE and therefore it is left to a minority of teachers or it is outsourced to an agency.(c) As the Committee understands matters, such agencies and their use by schools are not regulated and those delivering the course are not required to have a teaching qualification. It therefore appears to the Committee that any person can set up as an agency to deliver sex education.(d) The ethos of the school can influence how RSE course content is delivered.Regardless of whether we are comfortable with it, young people engage in sexual activity. Therefore, they need to hear about the pitfalls of having unprotected sex with regard to pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. They also need to hear about proper contraception and relationships. They need to hear facts about abortion. They need to hear all of this in an absolutely unbiased fashion. They need facts, not beliefs. Young people need far more than a few classes in which they are taught about the biology of reproduction and puberty. The word ""sex"" or any discussion of it is still something to be avoided among some people and groups. Young people have no such hang-ups about it. They are very conscious of the world around them and have access to more information online than we ever had. To illustrate why is it so important that we educate our young people on sex and relationships in school, I would like to quote from an article in Sex education matters in primary schools because four-year-olds ask where babies come from, five-year-olds browse the internet and six-year-olds want to be popular with their friends. Sex education matters at home because children want their parents to be the first people to talk to them about growing up, sex and relationships. Yet many parents say they lack confidence to answer their children's questions frankly. Sex education matters in secondary schools especially because this is a time when young people come under new pressures from their peers and are reaching for more independence and considering their own views on love, romance and what is acceptable or unacceptable for them.I welcome the Minister's announcement on 3 April that a major review of relationship and sexuality education in schools will be carried out. The Joint Committee on Education and Skills recently invited submissions on its review of sexual health and relationship education, including contraception, consent and related matters. It is welcome that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Department of Education and Skills are among the organisations invited to submit written submissions. As I read it, the Bill seeks to address the problems I have mentioned through primary legislation. This is something I welcome. I look forward to engaging with the Deputies as the legislation progresses through the Houses."	spk_507
Hildegarde Naughton	47	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2018-02-22	dail	32	Project Ireland 2040: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_29	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the statements. Project Ireland 2040 is the result of significant consultation both with parties in the House and throughout the country. Given the failure of Fianna Fáil's national spatial strategy, NSS, it is remarkable to hear many of its members criticising this plan. Not one of the 22 fastest growing towns in the State between 2002 and 2016 was a NSS gateway or hub settlement. The strategy did not aid balanced development and there are now greater distances between where people live and where they work. What Fianna Fáil did, metaphorically or otherwise, was troop every one of its Deputies and Senators into a room to ask them what they wanted for their constituencies and they got it. That is not a strategy; that is parish-pump politics at its worst. I represent west Galway and south Mayo and the strategy did nothing for Galway or the west.There was no investment in transport, housing or health, nothing. I am happy to outline some of what this Government's plan will do, not only for Galway but for the region. Our plan will provide funding for the Galway city ring road. This will provide relief from traffic congestion in order to implement smarter mobility and public transport measures. The project is currently at design and environmental assessment phase. A new elective hospital in Galway is also being funded. This will drastically reduce waiting times for elective surgery, not just for Galway but for the whole of the Saolta hospital group, which stretches all the way from Donegal to Galway and as far east as Athlone. A new emergency department will be built at University Hospital Galway. Replacement and further radiation oncology facilities are funded. There is funding for new patient accommodation for Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and a new ambulance service base in Merlin Park. The N50 Moycullen bypass will also be funded, which will reduce congestion in Moycullen and provide a safer route, with better journey times and better journey time certainty that will improve access to the west and in particular to Connemara. The technological university for the Connacht-Ulster alliance consortium will get funding for significant new buildings which will be provided to the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, the Institute of Technology, Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology in its bid for technological university status. The Government is committed to providing €15 million to the European city of culture 2020 project. There will be investment in national heritage, which includes Coole Park and Connemara National Park in County Galway. Gaeltacht investment includes the development of tourism facilities in Ceantar na nOileán in the Connemara Gaeltacht, investment in the Aran Islands, the development of improved pier infrastructure in Inis Óirr and the construction of new co-operative offices and community facilities on Inis Meáin. There is an investment programme for ongoing safety and maintenance and necessary new developments at Rossaveal Fishery Harbour Centre. Towns and villages with populations of up to 10,000 people, places such as Oranmore and Claregalway, along with rural areas, can benefit from a new rural regeneration and development fund worth €1 billion nationally over ten years. Under the sports capital programme communities and clubs across Galway and the west including in rural areas can bid for over €100 million in capital funding over the next four years. A new large-scale sports infrastructure fund of €100 million is being established for larger sports projects where the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amounts available under the current sports capital programme. That is what the Government's plan will deliver for Galway and the west; not parish pump politics but infrastructural investment in Galway, the west and north west that has been badly needed for decades. I absolutely commend this plan to the House.	spk_239

As Chairperson of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have no fixed view on whether offshore oil and gas exploration should be banned permanently and I might in time come to the conclusion that they should be. The only view I offer at this stage is that this legislation should probably not be continued in this House without the matter being carefully considered and in a more holistic fashion. The Minister of State with responsibility for natural resources has previously invited the committee, of which I am Chair and of which Deputy Bríd Smith is a member, to hold a broad policy debate on national energy policy. It is something the committee should do. We need to hear expert witnesses who can give evidence on this issue and also to hear from those who have differing views on the topic. Only then, when all the potential pros and cons have been evaluated and discussed, should legislation be drafted. This is not only about banning fossil fuel exploration in Irish territorial waters. It is about competitiveness, climate change and security of energy supply. Deputy Bríd Smith may be surprised to hear that I am probably close to her position on this issue. I would ideally like to have a situation where fossil fuels are a thing of the past. However, I urge the Deputy to consider progressing this on an all-party basis, with due consideration of supply security and other issues.	spk_361

Hildegarde Naughton	47	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2018-01-17	dail	32	Report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution: Statements	dbsect_25	"As a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, I will concentrate on my journey towards the position that I took. Regarding the committee's approach, while we could have built on the work of the Citizens' Assembly, we regarded this as an evidence gathering stage and we brought our own judgments to bear on the issues having listened to the experts. It is fair to say that, for many of us, this was a major learning exercise that allowed us to make informed decisions on what was a most divisive and difficult issue. I consider myself pro-life and I would greatly prefer it if no woman ever had to seek an abortion. However, I came to the committee with an open mind. I was willing to listen to the experts and make an evidence-based decision. Every Deputy would agree that we are in the Oireachtas to make the best decisions for citizens based on expert evidence and not our own preconceived ideas. I was conscious of issues around rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality and the availability of termination of pregnancy in such cases. That was as far as my thinking went prior to my committee membership. I have one caveat regarding the committee's final report - I did not vote to allow abortion on health grounds. While I appreciate the reasoning behind the position that the majority took, I am of the view that decriminalising the termination of pregnancy would be sufficient. It would give enough scope to clinicians to make whatever good faith decisions they needed to make to protect the lives of women. The ancillary recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and the all-party Oireachtas committee are as important as the issue itself. For example, improved sex education and access to contraception, obstetric and maternity care, counselling and bereavement support services are equally important. Ireland has been a cold house for victims of sexual violence since the foundation of the State. I do not intend to go back over high-profile cases in which the State failed vulnerable men, women and children, but I would be failing in my duty if I did not mention Joanne Hayes. I am glad to see that the Taoiseach has apologised to Joanne on behalf of the State. No apology or monetary recompense could ever be enough to atone for what was done to her. Let us be clear - she was not believed because she was a woman. There was no evidence to back up the preposterous accusations being made, yet she was mentally tortured by organs of the State. The evidence that our committee heard was conclusive, particularly that from Mr. Tom O'Malley. It would be practically impossible to legislate for terminations in cases of rape or incest, as doing so would require some form of proof of rape. Obviously, waiting for a conviction would be practically impossible. For understandable reasons, some women never feel able to report a rape. There is also the question of re-traumatising a woman where she has already been raped and is now pregnant as a result. There is also the matter of the availability of the abortion pill. When doing a simple Google search for ""abortion pill"", the first few results will be for the website of the UK company from which such medicines can be bought with ease. The latest figures estimate that up to 1,800 women in Ireland use the abortion pill every year. These pills are illegal here, are taken unsupervised and are dangerous without medical supervision. In the absence of shutting down the Internet, we will never be able to stop women in crisis pregnancies - women who are desperate, alone and afraid - from taking them. We cannot have a garda at every ferry port and airport in Ireland searching for them. Are we really suggesting a return to some kind of ""contraceptive train"" scenario? If we do nothing, some woman in the not-too-distant future will rupture her uterus and die. It has happened elsewhere and will happen here. I wish to be categorical, in that no matter what the House or, ultimately, the people decide, the abortion pill will still be available and will continue to be used. Let us not close our eyes to that fact. Do we do the usual Irish thing of ignoring it and pretending it goes away or do we do the courageous thing and actually deal with it by taking the only practical option, namely, legalising and regulating the abortion pill up to the medically recommended limit of 12 weeks? I accept the differing views within the House and the wider country. I wish that I could have come to a different conclusion, but the evidence simply is not there to say that the "	spk_382
Hildegarde Naughton	46	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2017-10-26	dail	32	National Planning Framework: Statements	dbsect_2	I am glad to speak in this debate and will limit my comments to issues relating to proper allocation of resources on a national basis. In so doing, I endorse IBEC’s call for an ambitious long-term planning and investment strategy for Ireland to redress the growing imbalance between the regions and the greater Dublin area. The Minister of State and Government understand the importance of redressing this imbalance. What we need is an implementation mechanism that will deliver change. I seek confirmation that implementing legislation for the framework will include a requirement for all Departments to prepare budgets in accordance with projected growth figures and that budgets should be allocated accordingly. It should also include the requirement for a formal review on a biannual basis of actual growth against projected growth and where growth projections are not being met, appropriate action should be taken.  Given the planned growth in the regions, will the Minister of State confirm that national agencies such as the National Transport Authority and other national entities that are directly funded by the State will be given a mandate encompassing the entire State and not just Dublin? The impression in rural Ireland is that many national agencies are overly concentrated on Dublin-centric issues. Galway has a particular problem where some 7,000 workers experience near-constant gridlock in Parkmore business park. Our national agencies must become more involved in resolving difficulties outside of Dublin. A number of specific projects are contained in the draft, including the proposed development of a new science and innovation park in Cork. Will they be replicated in Galway to service the west of Ireland?  Will the Minister confirm that services required to support the increased population in Galway and the west will be appropriately budgeted for? Given that the current ageing facilities at University Hospital Galway, UHG, are not fit for purpose and do not provide an appropriate environment to safely manage the current and future care needs of the population of the west and north west, can the Minister confirm that an appropriate budget will be allocated for a new acute hospital to service Galway and the region? UHG is designated as a centre of excellence for the west and north west, from Donegal down to Clare and as far east as Athlone, covering a population of more than 800,000. Some 196 senior clinicians working in UHG have told the Minister for Health it is completely unsuitable and a new acute hospital is required urgently. We can talk about science parks and roads from here to Timbuctoo but the health infrastructure in the west is crumbling and we should reorder our priorities to ensure the more than 800,000 people in the west and north west get the best care in the best facilities possible. According to projections by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, reported on the news this morning, Ireland’s population is on course to increase by almost a quarter by 2030, which, combined with a projected increase of up to 94% in people aged 80 or over, will have significant implications for the health service. This will have considerable consequences in the west and north west where our hospital infrastructure is already not fit for purpose. Nobody expects a hospital to appear overnight but we must start planning for a major acute hospital for the region. Otherwise, as the ESRI report clearly shows, our health service will in no way be able to cater for the increase in population.  As An Taisce notes, the history of Irish planning has been marked by successive implementation failures of plans and strategies. It is the biggest obstacle to achieving the goals of any policy. An Taisce's considered opinion is that the standard necessary to avoid the mistakes of the past is that local authorities and regional assemblies “shall comply with the National Planning Framework”. Equally all Government expenditure needs to comply with the national planning framework. I fully agree with those sentiments. Most of us in this House have had experience in local government as members of various local authorities. How many of us have seen various strategies by various Governments go down the black hole of local government? If this plan is to succeed, it is necessary for the executives of local authorities to be made accountable to Government for the implementation of national policy.  I very much welcome the national planning framework. I commend the Minister of State on his sterling work to date. It is an opportunity to properly construct a framework that will serve the infrastructural needs of Ireland for a generation.	spk_12

Constitutionally, of course, it will remain the function of Government to appoint judges. The Bill will not change that. What it will change is the somewhat  While I welcome the general thrust of the proposed legislation, I have a number of concerns. There is a well-known legal maxim,  The Chief Justice, whoever holds that office, is the foremost judge in the country. It is he or she who swears in the President and who takes the oath from judges being appointed. There is no reason the Chief Justice should be debarred from becoming chair of the commission. Finally, the Bill proposes that a judge of neither the Circuit or District Court will be a member of the commission. This is an oversight as both courts account for the vast majority of legal business transacted in the State. They are also the courts in which the vast majority of solicitors and barristers practice every day. While I support the thrust of the Bill, there are a number of issues about which I have a particular concern. Other Members share those concerns. This is a very important Bill. The independence, quality and reputation of our Judiciary hangs on it. I ask the Minister to address these issues as it is debated on all Stages.	spk_465

I welcome this debate and the opportunity to discuss the report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, of which I was a member. I thank my fellow colleagues who sat on the committee as well as the committee secretariat, the Trinity team and, in particular, the Chairman, Deputy Róisín Shortall, who worked so diligently on the report. There is nothing startling in this document. At its core, it emphasises a move away from the traditional hospital setting to a more community-based approach to the delivery of our health services. Inpatient hospitalisation is required for some medical conditions.However, community health care is appropriate for numerous conditions and it offers many benefits. Patients who do not need intensive medical care can receive care in their own homes from registered nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers and allied professionals. Nurses perform tasks such as changing dressings, monitoring and administering medications, drawing blood samples for laboratory tests and educating patients and family members. Home health aides perform tasks such as assisting patients with personal hygiene, preparing meals and helping patients eat, checking vital signs and performing light housekeeping tasks, allowing patients to remain in their own homes with their families while receiving the help that they need. If nothing else in this report was implemented, a properly resourced and efficient primary care structure throughout this country could transform our system for the better. It would mean elderly residents in nursing homes would not longer have to be admitted through accident and emergency departments to get intravenous antibiotics. It would mean elderly and ill people in our community having the most basic of treatments in, or close to, their homes. It would mean general practitioners having access to diagnostics and a range of services currently only provided in a hospital setting. If I could distil our report down into one sentence it would be: there are a large number of patients admitted to our acute hospitals who do not need to be there. Their needs can, and should be, met in the community. I thank the Minister, Deputy Harris, for his positive comments and his clear understanding of the report and the health care needs of the country. The implementation of the report will require an injection of funds both in capital costs and ongoing expenditure into the future. The report requires significant expenditure annually and I look forward to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's costing of the proposals.	spk_252

Hildegarde Naughton	46	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2017-03-02	dail	32	Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_8	I very much welcome this legislation. There have been some positive developments in the area of victims of crime in recent years such as the establishment of the Victims of Crime Office, which was set up in 2008, and the development of a victims charter. However, the developments are not legislatively based and are therefore less effective in protecting victims. As Maria McDonald of the Victims' Rights Alliance stated:For the first time victims will have rights and for the first time they will be able to go to court to protect those rights. We've had a victim's charter in this country since 2010 but it has no legal force. This has legal force. I would like to raise one issue that has also been raised by other Members. The impact analysis indicates that this legislation has no additional cost to the Exchequer. While that may be true on the face of it, I wonder whether sufficient consideration has been given to the additional cost of training staff in many State agencies such as the Garda and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. If victims are to be supported as they should be they will need proper advice, referral and support. To do that in an efficient and effective manner staff working in the State agencies involved will have to have sufficiently trained. I know the Minister is cognisant of that and has increased funding to both the Victims of Crime Office and Cosc. I would just request that this issue be kept under review to ensure that we have sufficient resources to effectively implement the spirit and letter of this legislation. The legislation is a very positive step forward for victims of crime in this jurisdiction and I very much welcome it.	spk_69
Hildegarde Naughton	46	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2017-02-23	dail	32	Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_12	I know there are justifiable complaints about the time the legislation has taken in getting here, I am glad this day has arrived. To be frank, when Fine Gael came to office, the economy was imploding to such an extent that this issue was not progressed as speedily as was warranted. It should also be stated that whereas other countries have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we in Ireland are always conscious of having our domestic house in order before we do such things. There would be little point in ratifying the convention and introducing legislation to rectify errors or gaps afterwards. At this point I offer words of appreciation to a Galway native and world expert in disability law, Professor Gerard Quinn of the National University of Ireland, Galway. He was instrumental in the drafting of the disability convention, both as part of an international group of disability non-governmental organisations and as part of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. Anybody familiar with the history of the convention will know what an enormous contribution he made. With regard to the legislation, there are a number of areas that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission would like amended or have greater emphasis put upon. The same applies to various disabilities representative groups. I know the Minister of State will take due cognisance of these as the Bill goes through the House, as there are other issues not included in the published Bill that will be taken as amendments. I will clarify one issue. There has been a discussion about Ireland having obligations under European Union, EU, law because the Union has for the first time signed up to the international human rights treaty. That is only partially true. The EU has oversight in terms of existing competencies and this treaty does not create any more. I very much welcome this legislation and look forward to its speedy passage through the House.	spk_215
Hildegarde Naughton	45	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2016-11-09	dail	32	Rent Controls	dbsect_24	I thank the Minister of State for taking this issue. The Minister for Health will be aware of the serious difficulties that have faced patients and staff at University Hospital Galway, UHG, in recent years. I will not go over all the challenges again, save to say that it is among the worst performing hospitals in terms of accident and emergency waiting times and inpatient and outpatient waiting lists. This week, UHG enters its seventh week of code black due to overcrowding and doctors and nursing staff at the hospital stated today that overcrowding is endangering the lives of people in the region. In response to a parliamentary question I tabled recently, the Health Service Executive informed me that since 2006, capital expenditure at the Galway University Hospitals Group has exceeded €109 million. I do not expect the Minister of State will know how many additional beds this investment provided but the HSE informs me that the number of beds available in the two hospitals in the group, namely, UHG and Merlin Park Hospital, has decreased by 157 since this investment was made. The capacity of both hospitals declined from 812 beds in January 2006 to 655 beds as of October this year. In the meantime, the population has increased substantially, from 4.2 million in 2006 to 4.7 million this year. The ageing population has also increased significantly. Furthermore, UHG has been designated a centre of excellence for major specialties such as oncology and cardiology in the meantime. This means the hospital is supposed to provide expert care in serious cases for approximately 800,000 people living in an area extending from County Donegal to County Clare and eastwards as far as Athlone.  Additional beds are required. The new 75-bed block nearing completion will provide few new beds as other wards will need to close to facilitate access to the new block. In addition, every time a new extension is built at University Hospital Galway, car parking space is removed. The psychiatric unit under construction is being built on the staff car park. There are unapproved plans for a badly needed accident and emergency unit which will, in all probability, eat further into the space available for car parking. It is a simple fact that UHG is in the wrong place and finds itself unable to cope. It is astonishing that there are only 73 inpatient beds in Merlin Park Hospital. I understand most of these beds are occupied by long-stay geriatric patients. Merlin Park Hospital is located in a vast complex encompassing approximately 150 acres of State owned land. At this critical point, is it not clear that we need a new hospital on this vastly under-utilised site?	spk_216
Hildegarde Naughton	45	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2016-11-09	dail	32	Rent Controls	dbsect_24	I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I accept that significant advancements have been made in the quality of care provided at University Hospital Galway since 2006. However, the Minister of State will accept that the crisis facing the hospital is one of capacity, not quality. There can be little criticism of the standard of care provided for patients in Galway once they are admitted. We are extremely fortunate to have an outstanding team of clinicians and nurses at the hospital who are doing an exceptional job in exceptionally difficult circumstances. The greatest challenge facing us, on which the Government will be judged, is one of access to treatment and having sufficient capacity in hospital to meet increasing demand. The figures for bed capacity and capital spending show that we are not meeting that challenge. The University Hospital Galway campus has reached developmental saturation point. The terms of the Galway city development plan and spatial constraints on the site mean no more beds can be delivered. Any further capital spending on the site would be a waste. Up to €18 million was spent on a 75-bed ward block due to open next year. However, two wards will close as part of the development, meaning that it will not provide a single extra bed. The problem is that University Hospital Galway has the longest waiting lists in the State and, typically, the highest number of patients on trolleys, but we cannot increase capacity on its current campus. Will the Minister of State, therefore, agree that the solution to the crisis lies away from the existing site? Will she agree that future capital investment should be so focused, rather than spending millions of euro on new infrastructure which will offer no additional beds and no hope to the tens of thousands on hospital waiting lists?	spk_218

Hildegarde Naughton	45	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2016-11-03	dail	32	Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)	dbsect_6	"I welcome this legislation. Given that over 80% of teenagers have a social networking profile, the law needs to adapt to protect children from abuse. Over recent years, the Internet has become a significant player in the possible exposure of children to such abuse. There are now many ways to contact children for purposes of grooming. Many children are exposed to inappropriate material such as cyberbullying, adult pornography, websites that promote self-harm, suicide and eating disorders, online hate material and extreme forms of obscene, violent and offensive material. These are not distant threats. They are real and present and need to be addressed. Therefore, I am pleased that this legislation will strengthen existing provisions on online grooming, images of child abuse and child prostitution. It is good to see the criminalising of any communication with a child on the Internet, a mobile phone or social media for sexual exploitation through technology. As UNICEF has made clear, all girls and boys have the right to survive, grow and ""be protected from violence, exploitation and abuse"" in all settings, including offline and online environments. On a related note, it is right and proper for the State to ensure its laws are up to standard in this area. There is a challenge for parents, guardians and people in roles of responsibility, including teachers. If we would not let a child or someone under our protection leave the house or school without knowing where the child was going, the same thought should be afforded to online activity. It is true that many children are streets ahead of their parents, or even some teachers, when it comes to modern technology. It provides a challenge. I would like to think that along with proper legislation and enforcement, the State might afford some level of support to people in positions of authority in order that they can best protect children. Members of this House have a duty to legislate according to the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which protects children from all kinds of discrimination, abuse and neglect, including sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. It mandates this House to protect children from information and material that is injurious to their well-being as well as from arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy. These provisions are reflected in the Bill before the House. Online activity is an area that has provoked warranted calls for the protection of children, particularly with regard to social media. While that should always be the primary consideration, we should be careful not to limit the huge potential that technology offers our young people. Balanced but powerful legislation is required to allow children to enjoy all the benefits of online activity while prohibiting malicious activity and criminalising those who would abuse the natural inquisitiveness of a child’s mind. In my view, this Bill represents such a balance. While I acknowledge the concerns of some people regarding the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services, I emphasise that this legislation would have prevented what happened in Galway District Court earlier this week when two young women whose circumstances we do not know were convicted and fined for prostitution. Surely this legislation is a better alternative."	spk_80
Hildegarde Naughton	45	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2016-07-12	dail	32	Harbours and Piers Development	dbsect_26	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for affording me the opportunity to raise this issue which is of the utmost importance to the people of Galway and the broader western region. At University Hospital Galway we are blessed with a team of world-class doctors and health care professionals, but they are struggling beneath the weight of inadequate resources and unmanageable demand. As the Minister of State will be abundantly aware, the hospital is beset with the country's longest waiting list, has the most cancelled procedures and frequently has the most patients on trolleys. In the Minister's defence and that of his predecessors, it is not the case that no money has been made available for capital spending on the hospital in recent years, but in times of scarcity it is equally important to consider how money is spent, as well as how much. The central government funding invested in capital projects at University Hospital Galway in recent years represented a wasted opportunity. The hospital campus has dated facilities and its capacity to cater for the needs of a growing and ageing population cannot be expanded owing to restrictions on its current site. I will cite two of the most recent capital projects to illustrate this point.  This year will see the opening of a new 75-bed ward block. For some time, this prospect gave people in the hospital's catchment area hope that it would go some way towards alleviating the seemingly perpetual overcrowding crisis. However, it emerged in recent months that there were three wards being closed to make way for the new €18 million block and that there would be no net increase in bed capacity once the block's doors opened. This was confirmed in letters from the chief operations officer to the planning authority, in a letter to me from the hospital's general manager and in briefings by senior management of the group's patient council. A key reason for this is that the additional beds cannot be provided under the terms of the city development plan without creating an equal number of car parking spaces, for which there is no room on the campus. That brings me to the second capital project. The hospital undertook to build a new two-storey parking facility on the site of an existing car park a few years ago. Remarkably, the project's net impact following completion was that there were 80 fewer spaces. We are building car parks that do not result in the creation of extra parking spaces and ward blocks that do not result in the provision of extra beds.We need to stop this, take stock of why this is happening and decide what should happen next. Given the gravity and scale of the overcrowding crisis at University Hospital Galway, I consider it a shame that scarce resources were poorly utilised on capital projects that would offer no respite from the crisis. It is one thing in the midst of an economic crisis to say there is no money but it is quite another to have the money and waste it in a way that would do anything other than confer the maximum possible benefit on the maximum number of people. That, I fear, is what has come to pass in the two instances I have outlined today. The present set of circumstances is not tenable. Put simply, the region’s population is going to grow but the hospital’s capacity is going to remain the same. The sooner we realise that a longer-term vision is required in the form of a new facility on the grounds of Merlin Park University Hospital, which is on State-owned land, the sooner we can restore confidence in the fact that the current and future health care needs of the people of the west will be catered for. Endemic short-termism appears to have overtaken most of the planning on the existing University Hospital Galway site. Bearing in mind the Minister’s vision and the setting up of the all-party Oireachtas committee, of which I am a member, to consider a ten-year plan for the health service, does the Minister of State agree that since University Hospital Galway is the major acute hospital for the west, we now need to grasp the nettle and look at the bigger picture?	spk_271

Hildegarde Naughton	45	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2016-07-06	dail	32	Broadband Service Provision: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_29	It is a simple fact that rural areas need State intervention if they are to provided with high-speed broadband. The Minister will note recent figures released by the IDA indicating that it is missing its own targets on investment in areas outside Dublin and Cork. That means rural Ireland is missing out. Leaving aside companies such as Google, people trying to set up or maintain small businesses are at a distinct disadvantage. When I talk about infrastructure I include areas such as access to reliable power, clean water and high-speed broadband.Access to high-speed broadband is a problem for over 30% of the population. When one compares Ireland to other highly developed countries in Europe, we are lagging behind countries such as Latvia, Hungary and Poland. Iceland has a 95% broadband penetration rate.  In 2012 the Government task force highlighted all of these issues, as well as the importance of high-speed broadband for economic growth, jobs, boosting small and medium enterprises, schools being able to access online tools and combatting rural isolation. Only a few years after Independence, the State embarked on a major challenge with regard to rural electrification, and the roll-out of broadband is equivalent to that. It was only in 2003 that the last two areas in the country were connected to electricity mains, in Inishturk and Inishturbot. There is a five-year roll-out plan for broadband to every house and business in the country. It is just as important as rural electrification. I would support any move by the Government to make that happen.	spk_362
Hildegarde Naughton	45	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2016-06-22	dail	32	The Arts: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_31	"I very much welcome the debate both as a Member of this House and as a long-time supporter of and participant in the arts. I am also pleased the motion is not being opposed. As a Government we are cognisant of the value of the arts, and, as our programme for partnership Government notes, we promise to ""work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve"". The previous budget saw a 12% increase in funding for the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. We have a tendency to look for value for money in public spending. There is nothing wrong with that. For every €1 the Arts Council invests, more than 70 cent returns directly to the Exchequer in taxes, and when the Arts Council invests the remaining 30 cent it translates to a turnover of €2.50, which is more than an eight-fold return. However, that is only one side of the equation. The other is the intrinsic and unquantifiable value of the arts. While we might argue about the recent change of designation for the Department, what it means to those involved in the arts is that artists feel they are not being valued as they should be. That is an understandable concern. I know that the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is fully committed to the promotion of the arts. She has reiterated that point this evening. The problem is the message. The arts are all about symbology. The change in designation was a message that was heard loud and clear by the arts community. If the ideal of the arts in this country is Mozart, then I think we introduced Salieri by mistake. As a person from Galway, a county that is putting forward its bid to become the European Capital of Culture in 2020, and given that Galway city is synonymous with events such as the Galway Arts Festival, the Macnas parade and the Cúirt festival, I would find it impossible to explain the importance of the arts to the very fabric of Galway and the west, and to the entire island of Ireland. I agree that the arts needs more money, support and programmes to be put in place, but most important of all it needs to be valued. The Government will do all it can to increase funding to the arts. Likewise, I will do everything I can to ensure we deliver on that commitment."	spk_240
Hildegarde Naughton	45	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2016-06-02	dail	32	Mental Health Commission Reports	dbsect_36	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this vital health issue for the west and the Minister of State for attending to answer my question. She is aware that the HSE has indicated that it intends to close the DEXA scanning unit in Merlin Park University Hospital in Galway. I am informed a reprieve has been granted at the eleventh hour, but there is absolutely no plan for the service to move forward; nor are we assured that it will not close in the future. Ireland has approximately 91 DEXA scanners in use. The DEXA scanner situated at Merlin Park University Hospital is the only scanner not privately operated in the entire west. I am told there is a 20 year waiting list, as it stands, for a DEXA scan in Merlin Park University Hospital. No referral has been processed in three years owing to a lack of staff. Even if the unit is not closed, there will be no reduction in the waiting list owing to the lack of staff. Thousands of euros were donated by the local cystic fibrosis chapter and a charitable bequest was made to purchase the machine. Despite this, the HSE seems to be unable to staff the unit. Since 2009 GUH staff have educated Irish health professionals on best practice for DEXA and other technologies, running International Society for Clinical Densitometry, ISCD, courses and certification examinations, which qualifications are recognised throughout the world.GUH was a centre of excellence for bone densitometry with the only DEXA specialist radiographer in post in Ireland, Professor John Carey, who is the vice president of the ISCD. GUH also established one of the first DEXA centres in the country in 1999 and one of the first fracture liaison programmes. GUH was the first Irish site to gain recognition from the Capture the Fracture programme, which recognises centres of excellence around the world. While I could continue to recite reasons for the necessity to make and keep this unit properly operational, I think the Minister would agree that any suggested closure is a highly retrograde step. There is enormous public anger building that such a service could be threatened with closure in the west, forcing people again to travel to Dublin for what is a reasonably basic service. I am told that the difficulty with the service appears to be the hiring and retention of qualified staff. Osteoporosis is one of the most common diseases in the world today, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. There are no symptoms or clinical features until a fracture occurs. One in two women and one in five men over 50 will experience a fracture related to osteoporosis in their lifetime. A postmenopausal woman's annual risk of fracture is greater than her combined risk of all cardiovascular disease and invasive breast cancer combined. Ireland has one of the highest incidences of osteoporosis and hip fracture in the world. One in three men and one in five women admitted to our hospitals with a hip fracture are dead within a year following the fracture. This is almost double many other countries and well above the UK and EU norms. Many others require lengthy hospital stays in nursing homes, for example. The cost of treating osteoporosis-related fractures is close to €1 billion annually. Many fractures are preventable by identifying people at risk or diagnosing osteoporosis before a fracture occurs. DEXA scans play a critical role as they are the gold standard in testing to identify people with low bone mass, to diagnose osteoporosis before a fracture occurs and to monitor those on treatment. DEXA is cheap, very safe and very cost-effective. Identifying people early helps them to reduce their risk of fracture. Musculoskeletal diseases are among the commonest diseases in the world and the commonest cause of disability among men and women over 50 years of age in the developed world. New staff were promised for the hospital's DEXA service in 2013 after a business plan was approved by the Saolta executive committee for a clinical specialist radiographer, a clinical nurse and a secretary. Only the radiographer post was finally approved for advertising nationally after two years. No one has applied for the position and neither a nurse nor a secretary was provided. It is, therefore, clear why there is a waiting list of 20 years. The cut-off to the staff for musculoskeletal diseases since the implementation of the moratorium on new staff has had an impact on waiting lists and the welfare of patients. I urge the Minister to intervene directly in this case so this vital service is available for the people of the west and I would also like an assurance that the unit will not again be threatened with closure. It makes no sense ending this service for financial reasons or not staffing the unit properly when keeping it. Making it work effectively will save the taxpayer in the long term.	spk_227

Hildegarde Naughton	45	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2016-06-01	dail	32	Health Care Committee Establishment: Motion (Resumed)	dbsect_24	I very much welcome this debate and the proposal to establish this special all-party committee. It is past time some long-term structure was given to our health service. I will refrain from criticising the HSE and its predecessors for not putting in place such a plan. This is because for decades health authorities in this country have been chasing their tails fire fighting one problem after another rather than planning for the future. This fire fighting was the result of, in a circular but predictable way, a lack of any long-term plan for the health service in this country. If a service is pared down to its most essential parts, as happened during the recent financial crisis, it becomes easier to see where the problems are. This is for another day, however, and the committee has ahead of it probably one of the most important jobs in recent generations. There is nothing more important where we stand now in 2016 than tackling our health problems. What is required now is political maturity and an ability to work together and not stick rigidly to fixed ideological positions. All that matters in any committee deliberations are patient outcomes and a process that leads to a modern, efficient and cost-effective service for everyone, notwithstanding their means. I wish to make one point in this debate which will resonate with Deputies whose constituencies cover rural areas such as mine, or areas of the country outside Dublin. Yesterday, I saw a very interesting figure, that 41% of Irish people live outside urban areas. An urban area is defined as one with a population greater than 1,500. Dublin's population, city and county, is approximately 1.25 million. Dublin, therefore, has just more than a quarter of the entire population of approximately 4.65 million. I mention this because many Deputies in the House would feel the majority of the citizens of this country are playing second fiddle when it comes to infrastructural investment, particularly in health care. Dublin is bursting at the seams in terms of transport, a lack of housing and other areas. Billions can be invested in the cross-city Luas, an airport extension or new hospitals. While I did not agree with much of what the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, John Moran, stated in a recent article, some of it made sense. There is a huge lack of infrastructural investment outside Dublin. This is simply a fact. Health care is one of the most obvious areas. University Hospital Galway is shoehorned into the middle of a medieval city, with no room to park or to expand and no plan for the future except for necessary but short-term replacement building projects. It is supposed to be a centre of excellence but I would try persuading either the staff or the patients going through the accident and emergency department of this. Cancer patients have to queue for hours or even days to be admitted. I could go on and I am sure other Deputies have similar issues in their constituencies. In Galway, we have all of this and an underutilised hospital campus of 150 acres of State-owned land at Merlin Park, a few kilometres away from University Hospital Galway. This is an example of the issues the committee needs to examine. We badly need vision in our health service. I do not for one minute advocate a one for everyone in the audience approach. I fully realise that expertise in a given field has the best outcome for patients if centralised in a specialist centre. I do not advocate a centre of excellence in every town and village in the country. What I advocate is that the committee takes a good hard look at the services offered, how and where they are delivered and imagine our health system in ten years' time. Imagine a system which does not have 90 year old patients endlessly waiting on trolleys, cancer patients endlessly waiting for admission or nurses and doctors at their wits' end trying to cope. Earlier I stated the committee has a hugely challenging task ahead but it is one with huge rewards. This committee, and subsequently this House, have a generational opportunity to create a health service on which all our citizens can rely and of which they can be proud.	spk_370
Hildegarde Naughton	45	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2016-05-31	dail	32	Mental Health Services: Statements (Resumed)	dbsect_26	Mental health and an awareness of it should be included in the national curriculum for schools. The Young People's Mental Health Advisory Group which is part of the National Health Service, NHS, clinical research network recently recommended this in the United Kingdom. We should do the same here. The rationale is that prevention is better than cure and that if problems present in later years, they can be dealt with more effectively. Others have mentioned the stigma attached to mental health as a first obstacle. What better way to tackle this than in early education about mental health while young people are still learning? The NHS indicates that to have maximum access to young people, it is best done through schools. School is also where many young people start to experience mental health problems first. We have had some advances in educating young people about their mental health. MindOut and the Jigsaw mental health project are services that have been very successful. Youth Work Ireland has been offering an excellent service for young people with mental health difficulties across the country. They take up the slack in the State system and prevent even more people from joining waiting lists. However, a more sustained and school based approach is warranted. A host of international, peer-reviewed literature on the subject suggests a multi-level, school based intervention on adolescents' emotional well being is effective. The Oireachtas Library and Research Service also produced a very good spotlight document on promoting mental health in schools. It suggests mental health, rather than being seen as a problem, should be seen as something which requires maintenance and protection. I could not agree more. It is not a problem to be solved but part of who we are, like a limb or an organ. Some mental health difficulties are lifelong. While there may be no cure, in the majority of cases there are ways to enable people to live their lives. It is ongoing and we should not think it is in any way a problem. Our discussions should be about ways to enable people who suffer from mental health difficulties to lead the most fulfilling lives possible. We should be concentrating on promoting physical fitness, exercise and a balanced diet, on developing our mental health awareness and knowledge and on ongoing support and treatment, where necessary. I will make a point which I picked up from a recent social media post and talking to people. Some people, when they hear that a friend or acquaintance is taking anti-depressants to treat depression or anxiety, have a tendency to be critical of the use of anti-depressants. The point was made that some people benefited enormously by taking them. I recently spoke to a person who was infuriated by the suggestion the use of medication was something to be criticised. While the person would prefer not to be taking it, it enables them to avail of non-medical treatments. Medication is often taken as part of an holistic treatment for anxiety or depression which may involve exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy. There is no golden rule. People's mental health issues are complex and multifaceted and require knowledge and understanding. That brings me back to my original point. Where better to impart that knowledge and understanding than in school? The research indicates that mental health promotion programmes are effective in equipping people with the necessary skills to avoid or deal with mental health difficulties. There are great benefits to be had from school-based programmes. They include positive effects on behaviour, social and emotional skills, the ability to learn and achieve academically and increased levels of problem solving in social settings. The World Health Organization estimates that 20% of children and adolescents worldwide experience mental health problems. The OECD reports that 4.5% of Europe's population suffer from depression, with an associated cost of more than €118 billion. In Ireland the cost of poor mental health was estimated to be 2% of GDP, or €2 billion, two years before the economic crisis struck in 2008. Major costs are associated with poor mental health. While there would be a cost involved in placing mental health in the education system curriculum, it is very much warranted, both practically and financially. It would be the right thing to do.	spk_314
Hildegarde Naughton	45	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2016-05-05	dail	32	Crime: Statements	dbsect_4	I represent Galway West, which includes south Mayo. My constituency is partly urban and partly rural. There is sometimes an inability among some to put themselves in the shoes of those who live in isolated communities. Some people sit in an office in Dublin and make decisions on the allocation of Garda resources. I wonder if they realise what it is like not to have anyone or anything within walking distance or what it means when the local post office, Garda station, school or any service may be many miles away on roads that are in less than optimal condition. We may say to people in rural Ireland that mobile patrols will provide policing as efficiently as their local Garda station but it does not resonate. Whether the statistics bear it out, the simple fact is that a local Garda station makes people in rural Ireland feel safer. Their local garda knows everyone in the area, new and old. This is community policing at its most basic and effective. Naturally, I appreciate that we cannot have a Garda station at every point where someone requests one. However, I very much welcome the agreement to mandate the Policing Authority to oversee a review of the boundaries of Garda districts and the dispersal of Garda stations. When that process is complete, I hope Members will adhere to the recommendations and not make a political football out if it. Of course additional Garda numbers will help, and the proposal to increase Garda numbers to 15,000 is very much to be welcomed. In addition to the building of new stations, including the new divisional headquarters in Galway, this will go a long way to alleviating concerns among the public. Additionally, the new Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 introduced a significant tightening to the bail laws and the roll-out of Operation Thor to target rural crime. All that is very welcome. Members should note that the number of homicides and burglaries has actually reduced since 2011, despite assertions to the contrary. However, I fully accept that there are issues other than numbers and statistics. There is ample evidence that the Garda is not resourced in important technical areas. I wish to highlight the report of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate published last December. The report recommends the establishment of a serious and organised crime unit to tackle organised criminal networks. This would include a new cybercrime unit and the assignment of responsibility for serious fraud investigations. A serious and organised crime unit would provide an agile, multidisciplinary investigation team to follow the criminal and not only the crime type.Additionally, it recommends removing functions such as serious fraud investigations and suspicious financial transaction reports from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and placing them within the serious and organised crime unit, SOCU, and the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB. It does not say this just for the sake of it. The inspectorate points to huge shortcomings in the investigation of serious white collar crime. This is not a result of unwillingness on behalf of the excellent gardaí in such units; it is because they have neither the expertise nor resources. For instance, there is a huge financial services sector in Dublin and the plain fact is that it is not being policed as it should be. It cannot be, as the gardaí are not resourced to do so. We all at this stage know the perils of light-touch regulation and enforcement. These are issues that need to be addressed as a matter of priority. Gardaí are the backbone of our civil society. For all our sakes, they need the support they deserve.	spk_43
Hildegarde Naughton	45	Unknown	Galway West	#HildegardeNaughton	2016-04-20	dail	32	Health Services: Statements	dbsect_6	In 2002, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Micheál Martin, published the Codd report, entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity - A National Review. In his written foreword he said:For some time, it has been evident that the capacity of our acute hospital system has not kept pace with the increasing demands being imposed on it. The consequences of that under-capacity are well known, i.e. cancellation of elective admissions, long delays in accident and emergency departments, waiting lists for elective procedures and unacceptably high bed occupancy levels in the major hospitals.I use this quote merely to illustrate that very little has changed. Operations are still being deferred and there are long waiting lists and terrible stories of elderly and ill patients lying for days on trolleys. We must construct a way forward for our health system. I refer to the Parliament and not the Government on its own or parties or anybody with ideological or immutable beliefs in the supposed best way forward. There is no perfect way, but surely there is a much better way to provide better results for our citizens. From the days of Dr. Browne, ideas for the reform of health service have been stymied by vested interests - medical, political and others. If we go on in this fashion, our health service will never be fixed. If this debate were to result in Members of the House merely leaving down their political cudgels and resisting the temptation to knock metaphorical lumps out of one another, it would be something to show the people that we are serious about fixing the system and that we are not playing politics with the issue. This is a new Dáil and it is time for a new start. There have, of course, been improvements in the health service over recent years. If we were honest, we would acknowledge that the last three Ministers have made improvements, but how can a Minister direct health policy when he or she is constantly firefighting? I will compare the approach in my constituency, Galway West, with that of Cork to illustrate the problems of health management thinking in this country. These are the people who advise the Minister and devise service plans year after year and decade after decade. Cork is currently in the early stages of planning a new 300-bed acute hospital to relieve pressure on other hospitals and provide state-of-the-art accommodation. One of the first things stipulated was that the chosen site should be at least 50 acres, and preferably 100 acres. This was to provide room for expansion and the provision of all necessary ancillary services. There is nothing shocking about that. In fact, it proves that good planning is in place. I refer to the plans for University Hospital Galway. It plans to build a 75-bed extension, but health management cannot tell us how many additional beds that will provide. The extension will not be on a 100-acre or even a 50-acre site but, rather, a 42-acre site. The site is hemmed in by major roads on all sides, and there are significant traffic issues and virtually no parking. The site is very cramped and a car park had to be removed to make space for a new mental health unit. University Hospital Galway is not a small local hospital. It is a major acute hospital and one of the busiest in the country. It has the longest waiting lists for inpatient and outpatient treatment in the entire country. It is a regional centre of excellence, offering treatment in a variety of specialisations to patients from Donegal to Clare and as far east as Athlone. It has an occupancy rate of almost 98% and is bursting at the seams. The internationally recognised figure for full occupancy is 85%, yet it is building an extension costing €70 million on an already cramped site and cannot tell us how many beds, if any, it will add. I and others have tried to get answers for months and the hospital simply cannot provide the information. The real fear, which is not unfounded, is that spending a significant sum of money will provide perhaps only seven additional beds. All of this would be bad enough if there was not a second hospital campus in Galway, in Merlin Park, which has been vastly underutilised over the years. It is located on 150 acres of State-owned land and has acres of empty parkland right beside a dual carriageway system. The people of Galway and the rest of Ireland need a state-of-the-art modern acute hospital with sufficient beds. We urgently need a plan to relocate University Hospital Galway to Merlin Park on a phased basis. Local consultants need to take the lead on this. We have had the Codd report on the need for extra bed capacity and the Hanly report on the need for extra consultants, neither of which was implemented. We have lower numbers of consultants than most of the developed world, something which needs to be addressed. To address the issue, consultants need more beds and the development and funding of proper primary care centres in strategic locations to take the pressure off our hospitals and accident and emergency departments.	spk_125
