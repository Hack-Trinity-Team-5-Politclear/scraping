I have repeatedly classified myself as a very strong feminist. I would use many other adjectives but this is an insult. It is a double insult to hold it on International Women\u2019s Day,\u201d Connolly told the D\u00e1il last night.Gendered languageExplaining her viewpoint, she said the wording in its current form is gendered and dated and does need to be changed but she added:Advertisement\u201cThe Constitution tells us that the mother should not be obliged to work outside the home because of economic necessity. Certainly, the wording needs to be changed and the consequences of zoning in on a woman and the parallel developments in Irish society, by a male-dominated patriarchal society were totally unacceptable.\u201cHowever, the concept behind it is the kernel of what this debate should be about and it has not been mentioned. No carer, whether a mother, father or whatever category they work under as the primary carer in a house should be forced out through economic necessity to a different or additional job.\u201cGiven a choice of what the Government is proposing in this referendum and what is there, I would take my chances with what is there and leave it to the judiciary in an appropriate case to interpret it in a modern capacity that does not limit the recognition to a mother but recognises the value of care without which society and the economy cannot function,\u201d said Connolly.\u201cI am now left with a decision to make, which I have almost made, unfortunately. I will strive to keep an open mind,\u201d she said.Connolly went on to state that the existing Article is stronger because what the government is proposing takes away any obligation on the State.Yet to make mind upSpeaking withThe Journaltoday, Connolly said she has no issue with voting \u2018Yes\u2019 on the referendum on family, but is yet to make her mind up on whether she will support the referendum on \u2018women in the home\u2019, given the concerns outlined above.\u201cYes, [the 'women in the home' wording] it has to go but what they are replacing it with is unacceptable. So in the course of my speech, I said given a choice between the two, I\u2019ll take the one that\u2019s there and look for the judges to interpret it,\u201d said the Galway TD.\u201cI think the major argument hasn\u2019t even been touched on, which is no primary carer should be forced to work outside the home for economic necessity. Which is the wording contained in the Constitution, but it\u2019s done in a way that\u2019s obviously unacceptable to all us women,\u201d she said, adding that despite this, the concept still stands.In her D\u00e1il contribution, Connolly cited former Chief Justice, Justice Susan Denham and a judgement she gave 23 years ago.Going into more detail on this, Connolly toldThe Journalthat Denham cited how the \u2018women in the home\u2019 reference assigns worth to the work in the home.The Denham judgement states that Article 41.2 \u2018does not assign women to a domestic role. Article 41.2 to recognises the significant role played by wives and mothers in the home. This recognition and acknowledgement does not exclude women and mothers from other roles. It is a recognition of the work performed by women in the home\u2019.Read NextRelated Reads'Durable' relationships, 'throuples' and care in the home discussed in referendums D\u00e1il debateReferendums: Flac suggests changing 'durable relationships' wording, warns about misinformationSimon Harris claims single-parent families are not adequately recognised in Irish constitution\u201cNow obviously, I have a problem with the word women all the time, but the work is recognised because it is a net benefit for society. And then she goes on to say \u2018this recognition must be construed harmoniously with other articles of the Constitution\u2019,\u201d Connolly\u00a0 said.The Galway TD also cited another judgement \u2013 this one by Justice Murray that states:\u00a0\u201dThe duties and obligations of spouses are mutual and the Constitution implicitly recognises similarly the value of a man\u2019s contribution in the home as a parent.\u201dConnolly said both judges are signaling that the Constitution has to be interpreted as a living document \u201cand in a modern society, quite clearly, we can\u2019t confine it to a woman\u201d.Transport Minister Eamon Ryan responded to Connolly\u2019s comments in the D\u00e1il last night, stating that the \u2018women in the home\u2019 terminology is sexist.When asked if she agreed, Connolly said it is gendered language.\u201cAbsolutely. But my difficulty is what they\u2019re replacing it with. It\u2019s not as strong as what\u2019s in there,\u201d she said, stating that she would prefer to have the judges interpret the current wording \u201cin a modern way\u201d.Given those two choices, she said she trusts the judges\u2019 interpretation but clarified only in that limited context.\u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m happy with it, but I take my chances with that [rather] than what government are giving, which is wishy washy, confining the recognition to care within a home.\u201cNobody, meaning the primary carer, should be forced for economic reasons outside of the home. If we\u2019re going to value carers then that should be the thing we should be discussing. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate that we\u2019re doing that in a rushed way in the D\u00e1il,\u201d said the independent TD.Concluding, she said: \u201cIt was time to do something, to get rid of the sexist language. Yes. But with something more potent, which they haven\u2019t done.\u201dMaking a differenceA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.Over 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.For the price of one cup of coffee each week you can make sure we can keep reliable, meaningful news open to everyone regardless of their ability to pay.Support usLearn MoreAuthorChristina Finnchristinafinn@thejournal.ie@christinafinn8Send Tip or CorrectionView all articlesRead NextMore StoriesRelated TagsCARE REFERENDUMCATHERINE CONNOLLYD\u00e1IL DEBATEMARCH REFERENDUMSREFERENDUMREFERENDUMSVOTEWOMENWOMEN IN THE HOMEEmbed this postTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site600px wide<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/women-in-the-home-catherine-connolly-6275205-Jan2024/?embedpost=6275205&width=600&height=460\" ></iframe>400px wide<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/women-in-the-home-catherine-connolly-6275205-Jan2024/?embedpost=6275205&width=400&height=460\" ></iframe>300px wide<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/women-in-the-home-catherine-connolly-6275205-Jan2024/?embedpost=6275205&width=300&height=460\" ></iframe>Email \u201cTD will 'take her chances' with current 'women in the home' wording rather than 'wishy washy' replacement\u201d.Your EmailRecipient's EmailSubmitFeedback on \u201cTD will 'take her chances' with current 'women in the home' wording rather than 'wishy washy' replacement\u201d.Your FeedbackYour Email (optional)SubmitReport a CommentPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.Please select your reason for reporting...It contains offensive language, is hateful or incites violenceIt contains a libellous/defamatory statementSome other reason...Please give full details of the problem with the comment...SubmitYour VoiceReaders Comments68This isYOURcomments community.
